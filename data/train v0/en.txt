How are we doing on that time, anybody? Neil, are you sort of master of ceremonies on time, yet?
Well, I didn't ...
(Singing) Okay, your DRINKING WATER SUPPLY valve is ON.
How about this ... circuit configuration? GLYCOL RESERVOIR BYPASS valve OPEN?
(Cough) ... BYPASS is OPEN.
RESERVOIR OUT valve CLOSED?
OUT's CLOSED.
IN valve CLOSED?
IN's CLOSED.
ECS RADIATOR FLOW CONTROL, PRIMARY.
...
Hey, Buzz?
Yes.
How would you like the camera?
Okay.
PRIMARY GLYCOL TO RADIATOR valve, NORMAL.
Why don't I leave the dark slide - -
Are we ready for that, you think? What's the time?
30 minutes. ...
... to NORMAL, and check the radiator.
It will take awhile, that's - - _page : 2
Okay, now, is that normal for the discharge pressure to zap down low and to do that? Do you think, Mike?
What's that? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.
When Neil sends the GLYCOL RADIATORS to NORMAL, temporarily, it - -
It drops?
Yes.
The temperature done that?
Yes, pressure - you might get a little drop in it, I don't really know, but it came back up.
Yes, it goes back up.
Alright, Buzz, here's one Hasselblad for you.
Coming around the right-hand couch.
That seems okay.
Buzz?
Yes, just a second.
Okay. I'll just let go of it, Buzz; it will be hanging over here in the air. Coming up - it's occupying my couch.
Okay.
Just leave the dark slide with it?
Well, I thought about ... the dark slide or something, and then I thought we might need it later for a magazine change; so, I left it with it.
Well, I know there's an orange dot on this ... somewhere. _page : 3
That looks just a couple of degrees still above the -
Buzz, did you ever get that camera?
Yes.
Okay.
Now, look.
Yes, I guess it's 5 minutes after you do this before ...
It's coming down, but it's - -
Is it?
- - as I said before, that's -
It looks like that's about equal to the limit pressure.
Yes, they're about - they're just about the same now.
Not getting much out of the radiator.
Okay, Buzz, are you ready for 16 millimeter?
Yes. How about a bracket?
Let - Neil will give you the bracket.
And the bracket - bracket slide -
Okay, Buzz, I'm going to have to do something about your couch. You mind sliding over to mine?
No, that's fine.
Could you - -
Can you work on that strap?
Oh, yes, I will. Sure will. The - the one that your strut's off ... instrument panel. _page : 4
Yes. ...
And your ...
That temperature's coming down a little bit now.
Yes.
Now, let's see. You got an 18 millimeter on here, right?
Yes.
So - Do I push the thing all the way up? Is that right?
Yes.
About with that white mark?
Yes, one's for the 18, and one's for the 75; I - I think just as long it looks like it's out and ... the window, that's the main thing.
Did you get a secondary radiator leak check?
Yes, we did that.
Okay. We're not hearing them, but we're ... Tananarive.
Are we on SIMPLEX A?
We're on SIMPLEX A.
We're on SIMPLEX A, but we're not due over Tananarive for another couple of seconds.
Okay.
What - ... time is 36 something - -
Am I set up on VHF? Can you tell ...?
Yes, just a second. Just a second - Your MASTER is ON; your INTERCOM is ON; your VHF is ON; your PAD COMM is OFF; your S-BAND is ON; and you're in INTERCOM/PUSH-TO-TALK, so you're all squared away, except for maybe VOLUME dial. _page : 5
Okay.
Now, Buzz, this item here at Canaries. LOS, 23:36; POTABLE WATER HEATER, MAIN A - -
Yes, I got that.
- - PCM BIT RATE, LOW - -
I got that.
- - You got all that, okay. Okay, when was the - -
And the purge check's complete, and I'm working my way down to ECS.
Okay.
I'm having a hell of a time maintaining my body position down here; I keep floating up.
Well, there's such a great tendency to - to try and put a little force ... want to stay there. Just forget about all that and go wherever you want.
Okay, I got the SYSTEMS TEST meter set up on 4-B and ... attitude ...
4-B, okay.
What are you reading?
I'm reading 3.50.
... our attitude quantities ...
Houston, Apollo 11.
Hello, Houston; Apollo ll.
OPTICS ZERO is OFF. I'm going to jettison the ... cover - -
Apollo 11, Apollo 11; this is Houston through Tananarive. Over. _page : 6
Hello, Houston; Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Houston. Apollo 11, read you on VHF A SIMPLEX. How do you read? Over.
Roger, 11; this is Houston. We're reading you loud and fairly clearly. For your information, Tananarive radar shows you in a 103.0 by 103.0 orbit. Over.
Beautiful.
We concur.
Well, we're just coming into the terminator, here.
I jettisoned the optics; I hope they went. Did you see them go?
I heard a little something, but I - -
Don't want to miss that.
No.
Can't really tell here. I think I'm seeing the horizon - out there, but I'm ... far from being dark-adapted; it's hard to tell -
... a double blind on this?
Yes. What were those Z-30 angles? 0.22, isn't it?
That's right, plus.
Sure's a big one, isn't it? Okay, well, I'm standing by to do this - -
Got A and B down.
- - IMU align. Unstow the optics handles. Anybody wants any of that claptrap out of R-1, now is the time to say it.
Give me that little circular Job. _page : 7
Alright, I'll - I'll look for it, Buzz. Let me get these - optics handles. I guess I really didn't mean what I said right when I said it a little while ... Oh, I knew there was something messed up.
You say you had about 3-point-something volts up there?
Yes. ... and on the ...
3.4?
3.45, something like that - -
Oh, that's - that's the minimum. 3.4, 4.1. And you can whip it over to 4-A, if - -
Okay, 4-A is 3.8. Okay.
No, 4-A.
4-A?
Yes.
And 3.8.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. 1 minute to LOS Tananarive; AOS Carnarvon is at 52:15. Over.
Apollo 11, Roger.
52:15.
You want some of these lights down further, Mark - Mike?
Don't worry about it for the time being; I'm potting around with handholds right now, Neil. ...
That battery compartment pressure, Mike, it ought to be less that 1.5. However, it says NA until first vent.
Okay.
It's greater than 1.5; that vent - vent - _page : 8
Well, we haven't even done it yet.
...
Yes.
Man, we are in the dark, now.
You got any reading off that REPRESS O2 to be greater than 8 ...
We got - No, not quite that much. That's that crazy gage.
Okay, can I have the ... now?
Yes, you got it. ... 50 degrees ...
... here is your acid test.
Okay, what did he say 52 -
52 ... percent, about.
As I say, I can't see ... Let me know if you want me to - come back ...
It's - Menkent.
... ball on that pad - it's maintaining about 39 degrees, Mike.
Yes, I noticed that. Before, it was maintaining less than that; it was abnormally low. I almost asked them about it during boost, and then I decided to heck with it. Damn, it'll be hard to see through these optics ... down a little bit. Okay, proceed to Menkent. There she goes - Menkent.
Menkent - God, what a star.
Nobody in their right - -
Menkent's good - -
- - nobody in their right mind would pick that one. _page : 9
- - Menkent's a good star.
Hey, I sure wish you'd get out that - that star chart.
Can't see a thing, huh?
No. It's in the - -
Did you look in the telescope?
- - in the sextant. Yes, but I can't see it in the telescope; in the sextant - I can't.
Okay.
I believe it's at the angle we have to mark on it.
It's a little on the chilly side in the cabin. Would you like - -
Feels comfortable to me.
- - would you like it a little warmer, anybody?
I don't think so; I think it's a little on the - -
...
It sure doesn't look - sure doesn't feel like - Actually, it may be a little - it may be a little warm.
Well, my - my feet are a little chilly; see, it's 47. Okay, 37 is - -
No, that's - -
- - is Nunki. What?
Okay. Hey, Buzz?
What?
Did you write down any marks on 30 and on 37?
I was going to mark on 37, and that's Nunki; 30 and 37? _page : 10
Yes, sir.
30 -
I can see some stars. Well, maybe I ...
Okay, again, looking through the telescope, I'm absolutely unable to tell if it's Nunki, but I have it in the sextant - so let's mark on it.
... you guys would appreciate doing this with old G&N men.
0.01.
0.01, alright. - Shoot, I forget, I think that's gray Gienah.
Cup of coffee around here later on when you get a little time.
You like that, Neil? You want us to record that star?
I got it, I got it; go ahead.
Let's see, what's tearing me up is we're going to ORB rate on this damn booster, and the rate is very evident.
Okay, Z torque is plus 0.152 instead of 150; I suppose that's close enough. Now then, you got those numbers written down, Buzz?
Copy.
Okay. Now I - I - If I remember right, I think you're just supposed to torque without further ado. We give them the time at which we torque. So, as soon as you got them written down, let me know and I'll proceed and you can mark the time.
I've got it.
Okay, here we go. Proceed - torque.
48:15. _page : 11
Okay, now I - I'm going to verify with the third star, and let's see what that star's going to be. Star number 34 - -
Atria - -
- - is Atria. You might note that, Buzz, also. I think - -
34?
Yes, I think that's the third star; it'll say somewhere in that checklist. Proceed to Atria. Alright, if IMU is realigned, realign the GDC.
0.1 degree. Probably GDC's off a lot more than that.
Okay, and Atria is there in the sextant. Well, you know, it's not right in the middle of the sextant. Of course, I guess - I don't know what - Have you ever heard any rules on what constitutes a good third star check?
No, all you're really doing is seeing that you've got the right stars, it seems to me.
It's there, but it's not dab-smack in the middle of the sextant; it's off, I would guess - 0.02 or some crazy number like that. Alright, having done that, VERB 37, ENTER; ... ENTER, and I'm going OPTICS ZERO and MANUAL, and cranking up the floodlights down here.
God, I'll tell you, the visibility through that telescope is a big disappointment.
It's ...
Okay, Buzz, got all that good stuff?
GDC's realigned, okay -
Reticle brightness ... I don't know anything about that. ... Stow optics eyepieces, okay, that's in work.
And ... out there right now. ... , Buzz? _page : 12
Neil, I haven't been looking out - My eyes aren't very well adapted.
You got your light on.
Yes, look at those bright ones down here.
Lightning! Is that lightning out your window?
No, I haven't seen any lightning.
Hell, that must be lightning. Either that or it's the ...
You know, no matter how many times I put these optics eyepieces - -
I just saw something. Maybe it is the ... They said that Borman's ... could see it; they couldn't hear it, but they could see it alright -
Yes.
No matter how many times I put these optics eyepieces in their box, it doesn't seem right.
0.01, God damn it! Now that's enough to piss a body off.
... that time.
S-band noise.
We're about to get - 10 seconds until acquisition.
Okay.
Okay, and my optics eyepieces are stowed.
You want me to take your checklist, Mike, and kind of skim through it?
It says here, coming up on Carnarvon LOS at - -
Let - let me tell them about the TV ... _page : 13
Roger, Bruce. Thank you. We expect TV. We've got it all hooked up. We have not yet turned it on; we're ready to do that now.
Okay, you think we can do that?
That's fine with us.
This one here?
Tell them that we've got nothing to do here but recheck it here for the next 20 minutes or so.
Okay. I'm ready to turn the TV on. Play with it. ... flashlight ... hook it up ...
Want a - ...? Mike?
No.
Yes, I'd love one, Neil; thank you. I just stuck it in my pocket.
Can I give you the wrapping back?
(Laughing) Now that is a problem, trying to find - -
It's a gooey one. Gooey when the paper doesn't want to come off, but thanks anyway.
What was you doing? (Laughter)
I don't know ... I almost lost it. I figured I'd really go along with the ... and put some of that ointment on - so slick that I rubbed my ring off (laughter).
Is that right?
Yes.
Have we got any daylight? I can't see outside at all.
Nothing yet, ...
How are you going to rig that up, Michael? _page : 14
Well, Buzz, I'm going to hold it out that hatch window.
Handhold it?
Yes - yes, yes, handhold it; don't dick with that.
Buzz can hold it, and you're going to run the monitor; have you run ...?
Yes.
Mike, how about this thing?
REPRESS - let's see, it's supposed to be - 865.
Go ahead.
And it - it kind of varies - not 865, but it's - 830.
...
Well, I don't know how - that ought to ...
I can turn - turn it on FILL for a minute, if you like. That's what we need to do, I think.
Maybe the ... this son of a bitch is working or not.
You got the power switches turned on up there at the - -
Yes. ...
Let's get into the Hasselblad ... get the right settings on it.
Okay.
Is Goldstone the only station that's going to get this?
Yes, that's all. That's the only one that's got a scanner converter. We've only got about 4 minutes, looks like. _page : 15
That must be doing something.
Yes.
How long - -
You got it on infinity for one thing; let me put it down here.
- - how long is it supposed to take to - -
...?
No, no, it's the one with the ...
Okay, it's - it's working somewhat; it's just the question of not enough light in here when I get it.
Yes.
... It's, I think, working okay.
We ought to be coming out into the daylight here in a little bit. Get it all shaped up?
I think it's fine. Now the one thing I forget about this is this zoom.
Do we want to write on this what - what we're taking pictures of? 0.5 millimeter.
Who knows about zoom lenses? This lens goes from 12.5 millimeters to 75; I assume that's the same nomenclature as on a camera. Right, 75 is zoom - -
I would think so.
- - and 12.5 is wide angle. The only thing that confuses me is that it says for vehicle to vehicle - We want to be zoom on 12.5. I guess they just want to make sure you got the other vehicle in view. Probably ... telephoto.
Okay, well, then, I'll put the zoom on 12.5.
Okay. You didn't touch this lighting? _page : 16
No, I didn't ... Minimum ...
I've got bright.
Focus, I'll put at infinity, and the f-stop for vehicle to vehicle is - -
Not much light in here.
- - f:2.8.
What?
Okay. I - I'll show what it looks like inside of the cabin.
Okay, this looks alright, I think.
Point that at Neil or point it at somebody who's in the light. Yes, we'll get it. ... You want to see the monitor?
...
Yes. You want to see the monitor?
Is this all ready to go; I'm going to put it back over here. It's over here under your stuff. Now, it seems to me if Buzz wants his camera to drift up, so what I ought to do is probably - Hey, Buzz.
Yes.
Hey, it seemed to stick pretty well if you stood it up on the - with the lens kind of pointing out. There are two pieces of Velcro over there.
Okay.
There are two pieces on the back of them ...
You think so, huh?
Yes, over, just a little up toward the ...
Now, ... - It's rolling around, so I can start looking outside, upside down. _page : 17
I don't know, I think we'd almost be better just by looking at the monitor, Buzz.
Yes, yes, but this way I think I'll know how to - know which way to move it.
Are you going the right way for those hoses? It looks to me like you ought to roll over the other way.
Hey, there's something. How's that window?
When you get around there, Buzz, I'll give you the briefing (laughter). You just slid out of your - -
I was out of my ...
Handkerchief or something - -
Where do we have to go to get a tissue?
All the way down to the ...
How about - using a piece of cloth, like - -
While I'm here, let me - -
What - what - do you want a tissue for?
Hey, that's a good idea. We can get rid of that stuff - -
...
- - that's a good idea; good head.
Brilliant ...
I got your checklist, Mike; you want it back?
Yes, I'll take it back, Neil - Thank you, just put it here.
No, you got Buzz's checklist here. You gave me BUZZ'S.
Excuse me. _page : 18
... I'd rather have my own.
How does the checklist look to you, Neil? You happy with it?
Yes, it looks fine to me.
Good.
I'll take your word for it, but the SPS and ECS and the EPS are now on ...
...
Yes, I'll do that. Are you ready for me to hand you your light test?
No, one-handed snap. ... I'm in the center now.
Okay, Buzz, the - -
Alright, I'll put yours on the left.
It doesn't matter, they're all good - far as I'm concerned, one's like another.
As a matter of fact, I'll put yours on the right.
Okay.
...
This 16-millimeter camera, Buzz, with the 18-millimeter lens - you got it shoved all the way up toward the window. I think we can - on this bracket.
Yes.
Okay, that was correct. You - you were asking about that.
And you have 6 frames per second, and it's color; you got 15 minutes worth - 6 frames a second, f:8, infinity, 1/250th.
Okay. The only question is, how much do we want to indicate on that? _page : 19
Outside of it - on the magazine?
Yes.
How does zero g feel? Your head feel funny, anybody, or anything like that?
No, I don't know, it just feels like we're going around upside down.
... I don't know - even feel that.
I feel the horizon coming up.
Oh, yes.
Buzz, are you ready to - -
... 90 degrees the wrong way - -
- - are you ready for this briefing? Buzz?
Yes, let me get this.
Oh! Okay.
Oh, yes, stand by for sunrise.
Say, we got the rookie with us; he hasn't seen so many of those.
(Laughter) Okay. 30 seconds.
Oh, no, there is a possibility.
We haven't got too many of them on this flight, so you might as well enjoy it while you can. Buzz, how are you doing?
Okay, go ahead and talk.
Okay, I'd like to show this to you while I'm talking. It works like a camera. It has the - The f-stop control is right here, and you set it on f:22 which, of course, lets in the smallest amount of light, and that's a safety precaution. Now, later you'll probably find that you want to go away from f:22. Okay? Under zoom - Your zoom control, can you see? The zoom is the middle one, and it's 12.5 millimeters on the middle one - See the 12.5 millimeters? That's the zoom.
Yes.
Focus is on infinity. You ought to just leave that on infinity; no doubt about that. Now, the zoom, they may want you to zoom in on the horizon a little bit, or the land or whatever. I'd start out with a wide angle at 12.5, and I'd start out with this on f:22 just for protection against getting too much light in. In all likelihood, you'll have to change that a little bit.
I think that - that's going to do it.
Yes, that looks good. I don't see how that can miss.
Jesus Christ, look at that horizon!
Isn't that something?
God damn, that's pretty; it's unreal.
Get a picture of that.
Ooh, sure, I will. I've lost a Hasselblad. ... Has anybody seen a Hasselblad floating by? It couldn't have gone very far - big son of a gun like that.
Now, what do we have - Is that all the -
You had the switch down - inside. ... automatic light control features.
Well, that pisses me off. Hasselblad gone. Find that mother before she or I ends the ... Everybody look for a floating Hasselblad. I see a pen floating loose down here, too. Is anybody missing a ballpoint pen?
Got mine. Is it ballpoint, or is it ...?
Yes, ballpoint. Here it is. I mean felt tip. _page : 21
... much embarrassed to say they've lost a Hasselblad. I seem to be prone to that.
And we're about 7 minutes away, so we got about 7 minutes of practice time.
I've looked - I've looked everywhere over here for that Hasselblad, and I just don't see it.
You can go to your ...
It's too late for sunrise, anyway.
I know, but I'm worried about - -
But you want to get it before TLI.
- - I know it. That's what I'm worried about.
Neil, could you look around over there?
Yes, I'll look.
I don't know if we want to go through any wild contortions looking for it - Do we have to throw some other switches?
No, the switches are all thrown.
... under you.
Buzz, you don't see the Hasselblad anywhere down below?
Let me go on a little expedition here. Has somebody ...?
I've looked already.
Ah! Here it is.
Find it?
Yes.
Beautiful.
It was floating in the aft bulkhead. _page : 22
On your side?
I got a way on it - of keeping it.
I got a little horizon. Man, look at that!
Looks like what you have to do to this, is not hold it against the window, because it's going to pick up - -
How's the monitor, working okay for you? Anything I can do to help?
...
I found a spot that really ... my window.
Yes, it looks like ... I got my - -
Trees and a forest down there; it looks like trees and a forest or something. Looks like snow and trees. Fantastic. I have no conception of where we're pointed or which way we're going or a crapping thing, but it's a beautiful low pressure cell out here.
Yes, go ahead and take a picture. Keep your ... down.
Beautiful low pressure.
Must be past Hawaii by now. 01:28 is AOS.
Buzz, how's it going there, the monitor giving you good service?
Not yet - flicking an awful lot.
Well, that's ... - It looks to me like you're home free. Just remember now, you're going to have to get that f-stop probably off 22, maybe not – focus stays on infinity and the zoom beats me. You can take your choice, you can zoom with that thing all the way in if you take it fairly slowly.
Sun is bright, isn't it? ... It's a pretty nice camera, to tell you the truth. _page : 23
I think you probably want sort of a wide angle - -
Yes, I think ... would be something ...
Well, if I take normal to the window, it's going to be ..., ...?
Yes, that would be pretty nice.
Getting a little of the rim there?
To get a little more view, you have to move down - away from -
Now, how we doing checklist-wise? Let's make sure we don't screw up and forget - -
I'm working on the attitude reference check right now.
Now, do we need to do anything else to configure this for ... receiver?
No, far as I know it's all up to them.
Oh, shoot; they're going to - Let's see, they're going to have to send us up a TLI pad, TLI abort, and a P37 pad. They're all right here in this little book; don't forget to remind me of that.
Okay, that's good.
How do you think we can ...?
Yes, you can fold it flat; would that help you?
Yes.
That's pull - pull - -
See that, Buzz? You're a TV expert.
Now, the next big thing we got to do is, after the attitude reference check, is extend the docking probe. No big thing. Copy down a bunch of pads and then you got your RCS hotfire.
That booster, when that thing - - _page : 24
Apollo 11, this is Houston through Guaymas. Over.
Roger, Houston. Reading you loud and clear.
Reading you the same. Coming up on AOS Goldstone.
Roger.
It should be right now, Buzz.
Cecil B. De Aldrin is standing by for instructions.
Houston. Roger.
Okay, and I got pads, need to extend the probe, and do an SM RCS hotfire.
That's right, that's the same way I read it. I don't know what this is, coming up.
When you - when you come up on this SECS LOGIC - and MSFN GO for pyro arm, don't forget to get an okay from them before you send the ... out.
Wow, I hope they get that; that's pretty.
With the sun glaring like it is, you're - you're correct on the f:22, I'm sure. It might be part of the - -
- - and the launch - vehicle guidance are both looking to be in good shape. We estimate you have better than a 99-percent probability of a guidance cut-off on the launch vehicle. So, things are apparently holding in very well. For your information, MLA received approximately 1 minute of a usable TV picture; so, apparently the system is working. You're a little over a minute from LOS at Canary; AOS Tananarive is 2 hours 9 minutes and 18 seconds. Over.
Roger. We like those 99 numbers. Thank you.
Roger. Out.
Okay. _page : 25
Now, let's see. We want to go to the suit circuit - -
Yes, I'll get the suit circuit if I can find that valve.
Okay, let's see, that's the EDS POWER, ON.
Oh, that thing is hard.
What - what do we want here - -
Suit's closed.
- - on that VERB 48?
Ready for EDS POWER, ON, you think?
EDS POWER, up and ON, yes.
Okay, it's ON.
EMS FUNCTION, OFF, verify.
EMS FUNCTION, OFF.
MODE, STANDBY - EMS MODE, STANDBY.
Okay, it's at STANDBY.
EMS FUNCTION, DELTA-V; set range VHF A.
Okay.
Set for 1586.8.
Okay.
Then go to NORMAL. Anybody know what we're doing with VERB 48 up there?
What are we supposed to be putting in there?
...
I wonder what the hell that is?
Just verify you got a 3 there? _page : 26
I guess so, that's what you need.
That's all you need.
Yes.
I don't know what that entry is in the checklist.
It doesn't matter what the other numbers are.
No, I mean any - any other weights or anything?
No.
Doesn't seem to me, for the pad we got, we – we want to load in any - -
No.
- - any of this - stuff. That's what we got in there, anyway.
Yes.
Maybe we can change the weight, but that's TLI plus 90; we got plenty of time.
We don't want to do that.
No.
It's almost the same anyway.
It's about the same anyway, yes.
Okay. You ready for the - your EMS MODE, NORMAL?
NORMAL.
EMS FUNCTION to DELTA-V TEST.
That's good; that light enough.
...
Now, we want a GDC align.
Yes. _page : 27
Now, let's see - -
Minus 19.9.
That's alright - minus 0.1 to - can you write that one down?
It's real close.
Yes.
That's just about perfect.
Alright. EMS MODE, STANDBY.
STANDBY.
And EMS FUNCTION, DELTA-V, set. Set DELTA-VC. You got the number?
Yes. 10 4256.
4256? How about 4356?
That's right, 4356.
And how about ORDEAL? Does that go back, Buzz?
Yes.
I guess we got all of those -
Where did all those numbers come from?
Yes; much better.
They give us a new state vector?
Yes.
Yes, they did.
They did, yes.
No, that's VERB 66. ... apogee - perigee.
I'll just put a question mark here about - not show our ignorance. _page : 28
Well, looks like we're picking up a little. That sound reasonable? 1166?
... the time, is that right?
The S-IVB?
Yes, you add about 4 or 5 miles to your orbit - apogee - perigee.
Yes.
Yes, that's too much.
We're up to 6 ...
That thing ... now, that may not be now; that may be at TLI.
I don't have any reason not to believe it.
No.
If it isn't any good, we'll need another one anyway, huh? So, there isn't any point in saving the other one.
Okay.
VERB 66.
Okay. 10 435.6.
10 435.6. Alright, go to EMS FUNCTION, DELTA-V.
DELTA-V.
GDC align is at - What's this "D"?
Huh?
That means ...
Oh.
Won't get them on S-band.
S what? _page : 29
VHF.
Okay. A SIMPLEX, it should be on.
Set ORDEAL? Do something with it, anyway.
Let's see, ORDEAL is - -
What happened to that card that was here?
I already fired it.
What was that?
Um hum.
Saturn boost? This was a boost card.
Okay.
You can't have that.
You don't want that one, do you?
No.
Trade it - for a good one.
How about some LM pointing angles?
Okay, let's do one more. We're going first opportunity, you think?
Burn time is 05 plus 47.
Yes.
And emergency shutdown, Neil, is plus 10 seconds; 10 minus 40 on the DELTA-VC, is that right?
Plus 6 seconds - plus 6.
And - no - no, I'm sure about that minus.
No, no, it's not; it's only ...
No, it's plus 6 seconds and VI on the DSKY at G&N. _page : 30
I think that's going to show up here, isn't it?
What?
TLI?
The roll?
Burn ...
They're in the damn flight plan; I don't think they're in the checklist.
Alright. You got ORDEAL set in some way?
ORDEAL is okay.
Well, do you want to get ahead on a few things?
Well, give me an example.
We don't need the sequence pyro arm yet, huh?
No. Don't want to do that until -
TRANS CONTROL POWER, ON?
It's ON.
ROT CONTROL POWER, NORMAL, two of them, AC/DC?
There you go.
DIRECT, two, MAIN A/MAIN B?
Okay.
LAUNCH VEHICLE indicators: GPI to S-II/S-IVB. GUIDANCE to IU.
That IU?
Yes.
Have we got pyros armed?
No. _page : 31
No.
Okay.
CB, DIRECT ULLAGE, two of them, CLOSED.
Better wait awhile on that.
Okay, how about cranking the event timer to 51:00, then?
What's burn time? Ignition time? 2 what?
35, 30 minutes.
Well, that's going to be ...
Okay, I'll set up the event timer.
Burn time is 05:20.
DELTA-VI - going to be ...
Sure you got - you got your checklist here, haven't you? Yes.
Yes, they put all this TLI crap in my checklist; even though I took it out, they put it back in.
Well, Mattingly assured me that I was going to have a circular velocity versus altitude, you know, when they get me at 100 miles on the other side?
It's not in here, either, I looked.
Where would it be? It'd be right in here -
I finally gave it to ...
Hey, that's - you know what the numbers are, roughly.
25 - 25 550 at a 100 miles - something like that, it changes, probably - -
Yes, but this was to be - What do you have on this side to give you that on the other side? _page : 32
I'm running a little bit on the warm side; how are you guys ... along?
Probably a tad on the warm side.
Suit and cabin pressures both look - I guess we should be cool.
Should be about 100 ... - okay -
Water - boiling - ... potable ...
Fuel cells ... water. It goes to potable tank first and then we - we get it.
Oh - stop there?
Yes.
Coming into the terminator.
Gee, I'm really disappointed over those optics; that telescope is horrible. Maybe it'll get better with practice - or adaptation, or what have you.
Gee, I almost went to sleep then.
Me, too; I'm taking a little rest.
It's going to be a long day.
How'd the - is this the first part of the attitude comparison check or the second part?
I haven't done the second GDC align yet; it comes up on the next page. About now, I guess.
Well, we should have Tananarive. How about going - pressing ahead with the sequence pyro arm?
Okay, let me align the GDC.
Well, they cleverly do this on - just on opposite sides of the world so you always have to pitch - run all the thumbwheels the maximum amount. _page : 33
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston standing by through Tananarive. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Roger.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear.
You get the pyro armed?
No, I haven't. Just a second, I'll be right with you.
Get 51 on the event timer?
We stopped boiling water.
That's good.
Old son of a gun.
Okay on the temperatures.
Looks like the setting on the AUTO thing is such that it just runs a little cold.
Yes, that's right. That's - that's what I think, too.
... have a feeling I have a ball in here.
Okay, the GDC is - is aligned. Ready to proceed.
Okay. We've got the VERB 48 in, VERB 83, ORDEAL set, and SEQUENCE PYRO ARM.
Okay. Stand by for a blast. One's ON. Two's ON.
Houston, Apollo 11. We have the pyros armed.
Okay.
This is Houston. Roger; out.
TRANS CONTROL POWER's ON. ROT CONTROL POWER, NORMAL, two, AC/DC.
They're all up. _page : 34
DIRECT? MAIN A/MAIN B.
DIRECT.
S-II/S-IVB.
Check.
GUIDANCE, IU?
IU, yes.
Circuit breakers, DIRECT ULLAGE, two, CLOSED.
Okay.
And the event timer's set.
Now, why don't you - why don't you put ORDEAL on 200/LUNAR?
Alright.
Maybe you can start figuring out what the hell that ought to be.
I guess - leave them on INERTIAL for the time being.
Beyond my ability to - compute here right now.
...?
You're not worried now on that thing.
When the motor lights up, he's worried.
... 190, 110 degrees.
Got a long way around, yet.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. 1 minute to LOS Tananarive; AOS at Carnarvon, 02:25:30.
Roger.
02:25:30.
Yes. 02:25. ... _page : 35
Why did they do that? That should be up here, before 02:35.
I don't know. It's screwed up in here anyway.
Well, weren't they giving us two abort pads before?
No, TLI plus 90 and TLI plus 4 hours. And now the TLI plus 4 hours is TLI plus 5 hours, P37.
Oh, is that right?
Yes. Got them on the same page.
Yes, they're on the same page.
Yes, I was expecting them to get something in.
Going to have to break your ... here, I mean - your LMP handhold.
Oh, my G&N handhold; don't do that. ... managed to hang on to it, ... up there.
Holding against the ... - the couch.
Well, let's see ...
Think I was that slow punching the clock?
Huh?
I wonder if I was that slow getting everything going? I ought to have given them a second or ...
It didn't seem to me as though there was a tremendous cue; there's no doubt that you were moving, but to say exactly what the precise time was when you started to move, I think you'd call it whenever the thing started vibrating.
Yes, I didn't know when the hell we were airborne; I just took his word for it. It was sure shaking, rattling, and rolling, son of a bitch!
Wake me up at TLI, somebody.
Another 15 minutes, just time to sleep. _page : 36
You need to get out the alarm clock.
I don't know, I think I'll just put my window guard up.
Yes.
Whopseedoo, we picked up an S-band. No noise.
What's VERB 85 going to tell me - if I call that up, Mike?
It tells you range - range rate in C, which is the angle between your - optics line of sight and the horizon, depending on what - -
What's that little bump in the ... somebody?
That's me; I - I'm thrashing around over here a little bit.
I - if you wonder, I stuffed my launch checklist and - in the little gap between the -
You don't have a launch checklist.
My cue card.
Oh.
In between the - the Y-Y strut and the wall over here, to keep it from bouncing around.
Oh.
...
Yes, that says 58-1/2 degrees, huh?
Yes.
... 57-1/2 isn't that something like that? Now wait a minute.
Yes, 57-1/2 degrees.
I guess they're ... about on the horizon anyway. Yes, okay. _page : 37
Huh?
Buzz, I put 39.5 volts over here; that's a reminder on the battery check - real good on the wall. Okay, Neil, now TLI - I'm going to write on the wall here - TLI - nominal is 05 plus 47; and 6 seconds later, it's 05 plus 53. And you want me to let you know when that is; I'll yell "cut-off" at that time.
Okay.
Now, we want to get what that time's going to be up there. Is that alright, Neil?
Yes, that's right. 05:53, I want it yelled.
Okay. I'll yell "cut-off," huh?
Yes, I guess. And I'll cut off if the G&N says - -
Agreed.
- - we're overburned.
That's right.
You got that TRANSLUNAR switched to INJECT, huh?
Yes, to INJECT.
EDS POWER, you got ON?
EDS POWER is ON.
PYROs are ARMED?
PYROs are - four breakers are in, and switches are up.
Okay, on this thing here, we should be reading 02:41:01, shutdown, and - -
Add 6 seconds to it?
Yes. At 07, cut-off.
BLOCK, BLOCK. SPACECRAFT CONTROL to SCS? _page : 38
It is.
Tank pressures looking alright?
Tank pressures are looking good.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Slightly less than 1 minute to ignition, and everything is GO.
Okay, 59:25 - and this light will go off at 42 -
Time is based on tracking data; let me know when you start it up.
Okay.
When you feel it, that's when it is.
Okay, this light is out - know any of it any more.
Okay, we're operate - 59:59.
There we go; thrust.
IGNITION. Call it at 15.
Okay.
Whew!
We confirm ignition, and the thrust is GO.
Pressures look good.
Flashes out window number 5.
...
I'm not sure whether that's - it could be lightning, or it could be something to do with the engine -
Continual flashes ...
About 2 degrees off in the pitch ...
Yes, wouldn't worry too much about that. _page : 39
Apollo 11, this is Houston. At 1 minute, trajectory and guidance look good, and the stage is good. Over.
Apollo 11. Roger.
Don't look out window 1. If you're - if it looks like what I see out window 5, you don't want to look at it (laughter).
I don't see anything.
Why?
These flashes out here - -
Oh, I see a little flashing out there, yes.
You see that? Buzz is usually looking – just watch window 5 for a second. See it?
Yes, yes. Damn, everything's - just kind of sparks flying out there.
Yes, that's - Oopsedo.
Man, that really - -
That's PU shift?
I don't know, but it sure put a little blip in there at 2 minutes; I think it increased in thrust.
Think it's the PU shift?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Thrust is good; everything's still looking good.
That's about like a pitch change rather than an acceleration increase. Did it feel that way to you?
Okay. We got a lighted horizon at 2-1/2 minutes. Pretty horizon.
A fairly smooth ride, you know; it's just a little tiny bit rattly, but nothing like Stafford's – H-dot looks great. Don't bet you could do any better. _page : 40
I'm sure I couldn't. I'd do worse because I'd be a - a full degree off from where it is right now.
Don't sweat that. 3 minutes.
3 minutes. What we got, about one g, Neil?
Pressures are good - -
Yes, we've got 3 feet per second - -
Just under one g.
Mike, we're within 3 feet per second on the card H-dot.
Fantastic. And it's shaking everything a little bit.
Shaking at 3 minutes.
Okay.
I hope that camera doesn't fall on your face.
I checked it; it's locked in there pretty well. Won't hurt this visor -
03:30 coming up - Should be 5.5, and it is 5.5.
Nice ride.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. At 3-1/2 minutes, you're still looking good. Your predicted cut-off is right on the nominal.
Roger. Apollo 11's GO.
I see a bright star out there, must be Venus. Forgot to memorize John Mayer's views out the window well enough to say that's Venus or not, but it's sure bright.
What would you do about it?
Nothing.
4 minutes – _page : 41
Tell you what - that's Venus.
10 feet per second off on H-dot -
..., that's about where it is.
Here comes the old sun.
Gee, that's going to be bright.
Glad I got my card up.
I'm glad you had - you do too, Neil; that was a good idea, a hell of a good idea. I can't see - well, my tapes are ... I can't ... see very much.
Coming up on 04:30. How you look, Buzz?
Looks good. Oh, about 14 feet per second right now. The altitude's very good. We ought to get a real good 5-minute cut at the ...
You guys agree with my mark; we'll be 5 minutes?
Okay.
Just a second.
5 minutes.
MARK.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are GO at 5 minutes.
Roger. We're GO.
Okay, we're just a little bit low on time.
Right on it.
... yaw.
... do that?
Yes, we better do that.
5 - 5 seconds – _page : 42
What kind of g we pulling?
We got a 1.2 or 3 - 1.3, maybe.
Gee, feels a lot more than that already.
Okay, 6 - okay, about 5 seconds to nominal.
We have cut-off.
3.3 on the DELTA - -
The DELTA-VC on the EMS: 3.3.
Beautiful. EMS FUNCTION, OFF.
OFF.
SECS PYRO ARM, two, SAFE.
I got out - I got out of kilter here; let's go back and let Buzz pick up on it. You're just a little bit ahead of yourself on the checklist.
Okay.
Okay, Houston, you read 11?
Buzz, forget I read anything in the checklist.
Yes - -
Not getting any answer -
Okay, let's go to IU ACCEPT here. Now, ...
Why don't you try to get up high - -
SCS TVC SERVO POWER 1, OFF.
Okay.
You want to get Houston on the radio if you can?
Yes. _page : 43
PCM BIT RATE, LOW.
PCM BIT RATE is LOW - -
- - two, ARMED.
Two, ARMED.
CMC MODE, AUTO.
AUTO.
Start the digital event timer.
Okay, start.
And we're going to translate plus X and hold.
Yes.
CM/LAUNCH VEHICLE SEP pushbutton?
Yes.
Watch the tank pressure and the engine light.
Are you on tank pressures? You are.
And you're going to go to 100.8?
Yes.
You want to -
Here we go.
Okay, Houston; we're about to SEP.
Thrusting -
This is Houston. We copy.
SEP.
Look at that trash.
SEP complete. _page : 44
Got DELTA-V?
Okay, got 0.7; I'm going to stop there and - -
... go to RELEASE; DELTA-V indicator minus 100.8 - -
Okay.
- - SERVICE MODULE RCS PROPELLANT, verify eight of them gray.
Okay, you got problems there. Get the ... – there you go.
I'll get them.
Okay, okay.
What else? Did - -
CM - -
PRIMARY and SECONDARY PROPELLANT B went barber pole at SEP.
That was SECONDARY PROPELLANT on quad - quad Bravo?
Quad Bravo, yes; both the PRIMARY and SECONDARY talkbacks went barber pole.
..., three, OPEN.
Okay, your - -
Roger; we copy.
- - ... This is the one that ... 0.5, right? Is it - Mike, you key a VERB 62?
Yes.
PROCEED and you're pitching?
She's pitching.
Trying - to turn itself off again; look at this.
Is it holding it this time? _page : 45
Watch, it'll probably go back to RATE COMMAND.
That slows it down?
... keeps pitching.
Your MAN ATT, PITCH, to ACCEL COMMAND?
It went to RATE - Okay, I see a SLA panel going out.
Okay, you got to get a pitch rate in there -
See that SLA panel?
Is it flying - yet?
It's alright. She's darn well unbelievable - something.
I see it ...
Do I need some circuit breaker in to get - -
I see another - No, that's alright.
- - to get this camera going? Mike?
No, you need the power on over there, though.
I turned it on.
I got it. ... beautiful.
You sure you have the right power switch on?
Boy, that's - -
Yes.
You got him?
No, I don't.
To the right over here.
Can you see him? _page : 46
No, I don't see - -
He's a little bit to our right.
Okay, I see him.
We need about a 5-degree right, and we need to stop our - -
Okay. We'll stop here.
- - ... and we're pretty far away from him, too.
Okay, watch it, we should be stopping here.
How long do we want to run this film?
How does he look, Mike?
He's - he's fine.
Okay, you got 100.4 now.
Yes, I know; those numbers don't mean anything. They were 99-something when we turned around; don't ask me why. I thrusted toward him quite a bit, and I don't know why those numbers were screwed up, but they were.
Buzz, how does he look to you; looks like he's getting closer to me.
... get the BMAG?
Okay.
Yes, it looks like he's drifting down just a tad, and he's supposed to be.
How are our eight gray talkbacks; they still good?
Very good.
Flies like a spacecraft instead of a simulator. Hope that's good.
Sure beautiful. I hope you got some pictures, Buzz. _page : 47
I got the 16 millimeter going - -
Is it going?
- - 16 frames at f:8 - -
Good.
- - 70, 1/250th, ...
Beautiful.
It really looks nice, doesn't it?
Hey, we're closing in a leisurely fashion.
Hey, how long does this ...?
It's on the - it's printed - -
Yes.
- - yes, it's six frames at 15; I suggest toward the end you probably goose it up a little bit.
You want to get the whole thing?
I don't care - ... tell by looking at ...
The thing is, with this sitting there, I can't get much with the Hasselblad. That window's no good, I'm afraid.
Can I hold something for you?
Take a couple of ...
Yes, you might look - if you're looking for something to do, you might just look over my panel 1 and 8 and all that and make sure all the switches are - to your liking.
I'll do it.
...
Be sure that your RCS is working anyway. _page : 48
How far out are you, Mike?
I'm still quite a ways. That's definitely a SLA panel - there's no doubt about that. Sure looks like ... panel. That stuff's hitting from the S-IVB from us. Gees, look it - that one thing just hit the - gyro package on the S-band antenna.
Yes, things occasionally come scooting out.
...
And, occasionally, you know, a little piece of something hits the - what do you call that - covering? The whole LM quivers every so often. All - all the surface of it, Neil, you know, just kind of shakes like that.
Yes?
Just in one spot; it's not being hit. I hope it doesn't come in ... - -
Stand by; we're getting pretty close.
Just from the APS firing, you think?
Stand by; we're closing.
Okay - -
We don't have too much - -
- - BMAG MODE, three - You should stabilize and align CM - BMAG MODE, three, to ATT 1/RATE 2?
Okay.
And we're - translated plus X. That CAPTURE PROBE, EXTEND/RELEASE, you've done that; CMC MODE, FREE?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Allow probe to damp spacecraft oscillations?
We did that. _page : 49
Yes, you've done that. DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, PRIMARY 1?
We did that.
Alright, after dock - -
- - EXTEND/RELEASE, to OFF?
DOCKING PROBE, EXTEND/RELEASE, to OFF, I did that. DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, ... to OFF.
Okay, DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, two of them, OFF?
No, no, wait a minute. It says "DOCKING PROBE, EXTEND/RELEASE, to OFF," huh?
Yes.
Okay.
Alright, let's go. DOCKING PROBE, RETRACT, two of them, OFF?
Alright. Circuit breakers: DOCKING PROBE, two, OPEN.
DOCKING PROBE, two, OPEN.
Okay, PCM BIT RATE is LOW. Postdocking: it says RATE, HIGH; ATT DEADBAND, MAX.
RATE, HIGH; ATT DEADBAND, MAX.
COAS POWER, OFF.
COAS POWER, OFF.
... get this to stop ...
Yes, that wasn't the smoothest docking I've ever done.
Well, it felt good from here. _page : 50
I mean the - I mean the whole - I mean the gas consumption would be a lot more than I would have guessed, you know? I thought I could about equal the simulator in ... and I didn't - I bet you I used - I hate to quote a number, but I've been down around 30-some pounds in the simulator, and I'll bet this was 50, 60 pounds, something like that. Hate to quote a number.
How do the - Speaking of that, how do the service module RCS quantities look?
Well, Buzz is fooling around with that - Let me just - -
They - they're all 90 except B, which is above 90.
Should be. Can't ever tell on 3 -
No, C and D are ... 3, anyway.
Okay -
Well, I got to go in there and dick - -
I'm not sure that we're getting - -
Well, Buzz is getting COMM right now.
Yes, let Buzz do his high-gain thing, and I'll get ready to go dick with the tunnel.
Sure is squiggly, isn't it? It really wanders all over, doesn't it?
Neil, where do you put this guy - usually?
I - clip it to that - clip up there beside the COAS - you see - -
Okay.
- - see those clips up there, one of those. It's got a snap right here that's pretty good.
I think I can get it now - ...
Okay, Buzz, how am I doing on the checklist? _page : 51
Well, I'm trying to - -
You're at the high gain - -
- - you're at postdocking; I'm trying to get the high gain going - and I'm having a little trouble - ... trouble.
That's MANUAL -
Whatever you do, take some pictures.
That should be on wide beam or ...?
Wide.
Okay.
Hey, if you're through there, give me that VERB 64.
What? Okay.
I'm amazed how it just wanders around for a given setting; you notice that?
There - it sounds like we got it now. There's your VERB 64.
We got signal strength.
Okay. You have to really be on MANUAL for those things to be indicating correctly.
He was but - -
Okay.
- - this one was just kind of wandering around there - with no - -
As soon as I went down to HIGH GAIN was when the signal strength came up.
Okay, ... man.
Apollo 11 - - _page : 52
...
Optics ... are up?
Yes.
Okay, 41:23; 1 minute to LOS. Mark that.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. ...
Roger. Everything looks okay up here.
How much time have we got, Mike?
9 minutes.
Well, let's let them look at the main bus ties coming on, alright?
Sure.
What time is it?
8-1/2 minutes.
How soon are we going to - -
... take 2.
1 second early. Okay. MAIN BUS TIES - -
Okay.
I'm going to turn my S-BAND VOLUME down, so you can ...

MARK it -
6-1/2.
10-minutes difference whether we ..., huh? That's a lot of time.
Yes. _page : 54
Now, what do we do? Turn up - Where did the noise come from?
VHF or the S-band?
I don't know.
VHF, I think. It's a woo-woo noise.
Woo-oo, what time is it?
I turned my S-BAND VOLUME down to get rid of that background noise; now don't forget for us to turn it back up on the other side.
What time you got?
It's coming up on 5 minutes to TIG; I'll give you a mark.
Alright. Start giving me PITCH 1, YAW 1.
Okay, here comes PITCH 1.
Got it.
Here comes YAW 1.
Got it.
MARK -

Okay. Now you got an option of trimming or bypassing.
Let's bypass. _page : 56
Alright. BMAG MODE, three, to ATT 1/RATE 2.
Okay, we're going to - Did you say after ENTER?
Before ENTER.
Okay, ATT 1/RATE 2; BMAG's in shape.

Alright.
Stand by for 2 minutes; then we'll have DELTA-V THRUST B, ON, okay?
That's right. Guess we want to turn it on at 2 minutes - Want to wait awhile?
You already asked them that and they said turn it on at 2 minutes. _page : 57
I never saw any lights, so they never saw a signal so everything looks good. Put it on 2 minutes and be ready to turn it off.
Okay. I'll be ready. Coming up on 2 minutes.
MARK -
Go on, nothing happened.
TRANSLATION CONTROLLER, ARMED.
Okay.
ROTATION CONTROLLER, ARMED.
Okay.
TAPE RECORDER ... RESET it - -
...
Tape recorder's running, right?
Tape recorder is running. You verify the EMS set up to 81, is it, huh?
Yes, I got to go to horizontal at 35.
...
- - 35, 30 seconds, yes.
I'll proceed on the 99.
Alright. 60 -
You're going to watch the - go gray - -
Right.
- - and the ball valve.
Right.
35 seconds; DSKY's blank, EMS MODE, NORMAL. Okay. _page : 58
Yes, the moon is there, boy - in all its splendor.
Man, it's a - -
Plaster of paris gray to me.
Man, look at it.
Don't look at it; here we come up - -
Okay.
- - ... to TIG.
8 seconds.
99 -
Stand by for TIG.
Got B mode - -
Burning; we're looking good.
- - A, here comes B - B, I mean, THRUST A -
MARK.
Got them.
Got them both? Okay, now what's your - read your chamber pressure?
It's good. 95, 95.
PUGS is oscillating around. Okay, we're steering.
95 seconds in, it says go DECREASE, and we're ...
You're in pretty good; your gimbals are working a little bit more busily than I would have guessed, but everything's looking good.
EMS and G&N CALS together. _page : 59
Okay.
Pitch trim is up at 1.5 degrees, cycling about that, which is a little bit off the SIM value. Yaw trim is cycling about zero. Chamber pressure - -
...
- - is 95.
Right, going INCREASE.
Yes, you're into - a minute into it. Yes.
Well, it's still below zero, I just - -
I'll bet you we're never going to catch up. Let's do it and see what happens.
Okay, that should be gray -
g feels sort of pleasant, doesn't it? We're measuring just a shadow over zero g on the g-meter.
Tank pressures are good.
Okay. The chamber pressure is holding steady as a rock. It's holding - it's building up a little bit, actually; it's up around 96 now. Gimbals are sure a little bit busier than I would have guessed.
That's a little more chamber pressure than they were predicting.
Yes, they're all plus 95.
We may - -
Shut down a little early.
- - shut down a little early.
What do you think about this crazy g-scale?
All your ... look okay over there, Buzz? _page : 60
Man, I'm not going to look at them.
Alright, probably a good rule.
How about that? It's running a couple up.
35 more seconds, and we'll be out of mode 2.
Well, it's more than just - -
Chamber pressure continuing; it's up to about 97 - 98 percent.
- - more than just gray.
Yes, there's a little pinging in there. That might have jammed; keep your arms off the cockpit, ... all day to look at that thing.
Look at that thing; that's just where I want it. What do you think about that? A tad low. We're not going to - match it - ... creep up. Okay? Pressure is on INCREASE - -
Tank pressures are still good.
- - ... at the beginning.
Chamber pressure - -
Take a look at this.
- - is holding. Wandering off a little bit in roll; that's to be expected. Coming back.
Okay - -
We're well into mode 3.
- - it's going to be about 3 seconds early - cutoff.
Alright, cut-off nominal at 06:02; expect cut-off around 6 minutes even then, huh?
... _page : 61
Okay, the rates. We're ... all three axes are about 0.1 degree per second. APS is punting back and forth.
I'm predicting 05:58.
Okay.
4 seconds early.
Right now.
May be - might be 5 by the time I get my ...
Okay, she's steering like a champ; chamber pressure sneaking up to 100.
Look at the ...
..., didn't recognize it ....
Pitch trim is holding a little over 2; it's oscillating between 2 and 2.4, roughly. Yaw trim is oscillating between minus 0.5 and zero. It's just sort of aimlessly wandering back and forth between those values. Rates are still wandering; they're deadbanding the rates in all three axes; they're plus or minus 0.1 a degree.
We're now predicting 5 seconds early, 05:57.
Chamber pressure is 100 psi even.
Ball number 1 and ball number 2 both right on value. Roll zero, pitch 225, roughly, and yaw 348; and hold.
Okay, going to get the DELTA-V switches OFF right at shutdown?
Shutdown, I'll get both DELTA-V THRUST, NORMAL switches, OFF.
10 seconds.
Okay. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, - -
... _page : 62
SHUTDOWN.
Okay, now.
Ball valves closed - -
50 seconds.

Okay.
All four. Standing by for the gimbal motors.
Alright. PITCH 1 - OFF.
Got it.
YAW 1, OFF.
Got it.
PITCH 2, OFF.
Got it.
YAW 2, OFF.
Got it.
Okay. TVC SERVO POWER 1 and 2, OFF.

MAIN BUS TIE is OFF.
Okay.

Man, man!
Alright.
Understand.
Look at the residuals. PROCEED. _page : 63
PROCEED? Copy them down; we're not going to trim them.
...
... minus 1, minus 1, plus 1. Jesus!
Got them.
I take back any bad things I ever said about M.I.T. - which I never have.
Okay, will you just leave them, now? They vary around.
Alright, get the EMS, too.
Okay, EMS says minus 6.8.
Got it. You got them on the ... switches?
Minus 6.8 to the DELTA-V to B.
... flight plan.
Alright, no nulling residuals. EMS FUNCTION to OFF, we got that ...?
1 minute - Neil's got it. We got it, minus 6.8. Okay, stand by on OFF on EMS. What else you got, Buzz, in the way of a checklist?
The EMS MODE, STANDBY?
STANDBY.
BMAG MODE, three, to RATE 2?
Three to RATE 2.
ATT DEADBAND, MAX?
ATT DEADBAND, MAX.
PCM BIT RATE, LOW?

Circuit breakers - PITCH 1, PITCH 2, YAW 1, YAW 2, OPEN.
PITCH 1, PITCH 2, YAW 1, YAW 2, OPEN. Proceed.
Okay, proceed. Okay, VERB 82 in there. Go to P00. Well, that isn't what it says, but -
Well, it's good.
I think we're going to have to - Well, we'll leave this here anyway ... magazine ...
What goes in this VGX column?
That was the - that's the VGX residual at – before you spin.
Okay.
So just read the ... A.
Alright.
That was a beautiful burn.
God damn, I guess.
Whoo! Well, I have to vote with the 10 crew, that thing is brown.
Yes.
Sure is.
Looks tan to me.
But when I first saw it, at the other sun angle - -
Yes?
It looked gray.
- - it really looked gray. _page : 65
Yes.
More - more sun angle you get - -
It got more - more brown - with increasing sun angle.
Okay.
It's a long ways off.
Alright, let's - Okay, now we've got some things to do -
Okay, let's do them.
We got to do a VERB 66.
Hey, wait a minute - alright.
Buzz will want to do a VERB 82; now, I don't know what comes first here.
Yes, VERB 82.
Well, I don't know if we're 60 miles or not, but at least we haven't hit that mother.
Look at that! Look at that! 169.6 by 60.9.
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful!
What - what'd it say - -
You want to write that down or something?
- - 60.2.
Write it down just for the hell of it. 170 by 60, like gangbusters.
We only missed by a couple of tenths of a mile.
Hello, Moon; how's the old back side?
Well, it's - -
VERB 66, alright? _page : 66
VERB 66.
We won't need that other vector ever again.
Now, we're - PCM, LOW, and we want to turn the TAPE RECORDER, OFF?
Yes, why - I don't care.
Okay.
Why don't you go PCM, LOW, and don't worry about the tape recorder; it's got 2 hours.
Okay.
Okay, we'll look at service module RCS - and SCS -
I want to look at the DAP again and enter a VERB 48, ENTER.
What was our ...?
1500.
Okay.
You got all your things logged now?
Yes, sir, I'm all logged.
Okay.
Now, it says what we do is roll 180 and pitch down 70.
That do it? Alrighty, let's go to SCS and do it.
And -
Don't waste all the gas, now.
... When I get around there, I'll pitch down 70, huh? What are we pitching down for, what, what, what - -
We're going to - what we're - - _page : 67
I don't even know what we're doing.
Well, we're going to roll over and pitch down so we're looking out the front windows, down at the - -
Oh, yes, okay.
Okay?
We can pitch down - ... picture - -
... - -
- - can we take a picture - -
- - ... pitch attitude.
Yes.
Now, we're going to have high gain, and then we're - -
How would you - -
- - going to be able to - -
- - like it with the - -
- - look at the moon ahead of us, coming out the window right now.
Can we see the earth horizon from here?
Well, we ... - -
We should be able to ...
- - ... precise. What was the time we got on it, Neil?
Yes, we can - -
Neil?
What's that? _page : 68
What was the time we got on it?
Burn time?
No, no - -
Burn time or what?
We want the big camera, huh? Big lens or small one?
Oh, it doesn't really matter.
80 millimeter will probably be as good for - -
For the earth coming up?
No, for the earth - -
No, for the earth coming up, we want 250. Might take some - -
- - not sure we can get the earth coming up - -
- - might take some - some luck to get that, but - -
Here, you want -
Tape recorder still running?
Yes.
It doesn't matter, we've got 2 hours on that tape, and they don't care if you run out. As long as you're on BIT RATE, LOW.
Okay, infinity, at f:11 - and 1/250th, huh?
Okay, let me get my - let me get my gouge out here. I got my gouge - -
You might want to back off a half stop to get the earth -
Are you - you black and white or color?
Color. _page : 69
Alrighty.
Moon ..., 5.6; earth ..., 11; ... terminator, 1.8 - -
You think it's on your - your spotmeter reading for the earth?
Which way are you maneuvering now, friend?
5.6 at - 5.6 at 1/250th is probably - -
Are you rolling?
Rolling?
You are, aren't you?
I'm rolling right.
Boy, they rate some rough country over there.
You might get it coming sideways here; stand by in case it does. What's the AOS time?
It was 15 with the burn. 15:23, something like that.
Just be with you in 10 seconds, Neil; I just want to get my - -
We ought to be able to get it - -
- - book put back together here.
- - a couple of good shots.
The earth's going to be over here?
AOS, 76:15. That's exact - -
Can you verify that you got the state vectors transferred with the VERB 83?
I'll do that.
Now, what else we got? _page : 70
Coming up there.
... Eyeballing and chattering. We got the burn status report? That's all?
Ready to go.
Okay, that looks good. Give me a VERB - 64.
What happened?
Ought to wash this window over here - -
You have a map so we can look at ...
Anybody got a - -
Yes, it - -
- - anybody got a Kleenex?
Yes, I think I've got one. Here you go.
Here's one; it's a little moist, though.
...
Well, one more ... burn.
Two more.
You got two more.
Yes, ... got a few more.
Look at those craters in a row. You see them right - going right out there?
...
Look at that line of them.
...
... _page : 71
Something really peppered that one. There's a lot less variation in color than I would have thought, you know, looking down?
Yes, but when you look down, you say it's brownish color?
Sure.
Oh, golly, let me have that camera back. There's a huge, magnificent crater over here. I wish we had the other lens on, but God, that's a big beauty. You want to look at that guy, Neil?
Yes, I see him.
He's coming your way.
That dark spot.
Oh, let me - here, let me - -
Well, there's no doubt that this is a little smaller than the earth - -
Look at that one.
- - would you look at that curvature?
Where is that dark spot?
The dark spot's right up here. You want to get the other lens on?
Yes.
Don't you want to get the earth coming up? It's going to be 9 minutes.
Yes, let's take some pictures here, first.
Well, don't miss that first one.
See how am I doing. Yes, you're right.
We'll need - we need to catch it about 10.
Shoot, you're going to have plenty of passes. _page : 72
Yes, right.
Plenty of earthrises, I guess.
Yes, we are.
Are we about there?
Boy, look at that ... crater. You can probably see him right there.
Yes, that's what I was talking about just a minute ago. It's kind of hard to believe that that's volcanic and formed by some faulting, isn't it? I don't believe that - but it's such a perfect straight line.
Hope none of those meteors come by right now.
Let me look through the sextant, Neil.
Well, where's the freaking earth going to be now? I'm confused.
In plane, I hope.
How are you doing on your roll there?
Well, we got about another 60 degrees to go. When's AOS?
15 - we're 7 minutes away.
Okay.
What a spectacular view!
God, look at that moon!
Fantastic. Look back there behind us, sure looks like a gigantic crater; look at the mountains going around it. My gosh, they're monsters.
See that real big - -
Yes, there's a moose down here you just wouldn't believe. There's the biggest one yet. God, it's huge! It is enormous! It's so big I can't even get it in the window. You want to look at that? That's the biggest one you ever seen in your life. Neil? God, look at this central mountain peak.
...
Isn't that a huge one?
Look at the ... Did you get some pictures of that?
Yes, I just took one. Can take another one here when he gets around a little better. It's fantastic!
That's kind of a foggy window.
That's a horrible window. It's too bad we have to shoot through this one, but - Oh, boy, you could spend a lifetime just geologizing that one crater alone, you know that?
You could.
That's not how I'd like to spend my lifetime, but - picture that. Beautiful!
Yes, there's a big mother over here, too.
Come on now, Buzz, don't refer to them as big mothers; give them some scientific name.
It sure looks like a lot of them have slumped down.
A slumping big mother. Well, you see those every once in a while.
Most of them are slumping. The bigger they are, the more they slump - that's a truism, isn't it?
That is, the older they get.
Well, we're at 180 degrees, and now we're going to want to stop that and start a slow pitchdown. We want to go - -
We're not going to see the earth come up over the horizon. _page : 74
- - about 70 degrees.
It says pitchdown or pitchup?
Pitchdown, so we're looking forward.
Pitchdown, so we're looking forward, alright. I wonder what kind of a rate we ought to - -
We got 4 minutes to get down.
Alright.
Never make it. There's a couple of new craters.
There's a good view of that -
Look warm down there, Neil?
I sure can't tell.
Looks hotter than hell to me. Boy, look at the size of that one.
Golly! Whoo! Get another picture of that big fellow.
Yes. I'm going to take one out here of him.
I've got an Easter egg coming up, gentlemen.
That's good. Gosh, it's 1 o'clock already.
Hey, you know, we got a TV show at -
...
Huh?
The next REV around, that is.
Before LOI 2.
Yes.
Could you give me a gimbal angle to pitch to? _page : 75
What are you going to do on that one?
Oh, I guess - get 10 pictures of the moon.
What did you want, Mike?
A gimbal angle to pitch to - if it's pitchdown 70 - why, let's see, from 226, that's 70, that's 296?
Yes, you were at 2 -
296, I would guess. How many minutes we got – to AOS?
About another minute and a half.
(Coughing)
I rolled to slow - doubt that we'll make it. Oh, look what I got. ...
Golly damn! A geologist up here would just go crazy.
You want the flight plan?
Yes, please.
Okay, we shouldn't take any more pictures on this roll until earth comes, I don't think; this is - -
About out?
- - just about out and it's on our last color roll, so we'll switch to black and white as soon as we get to earth.
We might make it in time.
Yes.
There it is, it's coming up!
What?
The earth. See it? _page : 76
Yes. Beautiful.
It's halfway up.
We ought to have AOS now.
You got your - -
Right over the LM.
Are you set up?
Just about to be cut off by the LM. Boy, does that ever look beautiful in the sextant.
Have you got - -
Okay, how about MSFN -
We're in OMNI - -
DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
- - Bravo.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Yes, we sure do, Houston. The LOI 1 burn just nominal as all getout, and everything's looking good.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11 - -
That's why I'm trying to get it out.
No alignment this REV, huh?
Mike, I guess the name of the game is to go back to - B OMNI?
Huh?
Go back to B in OMNI? _page : 77
Well, let's see - when we come over the hill next time, we're supposed to have them on the high gain, I think.
Not sure of that.
...
Did you use this thing?
No.
Well, let's get rid of it then; I can't see a crapping ...
77:44 - okay, - LOS is right on schedule.
77:50, we'll be at the prime meridian; now, I can set that map up so it'll tell us where we are.
Okay.
We - we're ahead on this eat period - we're behind on the last eat period or something. We got a ...
I think, Buzz, if you put - put the HIGH GAIN to MANUAL and go pitch 20 - yaw 360 - pitch minus 20, I guess - -
Minus 20; yes, that would be better.
- - and yaw 360 - -
That's okay assuming I'm at the right attitude, but I ain't going to be at the right attitude - not without wasting a lot of gas. Put -
That's fine, but -
If you did, it would be very interesting that way.
Yes. Oh, crap.
We get HIGH GAIN and we get TV at the same time - -
Well, I better start maneuvering then; doggone it, I've been yawed out of plane somehow. Let's see, we're pitched down - we want to pitch back up - pitched down, doggone it. ACCEL COMMAND, pitch down.
Okay, well - are we going to unlock the camera store and get all that claptrap put together?
Yes.
Okay.
Which window you want to operate out of, so I can figure out how to put the monitor on?
Well, I suppose the best one would be the center window, don't you think?
Probably, I don't know; wait until we get into attitude.
Get into attitude - see what we think.
Oh, shit; this pitch here is no good; 32, huh? Pitch 315 I want to be at, huh? Alright. They keep - all they do is they say ORB rate and that little attitude right there and right there applies to the rest of this page, all of that page, and over to this page.
Okay, so that's the one we'll do.
Okay, that's the way I'm rolling.
And we'll take the - we'll have HIGH GAIN - -
Yes.
- - and we'll get the camera out of the center window, if that looks reasonable.
Okay.
We'll have to give them pictures of the moon.
... I've been plotting on them ... 50:05.
We'll have a gouge as to where we are. _page : 79
55 -
Outside, huh? Alright, the switch is set for outside.
Could I have that map that y'all were looking at before, that lunar map? Thank you.
Hmm - here comes the moon.
Really beautiful.
Hey, you - -
I wonder where we are.
- - we're going to stop here pretty soon, right?
Yes, at 315.
(Whistling)
Man, that's really -
It really looks gray to me now.
...?
... right down toward the ground here.
- - and you could be busy getting up supplies if you ...
About a minute from AOS.
Okay, let's get out of this; let me get VERB 62. Okay, Mike?
Oh, I really need these ..., Buzz; I really need these goddam ...
Well, we're not going to have much of a TV unless we get high gain.
Alright.
I'll give it back to you - ... _page : 80
You got yourself some rates going about like what you want?
You got - you got high gain right now, I mean the angles, right now.
And we're 23 - we're 30 seconds from AOS, so those angles should be okay. You reading them?
Minus 30 pitch - -
Yes.
- - 150 yaw, okay.
No, that's not 150 - that's 15. Isn't it?
Just a second. Yes, minus - I'm sorry, minus 31 and plus 15. Right. You got it?
Yes.
I don't know what f-stop I ought to be at - Well - See what it's doing, Mike?
...
The flicker I don't know about, the white dot is - -
Yes, the flicker - -
- - the flicker is what I'm - Nothing I can - -
Okay, we got it solid.
- - nothing you can do about the flicker.
Got it solid on AUTO.
Houston, Apollo 11. Are you picking up our signal okay?
Another 5 minutes, Neil babe.
Okay. _page : 81
This pitch angle is quite a bit off nominal; 196 instead of 212.
Umm.
16 degrees.
Yes, Shaffer screwed up - got to get his eccentric orbit.
We is there.
Okay, I think I got Denebola in sight; let me look at the - Sure enough, I do. And it's good enough in the telescope; let me check it through the sextant. It's even in the sextant.
Beautiful! Fantastic!
Let's burn.
That's MANUAL and ZERO - ZERO and MANUAL.
We done paid our debt to society; we done made a star check. 79:50 -
It used to be that you couldn't get control on LOI 2; that any burn, any attitude you made was safer than the regular attitude, but that isn't true any more.
Yes.
Okay, we got the OPTICS, ZERO?
Yes, I'm sure it is.
And we're not going to do any VERB 41, NOUN 91, any of that stuff - -
No ...
- - so you can - enter on this one.
Okay. OPTICS, ZERO, ZERO, huh?
No! _page : 82
Supposed to be 0.7.
Oh.
Okay?
VERB 37, ENTER; 40, ENTER.
How does that look?
Looks beautiful. You enter on it, huh?
No. Leave it there.
Alright.
Align spacecraft roll, GDC ALIGN.
Yes, here we go - ... doesn't look bad.
No, I just got through aligning it a little while ago.
Okay, GDC's aligned.
Okay.
Check the circuit breakers.
Alright. I got - -
SCS circuit breakers.
SCS; they're all in.

Okay, what time do you have?
Okay, we've got - 18 minutes, roughly.
That TVC gimbal drive's taking up the power?
TVC - -
Putting out?
- - SERVO POWER?
No. The TVC GIMBAL DRIVE, PITCH and YAW, to AUTO. That didn't do anything, did it?
No. No, that didn't do a thing; servo power's what takes it.
You know not to leave them on too long. _page : 84
19 seconds to ullage; two jets.
Okay, 19 seconds, two jets.
A valves only.
Okay.
What did you get out of P30 as far as HA and HP?
I got the right numbers.
65.7, 53.7?
You got these?
Yes. 65.6, 54.6. ... should get those up.
...
Now, let's see, we can take off the 16-millimeter magazines and the 70-millimeter magazines.
I've got your stopwatch.
Okay, burn time is - -
Light the motor.
- - 17 and 1 second overburn, almost ... minutes.
Do it right here.
When's TIG?
11.
80:11:36.
17 seconds - 17 plus 1, huh?
Those little - fluorescent things on there must be from the heat and transfer.
Where are they? On the command module?
No. _page : 85
On the LM?
No.
I don't know, but the command module's got about ...
Little fluorescent - circles?
There's one of them.
There's some in a lot of failures.
The only thing is all the engineering that went into those damn things, too. There's a lot of time and money down the pipe.
I mean, this big monstrosity out here, it fails -
Hey, we're coming up - You can see the horizon -
See if that looks pretty good - through the sextant and see if that doesn't come up.
Zap.
Sure has been ... back here.
Poor old LM is contaminated; it's got urine particles all over it; and, the way the light's shining here, they look yellow. You know, those little - I guess it probably is a little – solid now, the - everything else has boiled off and it's left a little solid.
..., huh?
... solid urine particles are ...
I guess.
Wait until the back contam - forward contamination people hear about that.
Yes.
No more urine dumps on the way to the moon. Put it all in a nice little bag and – _page : 86
You're not - you've got plenty of black and white film, don't you?
Yes, plenty of black and white film.

Use as much as you want of anything you want. 80 millimeter, 250, it's all good.
We got 20 minutes until TIG. Oh, excuse me, 10 minutes - 10 minutes until TIG, excuse me. A little over 10 - 80:11 - -
Give me a call at about 7 minutes to go.
Okay, right now -
MARK it.
Yes, siree; that there is rough - rough terrain.
I've got kind of an idea that I'm going to be getting a picture of that - ...
... all those characters back there.
8 minutes until TIG.
Boy, there's a crater right in the side of the wall.
It's a much bigger crater, and I'll be damned if it doesn't look like it just went in sideways.
Okay, 7 minutes. Okay?
... going to do it -
Buzz, you want to read us that checklist; we'll use my panel chart. Which checklist would you like?

All those listening to the tape, please report that - we need a change in the checklist.
66.1 by 54.4; now you can't beat that.
No, this is about - -
That's right downtown.
- - this is 65.7 - -
By 54 point - -
We're more elliptic now, huh?
That's about as close as you're going to get.
Yes, I bet we never get circular.
Hey, have you got any more circuit breakers – I mean any more switches for me?
No. When everybody likes this one, why don't you try VERB 83 or a VERB 66 or a - suit yourself. See how much ... you put in.
158. _page : 94
15.8, huh?
158.
Or 158, that's about right. Okay.
Everybody happy with that?
That's reasonable.
VERB 66; want to have a vote on VERB 66?
No!
Everybody in favor of VERB 66 raise their right arm.
Yes, yes.
Okay, check it again. ... Well, let's see; we didn't gain any on the old PUGS that time; we're still 0.2 behind.
Oh, I suspect you're right; we probably never will.
No. Ne should have wrapped that thing up during ...
Check the increase that time?
Huh?
Did you check the increase that time?
If it increased, it's going to stay increased from now on.
Okay.
But I waited for it to start an upward trend on the first burn.
Understand; that's alright.
Alright - back to the flight plan.
... 33, as I remember it - the right number - - _page : 95
...
Yes, roll 180, pitch down 81, ORB rate. God damn, here comes the draft again.
Okay, we're supposed to start charging battery A.
Charge battery A, huh?
Let's see what we have; SPS monitor check - -
Two breakers out there; two breakers out there - BAT B, BAT B. BAT A, you say - Neil?
BAT A, yes - if you please. Charging BAT A, then on to - -
Then roll 180, and then we'll talk about this pitchdown, alright?
Then you might as well go to your - 293 INERTIAL, I guess.
Man, that's a gas waster. Soon as I get around here, I'll start it. We'll pass through ORB rate at some point. Takes forever and a day to get around here.
It's going to be a long time before that battery gets back up to 39-1/2 volts.
We done plumb tuckered that one out.
LOI 1 could've got to it, I imagine.
Yes.
Are you going to maintain ORB rate?
Yes, I guess so. It's going to be sort of a passthrough ORB rate kind of thing because, see if I whip - do it in a hurry, why I got to pitch down 80 degrees, stop the pitch, or stop almost all of it, except for the ORB rate amount. That's going to waste a hell of a lot of gas.
Do we have to do anything - to the O2 to pressurize the LM? _page : 96
No, we haven't - small enough – DELTA-P -
That's 0.9.
0.9?
Yes.
Yes, we have to build up pressure a little bit.
Build up that cabin pressure just a little bit, and I'll start the DIRECT O2 valve, OPEN.
It says observe the lunar surface.
That's what it says you ought to supposed to be doing.
It's brown; it's brown.
Brown all around. There's no doubt which way that - little crater hit.
Here's that same one going by again, Neil, remember? That bright Job?
Yes.
Man, there's white stuff all over - and it's black right around the rim.
Hey, well, I'm - while this thing's rolling over, I'm going to take a pee; I'm going to go pee.
180, if you don't mind.
That's a spectacular crater.
Did you shoot some pictures while you were over there?
No, it's just going by - we'd better get it later; there will be better times. If the damn antenna isn't in the way -
Boy, there must be nothing more desolate than to be inside some of these small craters, these conical ones. _page : 97
People that live in there probably never get out.
Yes, I think you're right. Boy, you can really see the slumping, though. Most of the - You can see where it's all gathered down in the bottom in the corner; you know, on the edge - where a lot of the white stuff has dribbled on down – and evidently it gets covered over after a while with a - a darker layer. There's always a certain amount of the white stuff right in the edges. Pretty characteristic of all of these – white conical ones.
Yes, you know, you can change the color of what you're looking at by moving your head to a different spot in the window - and looking in a different direction.
And that must be big ... right down there.
I haven't heard any woo-woo's.
Is there something we should be woo-wooing about?
Wait until we get the VHF on, then we'll hear the woo-wooing.
Okay.
Man, I sure hate to say it based on looking through this monocular, but there's a white spot that's just like a crater - looks like an awful lot under these small fresh ones in the bottom of this rather old crater, but right in the center of it, it looks like instead of there being a crater, looks like it's a rock. ... My eyes deceiving me.
How's our roll doing, Neil?
Oh, you got about 30 degrees to go.
Oh, boy!
Okay.
How far you going to roll? _page : 98
Over and over.
Got that DIRECT O2 ..., didn't you?
Yes, just a tiny bit.
Okay.
It'd be kind of interesting to see some of this dump go on straight from polar orbit. Wonder how long it's going to take before it impacts?
It obviously - is not really in polar orbit if it's going off - going off that way. Yes, it's inclined to the small angle.
Sure looks like it.
It's going straight out there through. That's real funny.
Son of a gun, that one's got a little – little curve on it.
Would you believe that, Neil? One went out and curved around like that. Can you explain that?
I guess it just glanced off another particle or something.
Oh, no, no, no, no; if it's curved.
It had a little bubble in it that came to the surface and went kapoom and - -
No - -
There's atmospheric drag up here.
- - departed it with a little DELTA-V.
I think what's really happening is - we're rolling and - it's changing the angle that I'm looking out the window.
Let's see, I want to pitch down 80 degrees to - - ... 293, down 293, I believe that, I wonder what rate would be reasonable – _page : 99
Okay, it's about 7 minutes until AOS.
Down 80 degrees in 7 minutes, that's - let's see, about 10 degrees per minute, 10 degrees per minute is -
... floating up here -
61 ...
Well, Mike probably let him out.
Okay, that ought to almost get it there and, damn, I don't want to see any more than that.
You can open the battery ... pad.
That ought to be enough.
...
Alright, where are we? We're pitching down. Gee, it's too bad we can't stop right here and observe the earth come up. You know, we ought to get that picture one time.
We probably can do it. You could stop it right here if you wanted to spend the gas.
Yes. That's the only trouble, the doggone gas. What are you on?
A picture looking out over the LM as well.
Yes.
Shouldn't be a bad picture. Why don't we stop it?
Okay.
We ought to be able to get high gain from this attitude, shouldn't we?
Think we ought to get the long lens on, Mike?
Yes, we ought to get the 250 - we ought to do it at 250. _page : 100
You've got 4 minutes; that's plenty, Now, we're going to want to - -
Are we at a good enough attitude? I hope so. We are out this window, babe, but we're not out that one. If the earth is right there, that's where it's coming up, huh? Better be.
You want color?
Ah - -
We better have color.
Yes, we want color.
I got a clean window over here so don't sweat that one too much.
250 - hand me your camera, Neil, and I'll change it.
Who's got the Hasselblad?
Probably over there on the shelf.
We got it. First quad is in - back is - -
That wall of that crater looks pasty through the sextant. Great big chunks of white stuff that just slumped down.
Did you get - ...? If you get too far over here, we may have to watch our pitch angle. We're good right now.
...
ORB rate -
No, we're not ORB rate.
The earth's going to be coming ORB rate at us.
...
Okay. Let's see, I've got to pitch up a tad then ... _page : 101
Okay, I've still got f:8 and ...
250th at f:8, I think we can do it, and infinity.
I don't know; what's the matter with where you had it?
Oh, son of a gun! (Laughter) We're going backwards. Oh, well.
Oh dear. Dumbkopf!
That's it, I think, there, Neil - so pitch down.
Prior planning prevents poor performance.
Thank you. Is that right, Buzz?
All that - Where'd you ever hear that one, Buzz?
I can't think.
Oh, that's a bright one; I got to get that one ...
No lie!
150 - you don't want to take too many on this.
No. Might as well put the other one back on.
Well, you might save that for some earth shots.
Wow!
...
You got it, huh?
I think it focused the second one a little bit better. I think it's beautiful. Just fabulous. Not really sure what you're looking at - but there's some mighty big fresh rocks down in that crater.
The walls actually look pockmarked. Sure enough, and they're not filled in. Pockmarked and it looks like somebody's painted white paint vertically down the edges and then it's been eaten away. _page : 102
... that one ... into the LM.
Here is the earth. Hey, I got the view over here.
I guess I'd better get the high gain off, hadn't I?
Did it just come up?
Yes.
We need that ...
Do we still got high gain?
Yes.
It's says minus 67 and zero.
Minus 67 and zero.
And zero.
Okay, MANUAL - and - AUTO - medium. There we go. Can't make up his mind between zero and - 360. Okay, we got them.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. ...
Do you want to talk to them?
... Roger, Houston. Burn status report follows: DELTA-TIG zero; burn time, 17; angle through the pad values, DELTA-VGX was plus 0.3; VGY, minus 0.0; VGZ minus 0.1; DELTA-VC, minus 5.2; fuel, 362; OX, 364; unbalance, plus 50, and a postburn NOUN 94, 66.1 by - -
Well, they look like they were made to go - That's - that's it, isn't it? Weren't they made to put here so you stow them by putting them on here instead of the way we do it?
... _page : 103
Then we only have to decide what - what's supposed to go here.
I ... two of them.
Both of those - those things are in here.
... worry about nothing goes in there ...
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We've played back the LOI 2 burn. It looks really good to us. The systems were all good. We got an orbit on the limited amount of tracking at 65.4 by a 53.9. Over.
Sounds good, Houston.
I need that film now.
Okay.
...
Okay, want to get film. It's a long trip to the film container.
You want something?
Oh, shoot. I'm going to have trouble getting in there.
How's it going, Neil? You getting any?
...
Well - Buzz, the 70-millimeter container's only got one black and white and one color in it - Isn't it supposed to - -
That's - that's not - that's mine.
You've got the wrong one.
No, that's not the right one.
The one - -
The one you want, Neil, is way over here in – R-13. _page : 104
No, it's not in there; it was on my girth shelf.
Okay.
Oh, okay, there it is. Did you get that one put back?
No, but I will.
Okay, appreciate it. I had it in my mind that - our - -
You want to do something to the polarizing filter, Neil?
Uh - -
I'll stick it up there on the ceiling. There's a - -
- - not really.
- - we got room for it up there.
You want the 16-millimeter while you're down here, Neil?
Yes.
The 16-millimeter bag as well?
Yes, I'll take that one, too.
Okay.
Well, that - damn stuff won't stick. Haven't got a piece of Velcro on there yet.
You're not ...
Man, can't you stop some of that racket up there?
Huh?
That's the S-band - you turn your volumes down.
(Coughing) _page : 105
Is that better on the S-band?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
(Sneeze)
There's one that's got mission rules in it – but I can't place - at the moment, put my hands on it. ...
It's a NO-GO - GO/NO-GO - the one one I'm looking for. Hey, that's beautiful.
Like this?
Yes.
That's the one we made the changes in, right?
Right.
It may be up in the - in the command module, huh? Have you got another clip?
For the window?
I thought we might just stick my – activation checklist right - right there, and we'll be all ready coming in.
Right here?
Yes. ...
We may be ending up with one more than we're authorized - one, two, three, four, five. Yes, one of these will be changed over to - As a matter of fact, I stole one from Mike - but one of them we'll change over to the - -
I'll go check around up here.
Oh, wait a minute, here it is. I got it. _page : 106
I don't think the - -
This other one got changed.
No, it didn't.
You want to do that?
Yes, I can do that.
And in the meantime - Let's see, where'd the film go?
Now, the thing that would be nice to find out is if - how well - go - the 80-millimeter - with the film pack on it - in color.
You do put these in with this dark slide in, don't you? Is that right?
Which one you got? 60? 60 you do, and the 80 you - ...
...
Yes, dark slide in.
It'll lock it the other way. That - that side - it'll pull it closed.
Alright. ... for telling me.
Boy, that thing goes all over, doesn't it? Maybe we ought to - do these the other way around.
Neil, we got two magazines, two color, A ... - one of them is R and the other is S.
Yes.
I'm going to put the R in the reserve camera.
Okay.
And the S in the surface camera.
Good idea. _page : 107
Even though we're going to use them the other way.
Do you want to try it out in there?
I guess we could open the window here, just as well.
The window's all - frosted over.
Is it?
Well, I hate to stick my finger on it; I'm not sure which side it's on.
We'll have to - have to turn the heaters on tomorrow.
No, I think when the sun gets on them, it'll - ... them. Yes, the one on your side is ...
The black and white is magazine 2.
I don't guess there's any need to tape that up now.
We're on the back side now, right?
Yes, just come into - we're just coming into sunlight.
And we don't get the - contrast ...
What's the mission time, Mike?
Just a second. About 82 hours even.
82:02.
Okay, when do you get your tracking?
In a little while.
About what time?
About another half hour.
Before 83 hours? _page : 108
Wasn't like this yesterday - must be because the sun was on it.
Boy, look at that big mother coming up there. Looks like we're heading for - ... over the horizon.
I don't think there's any place except in the – in here, that it says anything about 16-millimeter footage -
In the card, right?
No, I'm thinking about for the descent. Here we are; 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. Okay.
You got the flight plan handy, Mike?
Yes, I have; just a second.
I don't want it up here; I just want you to - when you get a chance, to read off the items that are on there, make sure we got them.
It says perform housekeeping chores, stow helmets, stowage bags; unstow mirror, checklist, and disposal assembly. Stow interim stowage assembly, unstow and configure for use 16 millimeter, HC-EX, f:4, 500, infinity, 6 frames per second. That's all it says - on that page. That's where we are now. The next thing is an hour from now when we transfer to LM power and activate the COMM.
12 feet per second - half an hour.
Did you say something about taking pictures right now?
No, no; stop the camera.
Yes, I know, I don't think it'd take a very good picture right now.
One thing, when you get way up here, you can - see a lot more of that secondary strut.
No, that thing - that's holding up those damn baffles. _page : 109
Well, if we could get a towel, we could get us a couple of fair-to-middling pictures out of here.
Alright. You want one?
Yes. Maybe - Some of it will come off, anyway.
Hand me a towel when you get a chance.
... left window ...
This one's getting pretty well cleared off over here on the left.
You want the COAS in the forward window for undocking, huh? And you don't want the filter attached? I stuck it up here.
All that'll do is warm it up.
When do we have AOS?
Well, we - we should have AOS in - oh - 16 - 18 - in about another 20 minutes.
Alright, then, I think - the way we're sitting, why, we're going to be able to get a picture – of the earth coming right up there. What do you think about that?
Unique feature - photography (laughter). ... on the top of it.
What have you been using, 5.6 at 1/250th?
Yes. ...
What do you know, it works!
I could sure get the stop watch, huh?
Yes, you have the exact time to AOS - because I don't have my watch - set up for that.
...
... _page : 110
I'm just fooling around; what do you need - AOS time? AOS is going to be - well, let's see - 82:30 - about 15 minutes from now.
Okay. I'll get another good picture of what comes along. Well, hell, I guess we might as well load the other camera and make sure it works, too, huh?
Adjust the - chronometer and put the cables in it, huh?
Yes.
Well, look, if we load this one - if I put the film on this one, and take a picture or two, well, I'll have to take it back off again; that's the only trouble. I won't have to, but it doesn't stow as neatly. If you don't mind doing - powered descent with the camera in there, I think that's probably alright. Well, wait a minute, I bet I could put this one loaded where the other one goes -
Where have you hid the shaving cream, Mike?
No wonder - ...
Uh, ...
... that's the reason - -
No, I don't think you know; I don't think you know; I don't see how you know.
Hey, Neil, you see any need for keeping this thing?
What's that?
In the LM, this cover for the camera. Think about that for a while - I got it loaded, and I don't see any need to ever change it. If it works now - I guess if it quits before we actually went EVA, why there might be some reason to. 5.6 at 250th, huh?
Now, a few pictures of that and one of earthrise and - and then we'll stow it. _page : 111
Well, I can't do anything until we transfer to LM power.
Do you know where the shaving cream is?
Shaving cream?
Yes.
Yes, I sure do; it's - -
In the penlight.
- - in the penlight compartment, huh?
How about this thing; you see any need to – to keep that in the LM?
Neil, what did you do with the - ... camera back sight?
I haven't had it.
Okay. What do you think about that?
I can't think of any reason why we might use it.
Well, there's a COAS - dust cover that I think fits in the same category, don't you? The thing that you got to move out to put the COAS in?
He's shaving.
I'm through with the flight plan, Neil, if you want it.
...
... razor?
The razor should be in there with the shaving cream, isn't it?
No - -
It wasn't?
- - ... shaving cream. _page : 112
The razor wasn't in there?
The razor's in here, and I think the shaving cream was when I pulled it out, but - -
How much time to AOS, Mike?
82:30 - about 5 minutes.
Don't know what I'm doing with VHF B on.
Hey, Mike?
Yes.
You got VHF B available?
What? Say again?
I don't know. According to this lousy thing, I'm powering up VHF B - T/R.
Not right now, not for another half hour or so.
No, I know, but - Are you going to have your VHF on?
If I'm going to record your data, I am.
Well, it doesn't say doodly squat about recording data.
... coming up now.
Did you get them?
No, sure didn't.
Yes.
But I can't see ... - I see the earth, but it's a lousy picture.
Could you wait just 1? I'm right in the middle of the event-timer setting.
Okay, Houston. We'll be doing P22 in just a couple of minutes here. _page : 113
You want to come in, Neil? Going in?
Want back up?
No.
Here's your shaving cream.
My only problem is I'm going to come over here and grab a switch and arm this hand controller.
Alright. I'll be out of your way.
Okeydoke. I'll tell you what you could do, if you're not doing anything else, is - supposed to take five marks 30 seconds apart. When I take the first one, you can take a hack and see - -
Okay.
- - whether I'm spaced properly or not, you know what I mean?
Yes.
Coach me along on when to take mark number 2, mark number 3, 4, 5.
And could you give me a hack on the MDC mission timer? It's going up to 35 minutes. Ready -
MARK it.
35 minutes.
Okay, that's good. That program alarm is normal; it will reach that when the trunnion gets down below 50 degrees.
Okay.
All I'm doing is waiting for - the time; everything else is done.
You holding inertial, Mike?
Yes. _page : 114
No wonder the earth isn't moving.
Ho-hum, ho-hum. I only got set up for this thing about an hour early (laughter). Better late than never; better early than late.
... should be coming over the horizon here pretty soon.
What should be?
Old A-1. Old A-1.
Now, we'll see if you can find something that looks like A-1.
I got the earth down by the strut.
The problem with this window is, Neil, I think it's too cold in here.
Neil, I'm going to get up here and get pitch - MANUAL ATTITUDE PITCH to ACCEL COMMAND. Those hand controllers are armed, so beware.
Okay.
If I'd known you were going to be here, I'd of incorporated you into the procedures.
Keep looking through the periscope, then.
What I need is - 0.3 to 0.5 on this thing, closer to 3. I'd get it, but you - -
I'll watch.
- - just as a doublecheck - -
I'll watch.
The preflight - ...
That ... is working.
Okay, fine.
Okay, MARK it – _page : 115
Number 1. They're 30-second marks.
Check.
15.
How many?
15 - 20 - 25 - 30 -
MARK it -
Number 2.
Okay.
I have a feeling somehow I got to do these ...
15 -
Okay.
25 -
MARK it -
Number 3.
Okay.
15 - 20 - 25 -
MARK it -
Number 4.
Okay.
15 - 20 - 25 -
MARK it -
Number 5.
Okay.
... _page : 116
...
Check.
Checklist says - You're going to go blind doing this - ... 06 71 - confirm 7000; 06 89 confirm ... 320 7000 ... -
Just leave it; keep pitching?
Yes. But I don't know why we're getting that thrust rate there, maybe the ... getting unhappy - -
... look at that roll and stuff ... that yaw ...
Yes. It's Just like the simulator, remember that?
Yes.
It's ...
We're yawing pretty good. 0.4, I'd say - -
We're going to have to check that out.
- - towards gimbal lock.
Toward gimbal lock?
It's only gone 10 degrees towards gimbal lock.
Well, that's a pretty good error. I don't know why in the hell it does that.
Would you like to control the ...? I'd say we're going to keep pitching for quite a while.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. Are you copying NOUN 129 on your downlink? If you've had enough time, I'll proceed.
Look, what gimbal angle was that when - on the pitch - when that activity started, just out of curiosity?
Oh, must have been around - 210. _page : 117
Just like the simulator.
Okay, now, the flight plan says where we want to stop ..., that says so right here - pitch 229 is where we want to stop.
Okay, we've gone by that, however, quite a ways.
I'm sorry, let's stop, then.
Is that local vertical?
No.
Okay. And after those pictures, ... lunar surface.
You want to go back to 229 or what?
Let me see the flight plan just a second. Yes.
Might as well just - just let it stop itself, Neil.
I've got to - look at the - -
Yes, go ahead.
- - the ... ... like - gangbusters?
... 225 is ...
MARK -
02009.
MARK -
22590. Minus 00177.
Okay. So much for that.
A beautiful view out here, Neil.
...
What's the GET?
It's 82:51. _page : 118
There's Mount Marilyn.
Yes.
Okay, we didn't waste any gas by doing what we did, but what we wasted gas by was that goddamn DAP activity; I don't understand that. just like the simulator.
Sure enough.
You got a good view there, Neil?
Yes, I sure do.
Houston, Apollo 11.
All that procedure for P22 seemed to work very well. The only thing that was a little odd is that there was some DAP thruster activity. I had pitch in ACCEL COMMAND, and roll and yaw in RATE COMMAND, and somehow roll and yaw got excited, and DAP went into a flurry of thruster firing. We've noticed the same thing in the CMS and had just written it off as a CMS peculiarity.
Okay.
Well, one P22 out of the way. Ho, ho, ho!
What were the results?
Well - -
Or could you tell?
- - they're sort of inconclusive because I marked - see, they gave me -
That's in work, Houston. Hey, how about holding this for just a little bit?
Yes, let's hold this attitude a little bit; I want to look at the - -
Boy, that's beautiful out there, isn't it? _page : 119
- - TPI approach. Man, this is really something; you ought to look at this. You want to watch our approach into the landing site; you got to watch right through this window. We're coming over - we just passed Mount Marilyn. We're coming up on Maskelyne series here - straight out ahead, coming into the landing area.
Houston, we're holding inertial a little while to study the approach to the landing zone.
See the monocular -
I don't either, ...
Is there one?
Well, a crater - -
There go Sidewinder and Diamondback. God, if you ever saw checkpoints in your life, those are it.
But ... we don't get to see them.
You don't?
No, we roll over right here at this little - well, you see Boot Hill coming up right here?
Yes, yes, yes.
And just beyond it that's - that crater right on track there, the big one?
That's Mount Marilyn? Past Boot Hill?
No, Duke Hill.
Duke Hill?
No, I'm sorry ... that's - -
Duke Island, Duke Island.
Oh God, look at that Moltke; he's my favorite ... Look at that son of a bitch. You see all those roads - triangular roads leading right past him? _page : 120
Yes.
That's US 1, I guess, huh?
Yes.
There's crater 130 over there although I can't quite see - see 129, but I can't quite see 130.
Can you see ..., Neil?
I'm not sure.
I think I can see it, for sure. Yes, I got it beautiful - I can - I got the whole landing site here.
That far?
The one that's shorter there?
Houston, this is Apollo LM in the Eagle - Apollo 11 in the Eagle, and I got a beautiful view of the whole landing area.
Roger. I can see the entire landing area from the position I'm in looking out the left window in the LM.
...
That's right.
Boy, that sure is eerie looking.
Isn't that something?
...
... enough of a shot down there, but you can't find a single spot on the surface that doesn't look ... 1-degree sun angle, that's - that's just a lousy sun angle.
That's spectacular out there - Looks like you're flying right into the side of a mountain, doesn't it? _page : 121
Yes, sure does.
I missed taking a picture of it, ...
Well, that was good ... Shall we go to maneuver, I mean to sleep attitude - anybody object to doing that?
That'd be alright.
Okay, I'm ready for you cats to transfer to LM power. What time GET you got?
80 - -
Get the ..., Buzz.
- - 83 hours. You ready to do it?
...
You ready to do it?
Stand by. Yes, go ahead and do it.
Okay.
You got 83 hours right now, huh?
Yes, 83 hours, and we're on LM power.
Glycol pump.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on high gain? Over.
Okay. You want wide beam, for some reason?
Will you cut my SUIT POWER and AUDIO, OFF, please?
Yes.
Okay, fine.
Okay, going OFF now.
We're starting our maneuver to sleep attitude; roll 82, pitch 229, yaw zero. _page : 122
About ready to maneuver?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Yes?
You're past step 4?
Houston, 11.
What's the page?
Okay. We're on page - activation 12, 13, at step 4, verify descent talkbacks - gray, and they're barber pole.
Stand by. We've got it. We've just had – one circuit breaker out of position. We have them gray now.
Watch that.
Don't we want it dark?
I thought the lights were going out. Man, that voltage is really falling off.
Hey, Mike.
Yes.
... VHF ... circuit breaker ...
I can't hear you, Buzz.
He says, "Why don't you turn on VHF B, just for kicks."
Alright, I'll do it. You going to send me some data?
Yes, I'll get right to it.
Huh? _page : 123
I'll get right to it.
Alright.
Soon as I get some COMM first.
Yes, because when I - because when I record your data, I'm on SIMPLEX A.
Yes, well, that's when you're talking at the same time.
Yes, okay. You want me just to turn up B now?
There's signal strength.
Hello, Houston, hello, Houston; this is Apollo 11, Eagle. Over.
A lot of static - on the command module S-band.
Well, we - we should still have him.
Houston, Apollo 11. Radio check on S-band.
I'm not getting them on -
Well, we're almost at sleep attitude; just stand by 1, and, as soon as we get there, I'll find out where they are. I'm going to dick with the DAP right now.
I've got nothing but static.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Hey, Mike, you transmitting on B?
Mike, what are you transmitting on up there?
Say again.
What are you transmitting on up there?
I'm transmitting right now on OMNI A, but I'm about to get new high-gain angles; just 1 second. Okay, we're there. _page : 124
How come I - he don't hear you on INTERCOM?
You should hear - -
Houston, Apollo 11; Apollo 11, Eagle. Over.
Roger. I read you about 4 by 4. Could you give me a short count, please?
Gees, I don't hear him.
We don't read them, Buzz.
He's - he's on LM S-band, Neil, apparently.
Oh.
Yes.
Roger. Are you copying my LOW BIT RATE? Over.
Roger. I'm all ready to switch to HIGH BIT RATE, if that's okay with you.
Standing by.
Houston, Eagle. Go ahead with the camera checkout. I'm still on low taps, and I assume there's no problem doing that. Over.
Houston, Columbia. How do you read on the high gain?
Blap.
Did you hear him answer?
No.
I didn't either. Buzz is reading him, though.
Houston, Columbia. How do you read on the high gain? Over.
Hey, how about asking them if they can hear me calling? _page : 125
I don't believe they can hear you, Mike, ... sleep attitude.
Well, we're in sleep attitude, and I got the high-gain angles, and they should be good angles. And I'm locked on and I got about a half signal strength, and they can't hear me.
Houston, Eagle. ... high gain ...
No go.
What'd he say?
COMMAND RESET.
Okay.
... try him again.
Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear.
Armstrong says it's the hatch and - if we leave the probe and drogue there, we'll save us some time tomorrow; I don't know if it's tolerable sleeping or not. I think what previous crews have been doing is reinstalling all that claptrap up in there.
Yes.
But -
...
What?
...
Yes, forward's okay.
I don't think that would be too horrible sleeping down there.
It's for sure it's not going anywhere; this one's bolted down two places - and this one is - -
You can try it. If we could find a place to put our legs back in there, it'll be alright. _page : 126
See - it's going to be hard to get into that - sampler there.
No - no, that's alright. That's the place for it.
(Sneeze)
Okay, lights went out - except for all those radioactive ones in there.
Well, COMM's good. Son of a bitch might work.
Sure it'll work. Anything in a pretty cockpit like that is bound to work.
Well, I propose leaving the probe and drogue in here overnight. Save all - doing all that claptrap in the morning.
It's okay with me.
Fine.
You through in the LM?
How's that going to affect - -
Sleeping!
- - sleeping?
I'll be glad to sleep over there, alright? I don't think it'll affect that; I'd rather sleep, I'd rather sleep with the probe and drogue than have to dick with it in the morning.
Alright, that's fine; I can have it there. I don't know how I'd get out, but - (laughter).
...
That's ..., alright.
Hey, you don't want to bring this one back? You on a weight-saving kick for the command module?
You want it? _page : 127
Sure, you - -
There's room for the Hasselblad.
- - you got stowage space?
You can have it if you want it.
You got a place to fix things that rattle around?
Sure. Like hatches? ... if you'll take time to get out of the hallway.
Let's get some music.
Get out of my damn hallway, Aldrin, so I can put my hatch in and then we can all - -
How about these tapes?
Okay.
Okay, 95:50 IVT to the LM. What time is it now?
83:53.
I figure that as being 12 hours. About time for a Lomotil, huh? Well, not quite.
How about the systems stuff - to put the machine to bed.
You go to REACQ and NARROW?
Yes.
So I guess the COMM's pretty well taken care of?
Yes.
Have you got the waste water dump?
No, I haven't done that, but I will.
Let's see, I imagine we want to go out of VOICE? Or not?
Very, very - - _page : 128
The whole bit they said.
Okay.
Lunar orbit asleep; (cough) S-BAND SQUELCH, ENABLE?
I did it.
Got that, huh?
Yes.
HIGH GAIN, REACQ, NARROW; antenna pitch angle - -
Yes, I did that.
- - that's all it says.
Okay.
Plus the normal configuration.
Doesn't it say anything about DOWN VOICE BACKUP - or any of that stuff?
(Cough)
No.
Okay.
Waste water dump, we'll wait until 84 hours; they may have the vent modeled or some crazy thing like that, so I want to be at the right time.
Alright.
Well, let's see, normal lunar configuration. Well, it is DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
Yes.
Well, let's get going here. PRIMARY, PRIMARY, HIGH, VOICE, (cough) PCM, RANGE, DOWN VOICE BACKUP, AUX TAPE, OFF; TELEMETRY to DATA; and UP TIM COMMAND to NORMAL; VHF A and B, OFF; RECEIVE only, ...; PCM/ANALOG, RECORD, FORWARD, NORMAL, NORMAL - that's okay, LOW - PRIMARY, REACQ, and NARROW. Well, COMM's set.
Good.
I got to vacuum up some water and dump the waste water tank, and we're about set.
Hey, I got a fuel cell - O2 - -
Hey, our water's about all gone.
Did they say anything about the O2 purge?
Must have gone into the LM.
Yes, I think it did; it went on the windows. They didn't say anything about it, huh?
No.
Well, I guess we'll do it then. Anybody get my - Well, heck, I guess we're really not through with them yet, are we?
I updated the LOS time in your -
Yes. I think I'll wait until we get them back again before doing the purge. Okay? Because, I don't know, maybe they want all that stuff done on the back side.
Well, I propose to give myself a little bit of a - a bath, but not to put that damn LCG on tonight. You never did ask them about the - about the ..., huh? I sure haven't found them.
I think we ought to do that.
Neil, you still got that tissue dispenser, the empty one?
Thank you.
What's baseline altitude? ... the altitude - descent altitude settings? _page : 130
That's the - that's the last meal we eat before descent, huh?
Sure is.
Wowee!
95 - that's - 7 - got 10 hours. Whew!
Might whip out that piece of bread in there.
Through in the tunnel, Mike?
Through, yes.
Okay, I want to get the lights out then.
Okay, ...
What are your dosimeters reading?
... up a little bit.
Mine says - 11012.
I can't read this little fart. Says 10013.
I think they all started out at even thousands. They had them each different so they could tell which was which.
Well, I don't know about you, but I think I'll raid the pantry for some bite-size stuff.
I don't know when we'll get a chance to use it  maybe some time - -
Monoculars?
- - during the maneuvers.
Found it, huh?
We're going to take that into the LM.
Yes. Sure can. _page : 131
...
... - ... novel and earn a million dollars.
Amazing how quickly you adapt - Why, it doesn't seem weird at all to me to look out there and see the moon going by, you know?
(Laughter)
Oh, that is weird - that crazy moon out there again, huh? Funny-looking thing.
Buzz, this crazy bracket goes right here. It's probably right the hell in your way, isn't it?
No, no.
Not in your way?
No, I can survive with that.
Alright, let me put it up there; it'll be one less thing to do in the morning. It's in backwards, but I don't think -
Well, if I don't need this thing anymore, I think It'll stow that one away. Systems are yours tomorrow?
Yes.
I don't know as we've got much to do; there's a purge.
Is it 84 hours yet? Yes, it is; I'm going to dump the waste water.
You dumping?
Yes.
(Cough) Boy, it's a dusty vehicle in here. Man! But that view approaching the landing site is just fantastic right out - right smack out the window, you know that? _page : 132
Yes.
Except there's such a big shadow being cast by everything - -
1 or 2 degrees, Neil?
- - that I really couldn't - -
I think ... - -
- - I could identify the Cat's Paw and I could identify the pair of craters right at the end, but I couldn't really make out the backward V nor the three little curved ones on one side - -
I didn't see the backwards either.
- - but I could see the area where it all was, you know, and - -
Yes, yes.
- - it didn't go any farther back that this, and it didn't really go any farther forward than that - it really didn't. You know, it was rougher than a cob (laughter).
Rougher than a cob, but I didn't see ...
Well, when you compare it with the surrounding areas, why it's - it's pretty reasonable.
You want this somewhere?
...
If you don't mind, I'll put it on this big piece of Velcro over here by the fuel cell.
Yes, that's a good place for it.
Anybody for a barf bag?
Can you think of any use for a slide rule in the LM, Neil? _page : 133
Huh?
I can't think of any use for two of them.
Okay.
That COMM was so good I don't think I'd need those damn things ...
Anybody say anything about terminating battery current?
No.
You remember anything about that, Neil?
No.
Somebody's blue towels? Did I dislodge those by mistake or did you have those?
No, don't believe I had them.
I had them out, kind of floating around back here.
Everything I think you could dislodge, they forgot to put Velcro on the damn thing.
Could you - maybe reach back and - hand me that wrench right quick?
Yes, I sure could. Sure could ...
You want me to swap one?
No, I think I'll keep one for tonight.
Okay.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
You like this?
Not much. _page : 134
...?
Want one?
Yes.
He's getting a ... of that, huh?
Well, I just want to make sure I'm through with the roll; I think I am.
Can't figure out how you tell when one's gone. I think that was it.
Oh, it stopped!
It's a bear to get in and out of here.
Think maybe it'd be easier if you ... them right here.
I have a bit of fruitcake left over from somewhere; if anybody wants some, here it is. ...
Let's have a little chewing gum. Anybody like some chewing gum?
40 - and 250.
43 ...
- - 1000 pounds - ...
That'll bring some more junk back here.
Couldn't have done better myself.
It may be raunchy later.
It may be? There's no doubt about it!
Oh, I'll take a couple small ones.
Apollo 11, Houston. We have LOS coming up in 2 minutes now, and AOS will be at 86 plus 28 plus 15. Over. _page : 135
We'll see you on the other side.
Anybody have one?
I'll have a little one.
Okay. Here you are.
Yes.
Okay.
I guess what I'm doing I should do with the paper towels.
Everybody through with the water?
Yes, go ahead.
Ever find your box?
No. Gosh, you remember when they told us about - about putting buttons on the seat of these pants?
No, I don't remember.
Yes, they were working out - this elaborate scheme.
Yes, ... had a choice between ... and Velcro.
What's its use? I mean, don't keep me hanging in suspense.
Well, whatever I tell them, they didn't give me.
Shouldn't have anything.
Nothing in it.
Good grief, man!
They tell me you got to use Velcro on there. Maybe on the other side.
Use -
I got a - pair of jockey shorts. Now cut - cut the lights off - lights off. _page : 136
Very good, very good.
How'd you sleep last night, Buzz, up on top?
You open up the outer one, and you put the inner one in there and squeeze it and it breaks, then you got to take the ... and insert it and mush it all up - to get that stuff evenly distributed through it.
Why don't you guys sleep underneath tonight? I'll sleep top deck.
Oh, you're going to sleep downstairs tonight, aren't you?
Yes, that's right; I remember ...
Unless you'd rather sleep up top, Buzz; I like - you guys ought to get a good night's sleep, going in that damn LM - How about - which would you prefer? Is that probe and drogue going to be in your way over there?
No, I don't think so.
Well, take your druthers, whichever you prefer.
Anybody ... goes right up here?
I've just been kind of looking around for it myself.
..., Buzz?
...
What?
I ... you.
Oh.
...?
Yes, yes.
Yes, I ... _page : 137
Well, I thought today went pretty well. If tomorrow and the next day are like today, we'll be safe.
You got a crater coming up, Buzz? Right through here. I don't know if you can see it or not. If not, let me get a picture of it because it's really - got big ... on the bottom of it. It don't look good.
It's out this way.
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.
Shoot ... here.
I'm not sure we should be shooting this – what we're shooting at or 1 point set; I guess you're alright - in this light stuff, I guess you're alright.
Okay, thank you.
Oops! ...
What time is it, Neil, 88 hours, something like that?
86:13.
Doesn't it look like some of these crater walls had scallops inside like a design in a fan – like feathers.
Seashells.
Yes.
Like seashells - very pretty, very symmetrical.
Take along one of those craters.
I took overlapping pictures of all that ...
Tomorrow, take - we're going to have to carry a lot of film to take as many pictures as they want. _page : 138
I'll tell you what we ought to do, ...
Oh, okay, let me go do that.
Anybody know when AOS is?
When is AOS?
Yes. When is AOS ...?
86:38?
I think it's ...
Okay.
... along in here.
Yes.
Where the hell is the horizon with the world coming over it? I guess it's behind us, huh?
Up there? We should be getting earthshine – earthrise features - should be coming up pretty soon.
Black and white.
There's a colored one right in there - I didn't think we put it there. ...
Alright.
There's this one - where's - -
The dark slide I think is right over there in the girth shelf.
Oh, yes, I got it.
That's - that's the one.
Are we going to keep the ... lens on?
... getting earlier in time. Yes, that's best - better. _page : 139
...
Got a MASTER ALARM coming on here.
Your f:8 is 250 - at infinity?
Yes.
Good deal. Keep working, you got a lot of film.
Well, it's ...
And I was ...
Good deal.
...
Glad to hear it.
Through?
Yes - ...
It's good ...
Yes, I guess so. Nothing like filming your ...
... this field of view, it's mostly just blues - I keep getting mostly black and blue.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Okay. We just appeared to get a solid lock for the last - oh, about a minute, the TUNE FOR MAX needles have been wandering up and down and the pitch and yaw needles have been wandering around, but it appears to have reacquired by itself solidly now. We're just filling - finishing up our fuel cell purge. Hydrogen on number 3 is the last to go off, and it'll be coming off in just a second.
Huh? Is that right? Really should have looked.
... flow?
RATE to HIGH, Neil. _page : 140
I'll need to holler across to you to get the mission timers on. Do we want to check and get our two mission timers SYNC'd? What's this one read now? 82:50?
51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56 - -
Okay, this one is 1 second slow down in the LEB.
Let's see, these things come in the command module don't they, those umbilicals?
...
Well, we don't want them.
...
Anyway, it compares.
...
Well, we couldn't do that without switching - well, you can have them in here all the time.
... there's no way for me ... probe and drogue ... docking ...
No, I can't think that that'd be of significance between them - because why would you ever care to whether you'd hook them up again, if you came back and docked?
Here's this LCG check. "Verify ... stick visible in red or green band."
Yes. Not ... as it should be.
The red one comes out this far, and the green one's out further than that. The whole thing is only about that long. It's got to be in one or the other or you can't see it.
Having any luck there, Michael?
... _page : 141
You don't need to take - you're not taking your scissors over there?
No.
I've got ...
... pad; I'm going to have to take a leak here.
Yes, I guess I'd better take that pocket – and the purse. Tell you what - How about putting those tissues in that box that's got that spare camera in it?
Okay.
It'll be right handy on your side over there. Now where did the tissue box go?
You want to see if the computer agrees with that mission timer?
I did already.
Okay.
Can you hand me that purse and the - that bag of mine - and the checklist?
And if you'll take me off of suit power.
Okay. SUIT POWER is OFF; AUDIO is OFF. Whoops - Sorry.
...
Good.
About ready for a little help? ... that.
What's that?
... I only have one ... left.
Okay. Oh, let's see, one smell - blah.
(Humming) _page : 142
Okay.
You want one?
...
Yes.
...
We've got a roll rate in; 0.3-degree roll rate. Now it's taking it out; now it's taking it back out the other way.
... Now, let's see.
I'll keep an eye on ... for you.
... on here.
Okay, I'm going on.
Okay.
What's that?
Did you repress, huh?
How come you don't ... LM power?
Okay. Stand by. You're on LM power. What?
What did he say?
...
Oh, what time is it? It's 95:54.
Now, switch from RATE, HIGH, to RATE, LOW. But that might make it better and maybe a little bit worse.
...
I guess that's right then, Neil; it rattles across the deadband at a fairly high rate. _page : 143
...
Alright.
...
Sure as hell is.
I can't get that ...
This one - this one? That won't hurt it. ...
Stand by for some MASTER ALARMS; I'm purging. _page : 144
...
Oh, ..., Mike.
It's 96 hours even. 96 even and coming up on 40 seconds. Ready -
MARK it.
...
Okay, 96:01 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 -
MARK -
96:01.
3, 4, 5.
Good.
Okay, stand by for more thruster firing here.
Is this - -
No, this one's yours. You going to wear this for - -
...
Okay, I'm going to ... camera out of its way.
...
Okay, I wouldn't be surprised .... all over this goddam stuff.
A three-ring circus. I got a fuel cell purge in progress and trying to set up cameras and brackets, watch an AUTO maneuver, and -
Jesus Christ! _page : 145
NORMAL, NORMAL.
Another MASTER ALARM coming.
Stand by for MASTER ALARM.
Neil, where's the voice tape recorder, you know?
Might be in the ...
Okay. Oh, you son of a bitch, you! Gah!
...
...?
Can't get it ...; it's behind the ...
Yes.
... hard time getting anything down here ...
Okay.
You got some things up there.
Neil, all this food and stuff up here, you going to take with you, or drink, or eat?
No, I'll take ...
Okay. Chewing gum, you want any of that?
... concerned ...
...
Neil, I hate to bother you; could you get my solo book out of R-1 there?
What?
My solo book out of R-1.
Solo book? _page : 146
Yes. Look - -
R-1?
Yes, it should be in R-1. Big frapping book, with a bunch of updates on the cover. Thank you, that's it. Appreciate it.
Neil, do you recall the highest rate you saw during this recent thruster activity? Did you say 0.4 or thereabouts?
What?
Do you recall the - any kind of body rates that you saw during that thruster activity? Didn't you say something about 0.4? Maybe – remember when the SCS was acting up?
Ah - -
Houston, Columbia. Over.
- - this is Houston. You can turn on the IMU. Over.
Houston, this is Columbia. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Hey, Buzz? How about - -
Eagle, Houston. We'd like aft now and forward at AOS. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. 30 seconds to LOS. Both spacecraft looking good going over the hill. Out.
Eagle, Columbia. _page : 147
Go ahead.
Roger. I'm getting ready to preload the probe. I'm going to disable all my roll thrusters. Would you please monitor my roll, your yaw?
Roger.
Eagle, Columbia.
Go ahead.
I got another "Verify capture latches engaged" on my checklist. I've already preloaded the probe; it's sort of silly, but sort of your option whether you want to verify they're engaged or not.
Okay, we got the hatch all latched up now, and we're getting ready for pressure-integrity check; so, why don't you go ahead?
Okay.
Mike, let us know how you're coming up there now and then.
I'm doing just fine. I've cocked eight out of the 12 docking latches, and everything is going nominally.
Okay.
All 12 docking latches are cocked.
Okay.
And I'm ready to button up the hatch.
Hey, Mike. Have you got the - got to the tunnel vent step yet?
I'm just coming to that. What can I do for you?
Well, we're waiting on you. _page : 148
Okay.
We're still ahead of the timeline, so take your time.
Okay.
Okay, I'm ready to go to LM tunnel vent.
You got it all vented now?
Negative, it's a slow process. I'm on VENT, but - it's just going to take a little while here.
Roger. Just give us a call. We're pressing on with some other stuff.
Okay.
How's our attitude holding?
Looks good.
Okay, this - this thing's supposed to take about 8 minutes; we've got about 3 of them gone, so in about another 5 minutes, I should be able to turn my thrusters back on.
Moving in.
How you doing, Mike?
Doing just fine. The - Stand by, I'll give you the DELTA-P reading - 3.0; I need 3.5 before I can turn my thrusters back on.
Okay.
I've got a 3.5 psid now; I'm going to start a maneuver here in a few minutes to depressurize it.
Okay.
How you - how you guys doing? _page : 149
Okay. We're doing our regulator checks now.
So I heard.
I'm starting the maneuver.
How long you got - to end this maneuver, Mike?
Oh, about another 2 or 3 minutes we should be there - no, less than that.
We're there; we're at the new attitude.
Okay, we're going to put our gear down.
... MASTER ARM - -
Okay.
LANDING GEAR DEPLOY, FIRE.
Here we go, Mike.
Bam, it's out. Ain't no doubt about that.
And it's gray.
Alright. Your ED LOGIC POWER A, CLOSED.
LOGIC POWER A, CLOSED.
Alright, fire it again.
Okay.
Nothing happened, huh?
Right.
Okay, now - -
I heard it click.
Yes, so did I.
That relay, I suppose. _page : 150
MASTER ARM, OFF.
It's OFF.
CB(11), ED LANDING GEAR FLAG, OPEN.
The gear went down okay, Mike.
Good deal.
Columbia -
Loud and clear.
Columbia, do you read Eagle?
Eagle, do you read Columbia?
Yes, I'm working on the high gain right now.
Okay, I'm reading him loud and clear.
You in the right attitude, Mike?
That's affirm.
Houston, Columbia. You're loud and clear.
Houston, Eagle. Over.
Buzz, you on the forward OMNI?
Houston, Eagle. Over.
Buzz, are you on the forward OMNI?
Roger. I am.
Houston, Columbia. Eagle is on the forward OMNI.
Columbia, go ahead.
Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.
Roger. I got you now. I fed in those angles for the S-band, and I couldn't get a lockon; it appears as though the antenna would have to be looking through the LM in order to reach the earth. Over.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Roger. LM weight, 33627; CSM weight, 36651; pitch trim, 00470; roll trim, 00589. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Columbia. Do you read?
Roger. S-BAND VOICE to VOICE. How do you read now?
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia in DOWN VOICE BACKUP. Do you read?
Affirmative. Columbia in DOWN VOICE BACKUP. How do you read me?
Roger. Eagle's in VOICE mode. How do you read? Over.
Houston, Columbia's in OMNI C, Charlie, DOWN VOICE BACKUP and, when you get a chance, could you look up the coordinates of 130 for me, please? I have conflicting information between my cue card and my flight plan. I'd like to know which coordinates you want me to use.
Houston, Eagle. Completed gear extension okay.
Thank you, Houston.
Yes, I had the coordinates loaded off the cue card which is - for crater 130.
Roger. Thank you.
Roger. We're just sitting around waiting for something to do. We need a state vector, a REFSMMAT before we can proceed on with the AGS, and we need you to watch our DAP data load, gimbal drive check, and throttle test. Over.
Roger. We'll go ahead with the DAP and the throttle check since we don't have a gimbal drive test, okay?
Houston, Columbia. Those T1 and T2 times are still good, aren't they?
I say, the T1 and T2 times remain unchanged, affirmative?
Thank you.
Houston, Eagle.
Roger. In accordance with the - page 47, step 1, we had the guidance control in PGNS and MODE CONTROL, PGNS, AUTO; and, of course, the circuit breakers are not in on the thrusters yet, so when we started through the DAP and proceeded on NOUN 46 - and we're looking at NOUN 47 now - why, we got an RCS TCA light, and we've got four out of the eight other bright-colored red flags. I think that this is explained by the fact that we are in - PGNS and AUTO and just unable to fire the thrusters. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Eagle. Are you going to need the high gain before you can look at our GDA position indicators?
I can go to a high ...
I can give you HIGH BIT RATE on the OMNI's if that will help you any.
Roger. Understand.
Boy, you just can't miss those checkpoints – those Diamondback and Sidewinder.
AUTO optics is pointed just a little bit north of crater 130; pointing north. _page : 153
Houston, Eagle. We're ready to pressurize the RCS. Over.
Roger.
That's affirmative; the landing gear is out and gray.
Houston, Columbia. I've completed my marks. I've gone ACCEL COMMAND in all three axes to prevent that thruster firing that last time.
Houston, Columbia. As soon as you have the necessary data on the downlink, let me know and I'll proceed.
Stand by, please.
I will.
Roger.
Roger. Looks good.
Ready to copy.
Roger. 224, plus 60267; 225, plus 58148; 226, plus 70312; 227, minus 50031. Over.
Eagle, Columbia. My P22 is complete. I'm continuing this maneuver to AGS CAL attitude.
Roger.
Roger. Columbia, Eagle. Have you about maneuvered there, yet?
Negative.
Houston, Eagle. Are those angles for after the maneuver that Columbia is going to make or are they for right now? Over.
We have about another 120 degrees to go, Buzz.
Houston, Eagle. I believe I've got you on the high-gain antenna now in HIGH BIT RATE. Over. _page : 154
You've got P00 and DATA.
Columbia.
Columbia, out.
All Columbia systems looking good.
It's nice and quiet over here, isn't it?
Eagle, you read Columbia?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Okay, everything's going well. Everything's quiet over on this side.
You bet.
Okay. I'm standing by to record your data anytime it's convenient for you; angles coming up in another 2 minutes.
Okay, I'm ready to go to B DATA now.
Roger and out.
Columbia, Eagle. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear, Buzz.
Very good.
...
Mike, are you in AGS CAL attitude now?
That's affirm. I'm holding you there with the DAP, getting the deadband. When you get ready to do the AGS CAL, I will sort of quiet down the thruster firing and then hope to stop it altogether, but I don't even think that'll get it.
Okay. Well, I'm just about ready to do that. Whenever you're ready to let it go free, why just tell me. _page : 155
Okay, it looks real quiet now; I'm ready to go right now.
Buzz, you copy?
Buzz, you copy?
Okay, Mike. Thanks.
Now, ... might check me on this, I - it's - I'm ready to go anytime you're ready.
Roger. We'll be ready to go in just a minute.
Okay, I'm starting my 5-minute rate - right now.
As a matter of interest, I appear to be drifting in my roll; I'm holding my pitch and yaw pretty constant, and I'm staying a good 15 degrees late in the program.
Roger.
Looks like a ...
Halfway through it, it looks like I have ... degrees in roll is about all.
Yes, those look like good ones right now.
Mike, what's your SEP time?
A few minutes.
GET of the separation burn is 100:39:50 even.
I haven't gotten the updates for undocking time; I'm still carrying 100 hours 15 minutes, I guess, ...
I'm surprised they didn't update it by 3 or 4 minutes to, you know, make that DELTA-V be in the same position that they wanted.
Yes, I agree. _page : 156
So we're about 3 minutes ahead of the printed flight plan; it might be wise to try to SEP about 3 minutes early, and we can give them a GET of SEP that's precise whenever they want it.
I have 5 minutes and 15 seconds since we started. Attitude is holding very well.
Roger, Mike. Just hold it a little bit longer.
No sweat, I can hold it all day. Take your sweet time. How's the Czar over there? He's so quiet.
Just hanging on - and punching.
I didn't know ... radio. ... I've ever seen a radio. All I can say is, "Beware the revolution."
You cats take it easy on the lunar surface; if I hear you huffing and puffing, I'm going to start bitching at you.
Okay, Mike.
I just pressurized the DPS. ... looks okay, Mike.
Roger that.
Hey, Mike, can you see where our radar's pointing now?
Well, it looks like it's pointed right at my head; that's hard south; so's your radio beacon.
Okay. It should really - it should be pointing from the - you know, our forward axis? It should be pointing up at 40 degrees and, you know -
Okay. We've wandered back over the bellyband now - let me assure that AGS CAL.
...
How'd the AGS CAL work out?
Oh, it danced around a little bit, but seemed to go right back to the original numbers. _page : 157
Okay. I'm going to start a maneuver now to our undocking attitude.
Now the undock attitude and the SEP attitude ought to be the same, so I'm going to go to what they gave me for the updated separation-burn attitude. That's just about 7 degrees off, but it's in your flight plan for the undock attitude.
Okay.
When your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.
Excuse me, Mike, what did you say?
I say, when your rendezvous radar self-test is complete, let me know and I'll check out my transponder.
Yes, we're through with that now.
Thank you. I'm maneuvering the ...
That transponder checked out. I hope they've got a nice, big, strong ... for you.
Very good.
Hey, Mike, what would you recommend as a good setting on the 16 millimeter?
Well, what they recommend for you is f:8 at 1/250th and put it not on infinity, but on 7 feet, which covers all the way from infinity down to a very short distance to keep it in focus, and 6 frames per second, I guess.
Yes, what you say, f:8 at 1/250th?
Yes, f:8 at 1/250th. And after you get it all set up, check that f-stop again because it slides and slips off with very little twist.
How about using, as an undocking time, 100 hours and 12 minutes? That suit your fancy? _page : 158
That'll be fine.
Okay.
What have you got for AOS, Mike?
I have 100 hours and 16 minutes.
Okay.
We got just about a minute to go; you guys all set?
Yes, I think we're about ready.
We're all set when you are, Mike.
15 seconds.
Okay, there you go. Beautiful!
...
Looks like a good SEP.
Looks good to me.
Okay. I've killed my rate, Mike, so you drift out to the distance you like and then stop your rate.
Starting my yaw.
There's sure a better visual in the simulator.
Okay. I picked up a little roll; I'm going to get rid of it.
Okay with you if I start my pitch, or you think you're not far enough away yet, Mike?
I'd prefer you stand by just a couple of seconds, Neil.
Okay. I'll wait for when you're ready – when you think you've got your rates killed perfectly. _page : 159
Okay. I'm still holding ...
...
Okay, looks pretty good to me now.
Okay.
Just like in the simulator, you're drifting off to one side and down below a little bit.
Yes.
The gear are looking good; I've seen three of them.
The MESA is not down, right?
Say again.
The MESA's still up?
Yes,
Good.
Now, you're looking good.
Roger. Eagle's undocked. The Eagle has wings. Looking good.
Okay. You've got it, P00 and DATA.
You check our tracking light, Mike?
It came on.
Camera's working beautifully.
Track off?
It's off.
I'm ready to start my yaw maneuver if it suits you, Mike. _page : 160
Does it look like you're going to be able to do this without firing any thrusters, Mike?
I'd have to fire laterally once or twice.
Very small.
Go ahead, Houston. Eagle is ready to copy.
Go ahead.
That's affirmative. Go ahead with the PDI.
Roger. Back to BLOCK and DOI: 101:36:14.07; minus 0075.8, plus all zeros, plus 0009.8; 0057.2, plus 0008.5, 0076.4, 0:3O; 000, 293; minus 0075.9, plus all zeros, plus 0009.0; NA. Over.
Okay, PDI pad: 102:33:04.36; 09:50; minus 0002.1; 182, 287, 000; plus 56919. PDI less than 10: 105:12:30.00. PDI abort greater than 10: 103:40:00.00, 107:11:30.00. No PDI plus 12 abort: 102:44:37.00; plus 0122.3, minus all zeros, plus 0188.9; 0152.0, plus 0011.0, 0225.0, 0:46; 000, 190; plus 0118.7, plus 0000.0, plus 0191.1; 103:31:07.00; 105:12:30.00. Over.
Neil, I'm maneuvering in roll.
Roger. I see.
Houston, Eagle. Are you copying the fairly large numbers for range and range rate in - VERB 83? And did you - you just give us a state vector that changed one of the two vehicles? Over.
Okay. That explains the difference.
You want him to go to HIGH GAIN, YAW, zero or - say again the numbers.
Okay. YAW, zero; PITCH, minus 20, on the HIGH GAIN. Columbia.
Yes, I copy that, and I'll do it just as soon as I get to it. _page : 161
Okay, he says he'll do that as soon as he gets around there.
Okay, Neil, I'm all set for the SEP burn, and we're looking good on this phasing.
Okay.
Columbia, read you loud and clear. Houston, how me?
Burn time, 30 seconds.
Okay, state vector looks relatively good. ...
Mike, how do you read?
Columbia, Eagle. How do you read?
Very good. How do you read me?
Very good. If you are ready, give the mark and we'll go to B DATA. Over.
Stand by 1. I'm ...
Are you ...?
63.
...; they look good.
Okay, let's switch to B DATA now.
Okay.
Eagle, Columbia.
Go ahead.
Columbia's ...
Eagle, Columbia. How's it going?
Mike, the burn's complete; it was on time - residuals are nulled, and AGS's free. _page : 162
Beautiful.
Eagle, Columbia.
Go ahead.
Roger. I'm ready to go back to VHF RANGING configuration. Be alright?
Roger. Let's go now to VHF RANGING.
Over and out.
Okay.
And you got VERB 76 in?
Yes, 76 is in ... locked up.
And we're ... 7.5 ...
Roger. That's just what we got, 7.6.
Okay.
P00?
8 minutes - -
We're in good shape - -
- - coming up on 8 minutes.
- - for ... - -
HIGH BIT, 8 minutes.
You don't have an 8-minute mark.
67 feet per second. Go ahead with the ...
Can't beat that. Okay, through with that?
Yes. I like it.
Hold on to the ... below. _page : 163
Okay. And I'll pull the breakers - think we can ... roll.
Yes.
Got them both?
What?
Got them both?
Yes. ...
Okay, it ...
Going to load the PDI plus 12, right?
Right.
Okay. I'm going to start pitching down to 125.
No PDI plus 12.
I have you right down ... 65 feet per second.
Sounds good.
Okay, the camera is set. And ought to be ready to do the P52.
Yes.
Not going to be much of a drift check.
It - it torques them late enough to ensure that - ... the drift check.
Sure seems like we're going the wrong way.
How much do we got to go to pick it up?
Got to go - oh, half the moon to go, I guess.
Coming down already.
Okay. It's got us 152; it's 151; there's ..., okay? ... _page : 164
There's 52.
Got 8 minutes ...
Now we can let us take - let it take us there.
No, wait; don't do that.
Why not?
I have to roll.
Yes, that's right.
In 2 more minutes.
Well, I did ... attitude.
Yes, you'll have to roll over; well, I guess I might as well do that.
Where's your watch? Got your stopwatch?
Got it in my pocket.
Well, the ... us over, huh?
...
And, one thing I'd appreciate if you could – see if you could - find the -
What?
The map.
Yes. Which one do you want? I've got - -
...
That it? Where do you want it?
Trade you that for a piece of gum. There it is.
...
When do we have to get these? Alright, go on. _page : 165
What do you mean by bringing - bringing CSM trash in here?
Well, that's stuff I had left over in my pocket.
You want ...?
Screen ...
You in AUTO?
No, I'm not AUTO; I'll be there in just a minute.
312, it likes.
Well, we ought to proceed on that for a while.
Okay.
These clocks you can't move like you can some. Let me try and get that clock set for PDI. ... 33 ...
... updates ...
Yes, we're keeping busy down here.
Okay.
Can't change this thing, once it gets going; like in the middle of a - -
You can't?
No.
PGNS MODE CONTROL in AUTO.
Okay. Well, I can ... - the radar antenna.
No, that's the wrong circuit - that's ...
There's the sun in the COAS.
In the COAS?
In the - I mean, in the reticle. _page : 166
Alright, let me - let me do my rain dance with the DSKY here.
Okay.
Got it on?
Now I need a VERB 76. I'm right on in pitch.
You want a VERB 76? Okay, you got it.
Hmm.
How are you doing - you going to be about ready to mark?
Yes.
Say, how about you remembering the number that I read to you; don't have to write it down. Roll right just a little.
Just about ready to mark.
Go ahead.
Oh, this cottonpicking - thought I was.
Give me a ... check.
Ready?
Getting close.
Okay.
Ready?
Yes.
MARK it.
124 19, 124 19. Well, it should have been - 124 00.
Do another one? _page : 167
Yes.
Okay. I'm about ready.
Tell me when.
Ready -
MARK it.
Okay. 134 17; KEY RELEASE; PROCEED. ... it should have been - 124 01. One more. Getting closer.
Ready whenever you are.
Stand by. How's our roll?
Okay.
MARK it.
... - 13; KEY RELEASE; PROCEED. 4 13 - ... it should have been - closer yet.
Okay, Mike, we passed the star check. Foxtrot.
Very good. ...
Very good. Okay? ...
Alright, let's go to - pitch to 180, 285, and zero.
Okay. We'll ...
Cottonpicker just won't stay - try it!
Well, wait until we lose that descent stage, man.
We'd better take - a - piece of tape; hold that down.
How about if you get the bottom in the – get the bottom underneath this cover? That help? _page : 168
Well, it - it's still not; I've had it in there real good couple of times.
Your - hoses were tearing hell out of my board.
Sorry.
You got INVERTER 1 circuit breaker in, right?
Checked in.
Okay. I'm going to check INVERTER 1. INVERTER 2 is good; and INVERTER 1 is good, and we're on INVERTER.
... look good.
Okay, get your AELD circuit breaker in and ABORT STAGE circuit breaker in.
AELD is in; ABORT STAGE is in.
Cycle the CWEA? No, we must have lost one.
Yes. That cottonpicker may be trouble.
Well, we'll have to tell them about that. I don't know when it - when it went out, because we didn't get any light that I saw, did you?
I think it's just a switch. I ... if it doesn't trigger a light -
Something - -
Oh, we're in PULSE, and we're not commanding any firing - -
I don't know; that could have come under DOI, but I doubt it.
I just think that's one of those sticky flags. ... got a good engine.
Alright, let's see.
... _page : 169
ENGINE STOP button was reset?
ENGINE STOP button is START, but it is going to be now.
Alright. Window bars; THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.
Okay. THROTTLE CONTROL to AUTO.
Alright, TTCA - -
THROTTLE on MINIMUM.
- - ENABLE - ENABLE - THROTTLE in MINIMUM. Okay, in 35 minutes, we'll get the BAT feeds ON and - -
That's the wrong time, right?
No, no, no.
...? PDI?
It's - oh - about - probably maybe a second, right here, ... 32. Okay?
Yes, it's about a second off.
If it's fast, I'll stop it; if it isn't, why, forget it.
You want this one over there?
I need this out. Burn in 46 minutes.
You want this one?
Yes. I don't - think - it'll be helpful, but I'll stick it here and pull it out if I need it.
Let's see; we haven't got P20 going yet, have we?
No.
Let's do that. Let's get the RENDEZVOUS RADAR circuit breaker in. _page : 170
Okay.
IN. Might look at the DPS.
What do you hear?
... glycol pumps.
Alright.
Look at that. Oh, that must have been - ...
Okay, ascent - tank pressure - temperature's up, changed to - I don't know.
DPS's good -
Look at all that RCS we got.
That's more than we've ever had in the simulator, isn't it?
Yes.
Got your camera rigged?
The other circuit breaker? Camera's all set to go. I hope the others just don't fall out. Got them both in?
Yes.
Well, let's hope he's in mode 2.
Okay, I'm going to get the ASCENT BATS, ON. BATTERY 5, ON; looks good. BATTERY 6, ON; that's good.
Yes, we've lost it.
Well, did it go to mode 2? That's where I want it to go.
No - I can't tell.
Yes, it's going to mode 2. Hasn't it? _page : 171
Yes.
Yes. There we are. Beautiful.
Go to AUTO TRACK?
No, not yet - wait until the light goes out. Did that thing want to - Hey, I didn't know that could do that. You don't hear that, huh? (Laughter)
Hear that, too, huh?
Sounds like wind whipping around the trees.
Okay, AUTO TRACK.
Okay, we ready to go to P63?
Yes.
Okay, get a - get a - Need to compare a TIG time. 09:50. That's right.
See that Big Dipper there?
That's a big out of plane, but I don't know which way it is.
I believe minus - but they were expecting it.
Okay, four -
That's within 7 ... seconds. Okay?
Okay. These should not be in AUTO, right?
Yes. Remember that one.
180, 287, 0. Here goes.
Give me - -
You'll get them before we will.
Ready to give them a status report? DOI? _page : 172
Well, I hope it's on the right page.
Okay, I'm going to get DESCENT QUANTITY, ON, ... ON.
Okay, you want to give it - Okay, we've lost it. In AUTO now.
... RANGE RATE.
How about that?
VERB 77 and a VERB 62.
Okay, sequence camera coming on.
Should be a little ...
Roger. I think I've got you on high gain now.
Okay. Hear anything about that?
Say again the angles, though.
I'll set them in to use them before we yaw around.
Copy.
Okay. What else is left to do here?
ENGINE ARM, DESCENT. 40 seconds.
Is your camera running?
Camera's running.
Okay, ...
Okay, the OVERRIDE at 5 seconds.
DESCENT, ARMED.
ALTITUDE lights, ON? ... proceed?
Proceed. 1, 0 – _page : 173
IGNITION. 10 percent.
Just about on time.
You got the OVERRIDES ON?
OVERRIDE is ON. 24. FLASH. THROTTLE, up.
Good. Okay.
PGNS holding.
Okay, we're reading your relay to us, Mike? I'll leave it in SLEW. Relay it to us. See if they got me now; I got good signal strength on SLEW.
Okay, rate of descent looks good.
Roger. Copy.
Copy.
Okay. Coming up on 2 minutes; going good. AGS's good?
AGS and PGNS agree very closely.
RCS is good; no flag. DPS pressure is good. 1 minute.
30 feet per second. Light's on. Altitude's a little high.
Okay, we want a 10. Let's get - You want to get rid of this radar?
Yes.
To SLEW?
SLEW.
Houston, I'm getting a little fluctuation in the - AC voltage now. Just the meter, maybe, huh?
Okay, we went by the 3-minute point early. A little off. _page : 174
Rate of descent looks real good. Altitude – right about on.
Our position checks downrange show us to be a little off. AGS - AGS is showing about 2-feet-per-second greater rate of descent.
MARK.
Show us to be about - Stand by. Maybe have to stop that.
Altitude rate looks right down the groove.
Roger. About 2 seconds off - rolling over.
Okay, now watch that signal strength because -
Yes, I think it's going to drop.
Boy, I tell you, this is much harder to do than it was -
Keep it going.
Houston, before we leave you, the ED BATS are GO at 4 minutes.
Roger.
How you look over there? Okay?
Okay. You got good lockon.
We got a lockon?
Yes. Altitude light's out.
Okay.
DELTA-H is minus 2900. We got the earth right out our front window.
Sure enough. _page : 175
Houston, you're looking at our DELTA-H. Program alarm.
1202; 1202.
What is it?
That's in core ...
Give us a reading on the 1202 program alarm.
Roger. 330. Okay, looks like about 820. Roger. Copy. 6 foot ...
Same alarm and it appears to come up when we have a 16 68 up.
Were we - were - was it coming down?
Yes, it's coming down beautifully.
Roger; it looks good now.
THROTTLE, DOWN.
THROTTLE, DOWN, on time.
You can feel it in here when the throttle's down; better than the simulator.
AGS and PGNS look real close.
Okay. No flags. RCS is GO; DPS is GO; pressure is - okay.
Okay, I'm still on SLEW, so we may tend to lose as we gradually pitch over; let me try AUTO again now, and see what happens. Okay, looks like it's holding.
Okay. 07:30 coming up. Should be ...
...
And I have the window. I have that - view – out the window - Going to ... _page : 176
Coming up on 8 minutes.
Could you give us an estimated switchover time, please, Houston?
Okay, 7000, ... Looks good.
Roger.
P64.
... over. Okay. 5000, 100 feet per second is good, and I'm going to check my attitude control.
Attitude control is good - manual attitude control is good. Okay, 3070.
Roger; understand. Go for landing, 3000 feet. Program alarm - 1201.
1201. Okay. 2050.
2000 feet; 2000 feet.
Give me an LPD.
Into the AGS, 47 degrees.
Give me an LPD.
47 degrees.
47.
That's not a bad-looking area. Okay.
1030 is good.
What's LPD?
35 degrees, 35 degrees; 750, ... coming down to 23.
Okay. _page : 177
700, 21 down, 33 degrees.
Pretty rocky area.

Okay.
Okay, 400 feet, down to 9, 58 forward.
...
350 feet, down at 4 - 330 – 6-1/2 down. We're pegged on ... velocity.
300 feet down, 3-1/2, 47 forward. Coming up - 1 a minute, 1-1/2 down. Moving out.
270.
Okay, how's the fuel?
Wait just a minute.
Okay, Ed, this looks like a good area here.
I got the shadow out there. 250, down at 2-1/2, 19 forward.
Altitude velocity light, 3-1/2 down, 220 feet; 13 forward, 11 forward, coming down nicely. 200 feet - -
... - -
5-1/2 down, 5-1/2 down.
I got to get ...
160 feet, 6-1/2 down - 5-1/2 down, 9 forward. Still looks good. 120 feet.
100 feet, 3-1/2 down, 9 forward. 5 percent - ...
Okay. _page : 178
Okay, 75 feet. And it's looking good; down a half. 6 forward; light's on. 6 - 60 feet down, 2-1/2, 2 forward, 2 forward.
Looks good. 40 feet down, 2-1/2. Picking up some dust. 30 feet, 2-1/2 down - straight down; 4 forward, 4 forward, drifting to the right a little.
20 feet, down a half; drifting forward just a little bit. Good. Okay.
SHUTDOWN.
Okay. ENGINE STOP; ACA out of DETENT.
Out of DETENT.
AUTO MODE CONTROL, both AUTO; DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, OFF; ENGINE ARM, OFF; 413 is in.
ENGINE ARM is OFF.
Houston - Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.
Thank you.
Okay. Let's go on. Okay, we're going to be busy for a minute.
Alright, MASTER ARM, ON. Take care of the descent vent.
MASTER ARM coming OFF.
I'll get the pressure vent.
Okay.
Very smooth touchdown.
I didn't hear that vent going - -
... oxidizer. _page : 179
... vent.
Houston, how do you reed Columbia on the high gain?
Okay, Houston. On DESCENT 1, the fuel and oxidizer are reading 10 psi; on DESCENT 2, fuel is reading 10 psi; oxidizer, 11 psi.
Okay, going back to OFF.
... is OPEN. Yes, ...
Alright, we need the -
Houston, Tranquility Base is ready to go through the powerdown and terminate the simulated countdown.
Hope he is, too.
OPEN.
Okay, the operations HEATER circuit breaker is OPEN.
Roger. It's in progress. Anytime, take your helmet off.
Roger. Couldn't have had better treatment from all of you back there.
Houston, Columbia. Copy NOUN 49?
Roger.
Yes, stand by 1, Charlie, for the next ...
Well, the area looks smooth, but I was unable to see them. I just picked out a distinguishable crater nearby and marked on it.
It looks like a nice area, though.
Houston, Columbia. I say again: I did not see them. AUTO optics pointed at a spot very close to the coordinates which you gave me, so I picked out a tiny crater in that area and marked on it, so that I'll be able to have repeatable data, but I was still unable to see them.
Houston, Columbia. I'm coming up on my time for the first pass when I may be able to see the LM. Do you have any topographical cue that might help me out here on - AUTO optics is tracking between two craters. One of them, as the LM sees it, would be long at 11 o'clock; the other would be short and behind him at 5 o'clock. They're great big old craters - depressions.
Roger, Houston. Columbia ... up. I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time, hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.
It's going past now, Bruce, but I scanned that area that you are talking about very closely, and no, I did not see them.
Go ahead.
Stand by 1.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Columbia on the high gain.
Read you loud and clear, Bruce. What's new?
Ready to copy.
Columbia.
Houston, Columbia on the high gain. Over.
I'm reading you loud and clear. How's it going?
Columbia. Roger. _page : 181
Negative that.
Houston, Columbia on ... How do you read?
Roger; Columbia OMNI Charlie. How do you read?
Hallelujah.
Roger, understand. You want a option 1 - P52, option 1?
P52.
Roger, Houston. Columbia's reading you.
Roger. Stand by.
Ready to copy.
Houston, Columbia.
Negative, Bruce. Just give me your latitude - longitude over 2, altitude, and the grid squares. Never mind the other; you're broken up.
Well, that is, if you have the new information; otherwise, I'll just use the old numbers.
Okay.
Houston, Columbia. You got the new coordinates?
Roger. Have you got the new coordinates for me?
Roger. Thank you.
Okay.
Okay. I read back plus 00692, plus 11713, and minus 00144. And you have a grid square for me?
Kilo 0.9 and 6.3. Thank you. One of these grid squares is about as much as you can scan on a single pass.
Roger. _page : 182
Okay.
Houston, Columbia ...
Roger. I can't see them.
Roger. ...
Roger. I need a very precise position because I can only do a decent Job of scanning maybe one of those grid squares at a time. The area that we've been sweeping covers 10's and 20's and 30's of them.
Roger. How's the fuel coming?
Roger. Well, I'll continue this maneuver then to roll 82, pitch 218, yaw zero, if that's okay with you, and do a P52 in that attitude. And that'll be a ... _page : 183
Thank you kindly, Jim.
Glad to have all you big roomful of people looking over our shoulder.
Houston, Columbia on OMNI D, Delta. Over.
Go ahead.
BAT 2 and 4 coming OFF.
Okay, OFF.

Yes.
Okay.
DSKY blanks.
Got that ascent card?
This one? Place to put it? _page : 185
Yes. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 - ABORT STAGE; ENGINE ARM, ASCENT - Proceed.
We're off; look at that stuff go all over the place.
Look at that shadow. Beautiful! 26 - 36 feet per second up - -
The Eagle is - -

BALANCE COUPLE, OFF. Very quiet ride. There's that ... sticking out now.
... See if you can see the - Cat's Paw.
It's all the way out in front of us in that -
Roger. Can't see it.
Do you see the Cat's Paw?
No.
This might be it.
Roger. Yes, I think it is.
It's a very quiet ride, just a little bit of slow wallowing back and forth - not very much thruster activity.
700, 150 up; beautiful. 9000. PGNS and AGS agree within a foot per second.
Pressures are good.
2 minutes the time; 170 is beautiful, 14 000.
Within a foot per second again, AGS to PGNS.
S-band looks like it's holding good - 1500, 182. _page : 186
Roger.
Right on H-dot. Coming up here - -
Looks like the velocity is sort of - -
- - this is H-DOT MAX now.
- - ... right here. Okay.
Going right down - going right down U.S. 1.
T minus 4 minutes - ... a little fast - we got altitude rate - -
Now we got - got Sabine off to our right, now.
Coming up on Schmidt here pretty soon, huh?
02:40 to go.
Everything's fine.
Okay, there's Ritter out there. See him, there it is, right there - and there's Schmidt. Man, that's impressive looking, isn't it?
I can't see it. Oh, yes, now I can just get a glimpse.
5 minutes, 33 - G&N, 54 -
Looking good here. It's a spectacular ride.
... off to the right.
6 minutes.
Looks like ... off a little here.
Roger. Good agreement in DELTA-V to go in both AGS and PGNS.
... three ...
Alright, 800 to go. _page : 187
Okay.
700 to go. Okay, now open up the main shutoff.
ASCENT FEED's, CLOSED, pressure's holding good; CROSS FEED, ON.

Okay, I'm getting ready for ARM, OFF.
Ready?
ARM, OFF.
OFF. 50 -
We got 5337.3 and 32.8 feet per second, 60 666.
... up?
And we got - we got our residuals.
Okay - take those out, right?
Yes, take -
...
We're working on it.
I can't check that - residual.
That's good.
Okay, that sounds a little - little on the high side.
Okay.
Okay, Houston, we show 47.3 by 9.5.
The AGS has 9.5 - 46.6. _page : 188
Okay.
...
Roger.
You want to try ...?
Yes.
Circuit breakers in - or do you want to go to align?
Maybe we'd better get an alignment - ...
Okay. ...
Yes.
Roger, Houston. The Eagle is back in orbit, having left Tranquility Base and leaving behind a replica from our Apollo 11 patch and the olive branch.
We had a lot of help down there.
We're going to have to have our rendezvous radar circuit breakers in anyway to get onto your link.
Yes.
Okay.
Okay.
INVERTER 2, INVERTER 1, circuit breaker open?
I got INVERTER 1.
Close the AOT LAMP circuit breaker -
Going to TRACK here.
Yes.
That right? _page : 189
Right.
You know, I didn't see a lot of dust in the cockpit, did you?
No, there was a fair amount. What did you get, 283?
Yes.
...
Okay.
No. We'll wait until CDH.
Okay, thank you.
Okay.
No, I didn't; go ahead, Mike.
I think we are now, finally, and I think I have you in sight.
We have 51 5.
Well, the ground's got 51 5, and we got 51 5. Yes. First time we've ever agreed on anything.
Want these ... first?
Not yet.
I don't know why.
I had to turn my S-band off so I could hear him - my S-band switch on the audio panel. Woo-woo!
Yes, that works good.
Not at this point, no.
Okay.
... Hey, Mike, how do you read me? _page : 190
Okay, let's go to B DATA on your command.
Eagle, Columbia.
Loud and clear.
Affirmative; we're at the burn attitude, too.
Eagle, Columbia. When you get a chance, could you give me the - the CSI P76 pad and your NOUN 84 and your NOUN 33?
Yes, we'll do that in a minute.
Alright.
Okay, Mike, you want the burn time and the NOUN 81; is that right?
Okay, the burn time is 125:19:34.7, and the burn is 51.5, zero, and zero.
Okay, I understand. Plus 51.5, zeros, and zeros, and you're using 125:19:34.70. Thank you kindly.
I'm in maneuver attitude, all set to burn if necessary. I've got about 45 minutes to TIG - 45 seconds to TIG.
Okay.
We're burning, Mike.
Burn complete, Mike.
Good show.
Okay, Mike, our CDH time is 126:17:45.58. Over.
Roger; copy. CDH, 126:17:45.58.
Affirmative.
Eagle, Columbia. I have you in an orbit 49.5 by 46.1.
Okay, thank you. _page : 191
Eagle, Columbia. I'd like to go back to VHF RANGING configuration, please, on your mark.
Roger. On my mark -
MARK, VHF RANGING.
...
Well, which way did I go?
... out of plane.
What?
Did you hear that?
Why you don't hear these 3 – 3500-pound rocket engines when you're sitting on them, I'll never know.
Yes.
... structure somehow.
3.5, Neil.
Woo-woos is on VHF B -
... B?
Not on A.
(Laughter) That's your story, huh?
That's rugged country.
Yes, that perigee we're on ...
... alright, isn't it?
I got 4 feet forward and I got back 7 ...
Boy, this water separator sure isn't working worth a durn. Maybe we ought to try the other one - ... water. Oh boy, this thing is just really spitting it. _page : 192
I sure do; it's been on - yes, we do - it's been on all the time.
We should see the tracking light now - That's it - Doesn't look ... but it's not - turned off.
Okay, let's try and get a Y-dot, or an R-dot, at 30 seconds.
It'll be the first time we've ever done it.
No, let me get COMM.
We're really going to be crying.
[Simulated crying]
My - top thruster over here has got a lot of brown holes in it - in the exit nozzle.
See it?
Yes.
You know, these thrusters aren't used much over here. Well, maybe ... or something.
See it?
No.
When we get the sun behind us, we might be able to.
Hey, I got to recycle. Then after ...
It's all over me.
Coming out of that vent back of my neck, isn't it? That where it's coming out?
Give us the CSI state vector - navigation difference - no updating CSI ...
Through AGS.
... _page : 193
Thinking about it.
You going to come up with a solution for us?
Range rate?
Range rate.
A lot of trouble having our ... up.
Range/range rate is ...
Yaw, damn it!
...
... is up.
125:47:45.58.
...
... feet per second.
Both tanks were pressurized, weren't they?
Yes.
Sure shook them up. I remember that Gene said theirs didn't drop a bit - remember that – when they pressurized? Don't think theirs dropped at all.
Okay.
We're getting minus 2.9.
Going AGS all the way, huh?
Yes, forget it.
Get more tracking if we forget.
No, we'll just - we'll just wait until CDH.
You got a lot of film left in there? _page : 194
About half.
You could run it some here. Oh, you just – you want to leave some for docking, huh?
... Got that cockpit all cleaned up so that we got places for all our trash, Mike?
...
Yes, we got them all over us - look like chimney sweeps.
You bet you. Nice to get home.
... up tracking -
Got that?
What do you need?
That right-angle bracket, the right-angle bracket, need that -
It's not over here. Well, that's a good day not to throw in some failures. See if we can run the nominal one time.
CO2.
I don't think so, Mike, we got to - ...
... want to go to that - ...
Stand by for ...
Right, that's what we've got.
...
Coming up on 1 minute to TIG. Neil, how's it looking?
Pretty good.
That last out of plane was in the AGS, not the radar. _page : 195
Alright.
...
Okay.
Ready to burn?
Okay.
We're burning.
Okay, that's it.
Burn complete?
Burn's complete. Did you read? Burn's complete.
Thank you.
Eagle, Houston. Aft OMNI, LOW BIT RATE, and we'll see you at 127 plus 51.
Okay, ... ... 5, huh?
Well - say when ... Oh, wait a minute.
Chart at 26/7 forward for -
Pretty reasonable.
AGS had these residuals after its completion after the burn.
I can't see you, Michael.
... moving in at ...
Okay. I got good radar; I just can't see you.
...
Do you think that pressure dropped?
Yes. _page : 196
It doesn't show up in the ... books. I don't see any reason why we don't take them all back. All that we've got - -
All got data.
We all got something ...
Okay, you try getting it - ...?
No, I haven't been; do you want me to?
No, I got to keep the chart.
... can take this update for them.
On the track about, huh?
Boy, my shoulders sure hurt.
Mine are, too.
Last night I couldn't get this far from the ...
I was the same way.
Use all the green tape, did you?
I got it in sight now, Mike.
...
...
Okay.
(Yawn)
...
Yes, so do we.
A hundred and what?
...
Okay, NOUN 81, minus 0, plus 0.4, plus 0.9.
And now, plus 0.4, plus 0.9. ... _page : 197
And 15 minutes after TPI, I've got - -
...
M-1.
...
... your burn's a little late.
... be burning - ...
Okay, ... the ... on? There it is.
Neil, I guarantee you that the burn is precise, okay?
...
Good.
... good burn ...
No, it's not going to be late. Maybe 5 seconds.
Burn complete.
Thank you.
Well, it's all over but the docking.
Check the start out there.
Okay.
...
You still got him?
Yes. I probably won't when the sun gets in my telescope.
... ... hold the ...
Now I can't see - -
The what? _page : 198
Won't hold the ...
... going right down the ... and it sure has been nice.
Okay. I just got sight of you in the sunlight here.
Okay.
Oh, I've got him.
...
I've got him now, too.
Sure enough.
Well, I see you don't have any landing gear.
That's good.
...
You're not confused on which end to dock with, are you?
...
Okay, Mike, if there's some data bags around there - I may have one or two in my temporary stowage - why, we may want them in addition to the other regular bags, so we can put some of this data back in it.
In the data bags?
Yes, there are a couple of different LM bags that I left in there.
Okay, well, why don't we ... back over there and ...?
Right.
... bring the bag ...
Could be. _page : 199
Alright.
Okay, ... have a plastic one and a ...
Bring the ... back.
I think we'll make it (laughter).
Don't tell that to poor ..., though (laughter).
...
We'll see you at ...
Okay.
One of those two bright spots is bound to be Mike.
How about picking the closest one?
Good idea.
... this light?
Is that alright?
Okay, at 49 000 feet, we're supposed to be 65 feet per second - our little old chart says. And our LOS rate's supposed to be about O.1; it's about point - -
...
Okay.
...
Right - that's ...
12 on here, right?
Not exactly.
Not exactly?
You're a little less. You're 10 seconds less in ... About that ... _page : 200
Look's like you're making a high ... on us, Michael.
Yes, ...
... let me move in just a ...
No, we aren't that - confident.
...?
We've got about 54.
You got ... to ...?
Huh?
The ...?
Yes. ...
Let's try this midcourse out.
Right. Okay, it's ...
...
Is that right, I hope?
Yes.
It should be 70.
Okay, I can see the shape of your vehicle now, Mike.
Oh, yes - got your high gain in sight; your tracking light - whole vehicle shows. I see that you're pointed at me. Now, you're turning a little bit - great.
...
Are you burning yet?
We're burning.
... _page : 201
Good enough.
Seems like when you get down to around 110, you just keep chasing him. You put it in – stick it in one axis, and it goes through - out of another, especially when ... stays about the same.
If it's ..., it's definite.
Okay, now, let's see; we want to change the DAP - that what we want to do?
Yes.
I need a P76 now, Buzz.
Okay, you got the time for the burn; NOUN 81 was plus 0.1, plus 1.2, plus 0.5.
...
... plus ...
Okay. ... 45 -
8.2 miles, 40 feet per second.
You can have your place now.
...
Okay.
Can you see our tracking light, now?
... but you're in between my sextant and my COAS.
Where'd you put the ...?
My what?
Your ... for ...
It's in the bottom over ...
... pick me up ...
I got you. _page : 202
Okay. Don't ... other spacecraft.
No, I'm not going to lose you, brother.
What have you got for ...? ... I have 6.8 and 9 miles, ... out. Oh, that checks.
Got ... up? I thought I made it pretty clear.
Not as sporty a ... as we thought, huh?
That wasn't - bad at all; the alignment was - pretty dicey.
Yes, sir.
That was just luck (laughter).
I hope you ...
I'll be glad to get to the ...
Yes, but I hate to ...; will you get ...?
Okay.
Oh, it'll come off, I guess - ...
These screws here - -
Alright, there's a couple of bolts - -
- - these screws here might do it.
- - there's a couple of bolts down there that have come loose - if I remember. ... I'll get them.
I'm slowly closing at 32 feet per second and a mile and a half.
Okay, I've got a mile and a half and 32-1/2.
...
Take ...
Yes, I guess it'll take us another - 6 minutes or something like that. _page : 203
Yes.
... we got 15 ...
...
Okay.
That's going to hit the braking gate right on the schedule.
Yes.
Okay, let's put P47 in.
I don't know why I lost my - I'm at - oh, did you - you lost your transponder, Mike - I think.
... pitch up a bit.
I wish you would.
I have 0.7 mile and I got you at 31 feet per second, ... look good.
Okay, ...
...?
Okay, we're getting it.
... -
Are you ... forward now?
Yes - yes, we're in good shape, Mike; we're braking.
Okay.
...
Flying all over us.
Okay, we're about 11 feet a second coming in at you
... _page : 204
That's good. What ... are you in?
Hope we're not going to get a pitch straight down.
We've got a - pitchdown and then a yaw to do - ...
...
Looks good.
I'm sure you're going to get ..., I'll tell you that.
It flies good, though.
...?
Okay, now, if I pitch over, I'm going to be looking right into the sun.
...
Hope you know how to roll.
Yes, I do. I ...
You want to end up with that window – opposite his right window so you don't want to roll right. Right?
Yes.
The only trouble is, it's towards - towards 90, isn't it?
You could - you -
If I roll 120 - it'll roll left
90, huh? ... 60?
Well, why don't I start to roll - -
Yes, I think if you roll up 60 – _page : 205
I'll be looking into his left window when I pitch up.
I don't think so. If you did it right now you'd - -
... I got the earth coming up already; it's fantastic!
Okay, you got me.
Eagle and Columbia, Houston. Standing by.
Roger; we're stationkeeping.
Roger.
Pitch up ... pass right up just a little, you got a better view - bottom side - ... - move back.
... - that's right.
Okay. I'm getting about into the right attitude, I think. ...
Yes.
That roll's pretty far; I don't know just how much - so that's - Oh, it's going to go BLOCK!
That's it - going to AGS?
Yes, ... ATT DEADBAND.
Okay, Mike, I'll get - try to get in position here, and then you got it.
Okay.
How does the roll attitude look?
...
Let's see how the DSKY thinks it looks.
Have you stopped rolling yet? _page : 206
I'll stop. Matter of fact, I can stop right here, if you like that.
Need a little bit more. That's the way; keep it going. Need a little more ... That's the way, keep going - go a little bit more - go ahead - go ahead - okay, stop. Okay, I got it now.
You got the ... in ...?
Yes. Right there. Okay, ... 1 -
Well, we might need to at least have a platform ...
Yes.
Okay, now, Neil, when you feel us contact, you're going to turn ... seconds, is that right?
That's right.
Okay, Buzz.
We got a platform to make.
Okay.
I'm not going to do a thing, Mike; I'm just letting her hold in ATTITUDE HOLD.
Okay.
I think we ought to be at 4 JETS for this, ... AGS.
HOLD.
...
He's about 15 feet out now.
Okay, I'd better try out the radar.
Don't you want to beef up that radar?
Yes. _page : 207
Good.
Ready to pull the circuit breakers?
Okay. You ready?
Yes.
They're pulled.
He's 10 feet. About 5 feet, I guess.
Looks good, Mike.
Okay, they're pulled.
Pull it out.
Okay. Circuit breakers - -
Now, here are a couple of bags - and I think it's self-explanatory what goes in them.
Yes.
... water.
Now, where are those things?
They're at the over ...
Maybe I could slide out of here ...
Hey, Michael, you all tied up there?
...
Get ready for those million-dollar boxes. Got a lot of weight; now, watch it.
You intend to keep ...?
Yes.
That's all your input, are you sure?
Yes. _page : 208
Okay.
Use what?
Use lithium hydroxide.
That thing still doesn't fit. No, they didn't fix it.
Huh?
They didn't fix it. I had thought somebody had mentioned it, at least.
...
What?
...
Get some tape.
Yes.
Still got some here?
Yes.
...
Okay.
Do you want to vacuum off any of those – those ... spills or anything?
Well, that's ...
Oh, the tape, I guess.
Want tape?
Yes, please.
Here you are.
About how many pictures did you take with – the closeup camera? _page : 209
I don't know; 30 maybe, 40?
I hope I took the thing apart correctly.
Push the cutter bar down first?
Yes.
It's all right, then.
How are you doing?
Can't hear you.
(Laughter) Well, that stuff can't ... tell; think of Bobby ...
Say, you did get a couple of hard ones in there, didn't you?
Yes.
I guess we leave this here or do you want to take it up?
I'd leave that here.
That might be a little hard to explain.
Yes.
Hey, Neil?
Yes?
...
Okay.
... get rid of this ...
Okay. If you want to have a look at what the moon looks like, you can open that up and look. Don't open the bag, though.
... _page : 210
You'd never have guessed, huh? (Laughter)
What did you do with that checklist?
It's back yonder.
What?
It's behind the hatch.
What was that bag ...?
Contingency sample.
Rock?
Yes, there's some rocks in it, too. You can feel them, but you can't see them; they're covered with that - graphite.
... compared to -
Looks like powdered graphite to me.
Say, you got a screwdriver, Mike?
Yes.
Yes?
Yes, I guess I have; just a second.
You know, that - that one's just a bunch of trash that we want to take back – LM parts, odds and ends, and it won't stay closed by itself; we'll have to figure something out for it.
Ouch! Alright, here's your checklist.
You vacuum all this stuff?
Which?
Gloves, lunar stuff?
... _page : 211
Okay. It looks to me like - what we're going to do is vacuum you out and get you out of here. I'll - throw the switches down there.
How about the data bag?
No, I need this bag.
Well, I've got one here. I'll go try to get some more - when I go over. Okay?
Okay. Give me the vacuum tube.
Let me get my back to you first.
Need a PPK.
Huh? I guess they're in here. PPK's?
I guess they're over here.
..., you know? (Laughter)
Get your circuit breakers pushed, AUDIO control circuit breakers?
...
How are you doing?
It's filthy.
Does all this stuff come in here?
Well, I guess that ought to do it.
Okay.
...
Yes.
...
Just a minute.
Say, I need some of those data books. _page : 212
Where did you put the book? Where did you put the first one? In here? Okay.
...
No, we can leave those two here. No, I don't want either of those two. No, I think the others might be -
... we leave these bags here.
Okay.
Hey, have you been over it, Mike?
... really ...
How about calling them and asking them for – if those angles are still good? Right at lock-lock with them?
... last time ...
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.
...
It's not, but I'll get it off.
Okay.
Roger. We were seeing - believe it or not, we were seeing some funnies on the Eagle's rendezvous radar - -
What do you do with it?
- - and that was the only theory that we had - it looked like it was a good one.
Hey - what do you do with it?
Just turn it down to off.
This goes off - -
No, no, no, no, that's not the one - it's this switch right next to that IMU - - _page : 213
Oh.
- - Buzz. Okay, that one, just turn it to – turn it to position 1 - extreme left; that one. There you go. Thank you.
I thought you were going to be doing VHF RANGING on the darn thing because we had it set up for - VHF ...
I don't know where ... other than that.
That was to - -
You ought to check the flight plan, it doesn't mention the (laughter) probe or the drogue. It says I remove my hatch, and then I notify you that you're clear to open your hatch.
Huh?
Oh, no.
So, that's just the contingency.
No, negative.
That's the contingency.
We move the drogue there. ...
We've got to reach down and grab that extension handle and all that good stuff.
That was alright, we understand.
Yes.
Damn! My ears hurt from wearing this thing.
How are the earpieces - inside ...
...
...
Yes, I hate those damn ... _page : 214
Yes, they're not - ...
Yes. I believe - Did you hear any noise during - you didn't hear any noise during descent, did you? ...
...
How about during lift-off?
...
How was lift-off? How did lift-off feel?
Well, there was a little - little blast – then we started moving; then we could see all those - -
... were you very stable; I mean, you just sort of floated up or was there a bunch of rattling around?
- - The floor came up to meet you. I think it multiplied g by ... - it was about - at lift-off - maybe - half a g or two-thirds of a g.
Well, you know, - well, just looking at that one sample, it was - I'm surprised you didn't have a lot more dust. Now you saw dust during descent, I think, around 40 feet, something like that, 30 feet maybe.
Yes it was - -
But it's pattern is such that it sprays out horizontally, and it doesn't really come up and engulf you, huh?
All the stuff looks like very light tan and gray, you know, that's - that's the color of it. When you get right up there to it, when you see it, why that isn't the color at all.
Dark - battleship gray, isn't it?
Maybe not - I don't know - -
Well, what kind of - - _page : 215
- - what stuck to the spacecraft, I think you can see afterwards - -
What do you think it is from the - geology standpoint, is it basalt dust?
...
Well, do the rocks - do the rocks all look the same? They're different - good, great; I'm glad to hear it.
There's really a tremendous -
Little sparkly stuff; quite a bit of it all over.
I'll be damned; I'm glad - I'm glad it wasn't just - -
...
Yes, is that right?
Luckily, you were able to get a little bit of everything. I mean, were the rocks - I mean, how did you - did you go around and - just pick up rocks, put them in - in - -
We were kind of rushed, if that's what you mean.
Yes.
...
Great, great. Yes, it's - beautiful. Man, that's beautiful. It doesn't make a dip whether ... and all that, I mean you know, they mapped the area and all that - -
Eventually, it does - -
Huh?
Well, eventually, it does - it shows the ... - you can see those - ... _page : 216
That's great; fantastic! That'll keep those geologists jumping for years.
Yes, you got to keep ... No, that's right, you got a 6-foot pole, you just stick ... - -
Sort of like wet sand - -
- - about that far.
Is that right? I don't know. I'm inclined to ...
... Is this yours?
You yawed right 13 degrees? What's nominal?
Yaw left 13 degrees.
Ah so, ah so.
I guess the main thing on this stowage is to make sure it's reasonable for the g's we'll get during TEI and sometime on the way home we can get everything all squared away for ...
No, I'm in no rush. Go ahead - go ahead and get everything all packed away; I hate to have – a couple of suits out. If you want to air it for a while, go ahead and get the hose to it, and - I'm in no rush. I'll take this thing off after you guys are done there.
...
Yes. Is that right?
You finally got it level, huh? What was that thing that you said it was supposed to be concave but it was convex?
...
Yes, yes.
... looking down there ... sure looked like it was convex ... Neil walked back a little later and it was right smack in the middle ... - - _page : 217
But there's all different kinds of rocks, huh, or at least several different kinds? Well, how - -
- - ...
Well, did - when you look - when you're walking around or just looking out the window of the LM, did it appear very homogeneous? Everything sort of the same color and all, or did it look ...?
...
It's that dark battleship gray like?
When you looked down sun, it's very tan, very tan.
...
When you looked down sun, it looks almost white, just a reflection from the sun.
Well, ... as it goes out ... while on earth it gets ... in the atmosphere ... - -
Yes.
- - ... that might be indicative of why ... - -
Yes.
Neil, when you get a hand, would you push that little goddam valve down to DUMP? Never mind, never mind.
... be sure and get the right one ... - -
It's the lower valve on the lower panel – lower left; that guy right there. Yes, that guy right there; put him down to DUMP. Dump's easy, fine; set the clock.
...
Here's one.
... for the hoses? Well, check the ends of the hoses. _page : 218
Well, why don't you leave the vacuum cleaner; I think you just got ... now the other one - -
No, this one's got ...
Okay. Now the one I got is for my hose over here which doesn't have -
How big are the rocks that you just scurried around and picked up with the tongs? Good gravy! Beautiful! Just crack those guys open and get a - you know, virgin interior of them in a vacuum, and they'll have a ball. ...
Hey, the Velcro - the Velcro around them sort of ...
Huh?
I said, this is my field geology ...
Right.
...
We could move - we could move that bag - it's no big thing, we can move the bag. Don't worry about it; we're going to leave it this way for TEI, right? Might as well.
...
Good day, I don't know. It's - I tell you, it's not a bad way to live, with that couch in there - I sort of - oh, yes, I agree; we can put two up and one down - ...
...
Yes, we could put the couch up now if you want to do that.
Okay.
Yes. Maybe it - maybe it would make more sense to put the couch up now. Why don't you let me wrestle with the couch before we do anything more to this damn poor L-shaped bag? _page : 219
...
Alright. And we're - we're LOS here for a while anyway, 131 -
Here's about where we are, ... Yes, this is the handiest little thing you've ever seen. ... goes right in the helmet side, won't come out, and you can grab hold of anything you want, and there it is, it won't ...
(Laughter) ...
(Yawn)
... all this little stuff ...
... is this optional - sort of - ...? Huh?
No, optional ...
No, no, this is - used for the intervalometer?
...
... might have some layers on the wall of that crater. It just occurred to me that - that's got to be the result of ... of some sort ...
... is looking good.
Think so.
A little more.
You got to do what, Neil?
I don't think it's harder to ... than it is – at orbital speeds. ... There just isn't any way really of ... altitude - or the size of this thing.
We're in INERTIAL, aren't we?
No, you want to go to INERTIAL?
I wonder if Neil has made any preparations? _page : 220
What's your altitude?
...
I guess we could put - ... to ...
Hey, Neil, I think this - this does have something ...
Alright.
... Now it's on the other side. No, down, down ...
What did you have on ...?
No, that side. Yes, it was down to 3. He called 30 seconds at one time.
Yes, ...
Yes, he called 60 seconds; then I heard him call 30 seconds.
Yes.
... I got it, thank you.
Well, it's held under that forward-velocity unit.
How's that?
With the ..., I don't see how you can -
Leaving on your ... in here?
I think - you had that same pair on all the time.
Is that the ... - sitting there?
Yes, here it is.
Let me put it down here. Bring it on down. Over here. Put them all in one place.
You ready for your underwear? Mike - you ready for your underwear? You ready for your underwear? _page : 221
Just a minute; yes.
... - put our - LCG.
Yes.
Somehow we'll figure a way to ...
2 feet per second.
You didn't maintain that 3-1/2 feet per second down there.
(Laughing)
Well, I hope - I hope they have the data that shows just what we did have at contact when they can get photographs ... all the film we got.
Yes.
Well, I really couldn't put the ... no place, not that I'm sure of it, but my light came on, why, ... hit.
Yes, that's sure - the way that thing was working - the way that thing was working and stayed locked on all the way down - Gees, it was a beautiful thing.
You mean you didn't ...?
Getting all the damn alarms.
Boy, I thought for a while there that some of those might get a little ... - ... I'd reset the program alarm in time for a ... out of there.
Will that one do? ...
Are you staying in this inertial attitude? Let's just leave it in REACQ then; it works just like a charm.
Yes, that's right.
How about that? _page : 222
Beautiful.
405 and 404 - What's the matter with it? (Laughter)
403 I think we ...
... alignment, oops, I got 404 again.
How about that, wise asses! Huh?
You had a - you had to work though, didn't you?
... O2 fuel cell's ....
This is not dumping.
I figured that.
Did you try the other line?
Well - no, I haven't tried a whole number of alternatives. In fact, number 1 is not dumping. My guess would be that it's something to do with this connection in the UCD or something like that. When you try to dump your ... regular urine bag, ... It's so goddam smelly, I hate to grab it and dick around with it, but I guess I got to.
Not entirely. I think I'd rather stick around ...
...
How long does it take to warm up this thing? 3 hours?
...
What state vector is in the LM slot? The LM?
... minus a few feet per second. ...
Well, we got something in the LM slot ...
Well, that's just an old vectors, because I never did VERB 66, I don't think, after ... _page : 223
We got 22 feet per second. Almost have to be LM - previous to the SEP burn.
Well, when it gets to be light, we got to ...
Well, we probably ought to - ... TPI.
Yes, the maneuver ... right amount of ...
... give me a waste bag ....
Yes, just ... a lot ... there.
It was back here.
Yes.
Who took the roll of tape?
Isn't it in its place? Closet?
No, no, it's not in there. It doesn't have that closet anymore. The last I saw it, it was up on the MDC. I gave it - I handed it to one of you guys to -
Yes, I stuck it someplace.
Let's invent a new home for it because that old home is full of that smelly old urine bag.
The floodlight isn't - hasn't even made the bottom of the package warm yet, fellows.
Well, when it goes up there, we'll have to put it up here.
I got the tape - right underneath your couch. Okay?
Alright.
Okay, we need a new home for the tape. Anybody got any good suggestions?
Okay?
Alright. _page : 224
We believed you, though.
(Yawn)
...
Go ahead.
I think we had a ...
Not a burn ...
Oh, God, why ... (laughter) ...
... but right now, I am for a nice beer.
..., some water here. Mike, do you remember trying to get water into a grapefruit-pineapple drink?
No, don't do it.
Yes.
Don't do it.
Couldn't get it in, huh?
No.
..., Buzz?
... some of that.
There's a piece of that great bread that has mold all over it.
You got the flight plan?
...
...
Probably are. I purged them this morning when I woke up, Buzz. Probably did the hydrogen as well.
47, 32, 47? _page : 225
That was quite a wild gyration for docking.
It was.
Son-of-a-bitching - -
You did a pretty good ...
If I'd known how it was going to develop, I wouldn't have gone as far with the bottle as I did. I was in the habit of it, you know, as soon as contact is made, I look at it. It looks okay, I fire the bottle right away.
...
No, I would.
...
No, no.
...
... No sooner than I fired that goddamned bottle, than wow; and away we went.
...
No - they're way down so, I don't know - just ...
Then, when I fired the bottle, and then, just about all that came ... since the thing started, I went back to CMC, AUTO, ... bothering me. And just about that time all those ..., my God, those flashes ... I thought they were ... I thought we were ...
... I mean later on ... all those ...
Look at this.
Yes.
Figured nobody could see where we were ....
Hey, did we decide the ... back? _page : 226
No, the data should go to the log ... The only good thing there you can say about it is ...
... you guys. ... love them ...
All that probe and drogue and claptrap works; all that EVA transfer, you can forget about that and all those crazy procedures for taking that probe apart.
At least, we can forget them until the debriefing.
Yes (laughter).
...
This thing ... make a great ...
Picked up the CSM problem.
I've never thought about it.
...?
No.
All at once.
None of them.
Yes.
... long time.
It's ...?
You got something ...?
Yes. Yes, sir. Purring across the deep. Okay. Look at that.
Yes. We can get VERB 64 before we come over the hill and see what looks good.
Okay. LOS.
Okay. I'm ready to proceed now. _page : 227
Do it.
Here we go.
Say, you guys, ... anything you want to do?
I got to make a star check, yet.
You're not going to fool around with that camera anymore, are you?
No.
I'll take care of it for you.
Post - we might - after post - after PDI if you can put it somewhere where you can get at it. Going away from the moon. I just didn't want it in my way - -
Get all - -
Well, yes, pull it - pull it out of the way.
Neil, the handle -
I have it right here. That durn near has a roll in it - it -
I'll bet you ... likes this.
No. I don't care about any - Well, if it's annoying - let me - I can get it if it is. ... star check ... I don't care about ...
What's that pad say about horizon on the 100-degree - -
2 minutes prior, 100-degree line,
You got double lines?
Yes, I got double line on the 30, so I can use that as a head position ... look down between them.
They're not - they're not parallel? Can you see in the one-eye position? _page : 228
What I'm saying is, on the 30 degree, I have both panes of glass - -
Yes.
- - and if you line those up then, then is your eye in the right position for all the others?
Yes.
Okay.
What's the shaft and trunnion number?
1511.
What? 1511?
151 - -
1511.
We're a long way from being there, Neil; we're rolling over at a very slow rate.
Okay.
You want an extra ... - we got a lot of gas - -
No, no, no.
Be happy to zip on around.
This thing is taking forever to get around here; we've got 20 minutes to TIG. I think I'll speed it up a bit, if you don't mind.
Hey, you got - 1, 0.1, point 1 you mean?
Yes.
You know, if you hit this hand controller like you do in the simulator, MINIMUM IMPULSE, just bang it, it'll bang over and bang back, and it'll fire two opposing pulses, and you get nothing. You know that? _page : 229
(Laughter) Yes.
Oh, shit. ... yaw out 14 degrees. Why in the hell didn't I do that? Read that number wrong.
Yes, it should have been 1.4 degrees yaw.
That "1" gets moved over so far.
Yes, the goddam "1" in this computer, you know - trunnion angle, it's there; DELTA-V, it's there; angles, it's there. It's probably over here for something although I can't think for what, but there, there, there, and there, of course – there is four places.
Okay, we're there, Neil; by the time you can get down there and get your eyeball out the window - -
Hey, what did you do with those numbers again?
Oh, we'll crank them in the computer.
Oh, I got them.
Questioning the accuracy of the computer?
...
Okay, you satisfied with that?
ENTER.
Give me the numbers.
1519, CMC OPTICS ZERO, OFF, VERB 41, NOUN 91.
You mean after I went to all this work of cranking those numbers in you're going to drive back to zero?
We got PROGRAM ALARM and an OPERATOR ERROR.
(Laughter)
Christ. Give me the numbers, 1519 and what? _page : 230
It won't pass with that number.
1511 - 357.
357, okay.
357 and 1511. There's supposed to be a star there.
That's right, if you put them in - in the right order. That 151.1 is shaft.
Yes. I got a star in the - in the sextant.
Good, it passes. Let's press on.
I'm not sure it's Gienah.
Good. There'll be no way of telling - You got 16 minutes until TIG. Did it pass?
OPTICS ZERO - -
OPTICS ZERO and MANUAL. The mode is manual already, isn't it? Okay?
Alright. VERB 37, ENTER; 40, ENTER. Okay.
Okay, BMAG MODE, three, to RATE 2.
BMAG MODE, three, to RATE 2.
SPACECRAFT CONTROL, CMC, AUTO.
CMC, AUTO.
Proceed.
I'll proceed with this ...
Huh? ... Don't you like this one? Alright.
Let's not proceed.
Alright. Stand by. Align spacecraft in roll. Already there.
GDC align. _page : 231
Okay, that's a good one. One - standby 1, and I'll get that.
Okay. GDC aligned.
Circuit breakers: STABILIZATION CONTROL, panel 8, CLOSED.
STABILIZATION CONTROL circuit breakers are CLOSED.
Okay. SPS circuit breakers - eight of them, CLOSED. Twelve of them closed.
SPS, 12 of them closed - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, CLOSED. Okay?
...
Say again.
I lost my clip.

What's the time?
We have 12 minutes to go.
Got the HELIUM VALVES, AUTO and barber pole?
I'll get those.
Okay. I was just wondering if they were on – not questioning your checklist, just out of curiosity.
You going to pitch up after the burn?
Sounds like a good idea; let's look at the moon after the burn. That'll give us high gain, right?
Check.
Okay, 10 minutes until TIG.
Alright.
It's hot in here, isn't it?
... boiling any water.
You do it all?
No. It's not too hot, it's 65.
Those temperatures are deceptive. I don't know where they measure it, but the cold point is -
Okay. Sunrise, now 10 minutes prior to TIG; I should have the horizon on the 10-degree line, huh?
No, 10 degrees - 2 minutes. _page : 233
2 minutes; that's more like it, there.
... this COAS as far as steering and everything goes, it's hopeless.
...
I'm graphically reminded of it at this moment. Yes. I see a horizon. It looks like we are going forward (laughter).
Shades of Gemini.
It is most important that we be going forward (laughter).
There's only one really bad mistake you can make there.
Shades of Gemini retrofire, are you sure we're - (laughter) - No, let 's see - the motors point this way and the gases escape that way, therefore imparting a thrust that-a-way.
Yes, horizon looks good.
Okay, we got 8-1/2 to TIG.
Somewhere along the line, I think I'll trim this maneuver just for the hell of it. Would this be a good time to do it, Buzz, at 8 minutes prior? You don't care when I do it, do you?
No, it probably would be after we - when the gimbals are out.
Oh, yes, alright. Okay.
Beautiful looking horizon, it's hard to describe.
We can see it if we look through that thing you have.
Where's ...?
Here or here? God, it has an eerie look to it. It's not a horizon, it's just a band. _page : 234
You won't be able to see it, Neil, ...
Which way?
This way. Plus X ...
It was really eerie when it first came - -
You got to look through the part of the window that isn't -
Yes. And the way the terminator is, you don't see the whole moon at all, you just see a - -
I know, I was looking at it upside down for a while.
Yes, and then that scares you, because that says you're going retrograde, right? Well, let's see, if it's upside down, you're going backwards.
Yes.
Okay, it looks good, I'll tell you.
Alright, we're coming up on bus tie time; we've got a little over 6:50 until TIG.
Ready for the bus ties.

Just about midnight in Houston town.
Yes.
Okay, coming up on 2 minutes, and this damn horizon check is going to be, would you believe, perfect?
I hope so.

Man, that feels like g, doesn't it?
I caught up - I caught up for a short while, but ...
... pressures are good. Busy in steering, but it's holding right in there.
How is it, Mike?
It's really busy in roll, but it's holding in its deadband. Looks like it's holding instead of plus or minus 5, more like plus or minus 8 - It's possible that we have a roll-thruster problem, but if we have, it's taking it out. No point in worrying about it. Okay, coming up on 1 minute -
MARK it -
1 minute. Chamber pressure's holding right on 100.
... time looks good.
Gimbals look good; total attitude looks good. Rates are damped out - a little bit. Still a little busy, light ...

I think you did that already.
Hey, Neil, you want to proceed on these?
Yes.
Okay, where do we go, P00? To get the HIGH GAIN?
We want - Yes, P00's good - and we want a VERB 48.
Yes. Get in P00 and do a VERB 83.
I'm going to go to SCS and pitch up in the meantime.
Find out where that - other state vector is.
Okay, we're in P00, now who wants what, VERB 48?
No - yes. VERB - oh, okay.
Ah - -
I don't know ... -
Well, it says change spacecraft weight.
DAP update. Yes - -
You've got your - -

Look at that, would you? Look at that.
Isn't that beautiful?
Pretty good.
A thing of beauty is a joy forever.
Alright, now call the VERB 89 in and see which way that - -
Oh, come on, you're not serious.
... know to find out which way the ... is -
Okay.
- - you were wrong. ...
Okay, we got to visually acquire moon, take pictures, and then you got a P52 to do.
... some unknown reason - -
We haven't got any damned program ready to call up. ... It's the only way you can do it. Supposed to do a VERB 66 and then put numbers ... apogee ... and then look at altitude and altitude rate - -
What are you doing, Mike? What you taking pictures of -
Oh, I don't know. Wasting film, I guess.
You can take some pretty good pictures out of the hatch, here. _page : 246
You're right. This crapping thing - ... set on f:4 or 5.6; that's probably about right.
Here's a ring that came from somewhere; I wonder where (singing).
You want to take pictures over here? Go ahead, why don't you just set up that - -
I'll check window 3.
- - set up that tape and let it do its thing; it's still got a long way to go for ...
Alright, now, do we want black and white, color, 250, or 80? I've got all options over here.
Oh, we'll probably want - How many cameras you got?
Let me have a camera. How many cameras?
Well, only one camera, but I've got ... lenses.
You're a poor ...
Well, let's take some color, and -
Want the 80, right? On this one?
Yes, I think you want to get - -
Let me know when I'm in a - in a good attitude to stop this pitch. How about right now?
Stop. What are you doing?
I'm rolling.
What for? What do you want to roll for?
I was off in roll; I'm taking it back to where I should have been. This is a pretty good attitude right here, looks to me -
Alright, I've seen enough of VERB 83, Mike - -
Here you go. _page : 247
- - unless you want to call a VERB 89.
Not me; I'd rather take pictures.
What time is AOS?
Haven't the foggiest.
It's 135:34.
That's right now.
Give me a VERB 51.
Anybody got any choice greetings they want to make to Houston?
No, I - the best burn I've ever seen in my life, I'll tell you. I guess you guys have seen two good ones today.
Oh, a couple.
Yes, more than two. AOS.
Yes, we sure as hell have.
Get the burn status.
Hey, I hope somebody's getting the picture of the earth coming up.
... Not quite pitched far enough. Well, maybe I can get it out - -
I can get around to here.

Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Roger. We've checked over the spacecraft and the launch vehicle guidance. They're both looking to be in good shape. We estimate you have better than a 99-percent probability of a guidance cut-off on the launch vehicle, so things are apparently holding in very well. For your information, MILA received approximately 1 minute of a usable TV picture, so apparently the system is working. And you're a little over a minute from LOS at Canary; AOS Tananarive is 2 hours 9 minutes and 18 seconds. Over.
Roger. We like those 99 numbers. Thank you.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston through Tananarive. How do you read?
Apollo 11, this is Houston standing by through Tananarive.
Tananarive, Houston COMM TECH NET 1.
Tananarive, Houston COMM TECH NET 1.
Goddard voice, Houston COMM TECH NET 1.
Goddard voice, reading you loud and clear.
Roger. We cannot raise Tananarive.
Houston COMM TECH, Tananarive.
Roger, Tananarive. Are you receiving CAP COMM's voice, and are you uplinking it?
Negative.
Roger. Monitor again and I'll tell CAP COMM to make one more transmission.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston standing by through Tananarive. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11 ...
Roger. Reading you loud and clear.
Houston, Apollo 11. We have the PYRO's armed.
This is Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. One minute to LOS Tananarive; AOS at Carnarvon 02 25 30.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston through Carnarvon. Radio check. Over.
Roger, Houston through Carnarvon. Apollo 11. Loud and clear.
Roger. You're coming in very loud and very clear, here. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are GO for TLI. Over.
Apollo 11. Thank you.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, 11.
Roger. We'll be coming within range of the ARIA aircraft coverage, here, in about 1 minute. They're going to try uplinking both on S-band and on VHF this time. So if you turn your - make sure your S-band volume is turned up, we'd appreciate it. And we believe that we'll have continuous coverage from now on through the TLI burn. Over.
Very good.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston through ARIA 4. Radio check. Over.
Houston, we read you strength 4 and a little scratchy.
Roger. We're reading you strength 5, readability about 3. Should be quite adequate.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're reading you readability about 3, strength 5. Sounds pretty good. Over.
Roger. We've got a little static in the background now.
Apollo 11, this is Houston through ARIA 3. Radio check. Over.
Roger, Houston, Apollo 11. You are much clearer and adequately loud. Over.
Roger, 11, You are coming in five-by-five here. Beautiful signal.
This is a lot better than this static we had previously.
Okay.
And we got the time base fix indication on time.
This is Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We just got telemetry back down on your booster, and it is looking good.
Roger. Everything looks good here.
Houston, Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Slightly less than 1 minute to ignition, and everything is GO.
Roger.
Ignition.
We confirm ignition, and the thrust is GO.
Apollo 11, this is Houston at 1 minute. Trajectory and guidance look good, and the stage is good. Over.
Apollo 11. Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Thrust is good. Everything's still looking good.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Around 3-1/2 minutes. You're still looking good. Your predicted cut-off is right on the nominal.
Roger. Apollo 11 is GO.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are GO at 5 minutes.
Roger. We're GO.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We show cut-off and we copy the numbers in NOUN 62.
Apollo 11, Houston. Do you read?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. We're reading a VI of 35579 and the EMS was plus 3.3. Over.
Roger. Plus 3.3 on the EMS. And we copy the VI.
Hey, Houston, Apollo 11. That Saturn gave us a magnificent ride.
Roger, 11. We'll pass that on. And, it certainly looks like you are well on your way now.
We have no complaints with any of the three stages on that ride. It was beautiful.
Roger. We copy. No transients at staging of any significance. Over.
That's right. It was all - all a good ride.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. For your information, we expect the maneuver to separation attitude to begin at 3 plus 05 plus 03, and to be completed at plus 09 plus 20. Separation at 3 plus 15 plus 00.
Roger. Time to begin maneuver is 3 05 03, complete 3 09 20. Separation 3 plus 15 00.
Roger. That separation should be 3 plus 15 03. My error in reading up.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. All the booster functions are proceeding normally. The sequencing is in good shape, and it doesn't look like they are having any problems at all. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Our preliminary data indicates a good cut-off on the S-IVB. We'll have some more trajectory data for you in about half an hour. Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Hello, Houston. Hello, Houston. This is Apollo 11. I'm reading you loud and clear. Go ahead. Over.
Roger, 11. This is Houston. We had to shift stations. We weren't reading you through Goldstone. We show PYRO bus A armed and PYRO bus B not armed at the present time. Over.
That's affirmative, Houston. That's affirmative.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You're GO for separation. Our systems recommendation is arm both PYRO buses. Over.
Okay. PYRO B coming armed. My intent is to use bottle primary 1, as per the checklist; therefore, I just turned A on.
Roger. We concur with the logic.
Houston, we're about to SEP.
This is Houston. We copy.
SEP is complete.
Roger.
... and primary and secondary propellant B went ... SEP.
That was secondary propellant on quad Bravo?
Quad Bravo, yes. Both the primary and secondary ...
Roger. We copy.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston broadcasting in the blind. Request OMNI Bravo if you read us. Request OMNI Bravo. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Roger. ...
Roger. We're copying you about five-by-two, very weak. Can you give us a status report, please?
Roger. We are docked. We do have acquisition with the high gain at this time, I think.
Understand you are using the high gain. Over.
That's affirmative.
That's affirmative.
Roger. I read you very loud and clear, Buzz. Mike is pretty weak.
Roger. We've got the high gain locked on, now, I believe; AUTO tracking now.
Okay. You're coming in loud and clear, but Mike is just barely readable.
That was Neil. How are you reading Mike?
Loud and clear now, Mike, and we understand that you are docked.
That's affirmative.
Houston, CDR. How do you read ...?
11, CDR, loud and clear, Neil.
Okay.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Roger. When you commented on that quad Bravo problem at separation, you were a little weak. Could you go through what you did after you noticed the talkbacks barber pole again, please?
We copied the - the primary and secondary propellant talkbacks on SM RCS quad Bravo 1 to barber pole on separation.
Roger. Roger. That is affirmative, and we moved that switch to the OPEN position, and they went back to gray. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Roger. Could you give us comments on how the transposition and docking went? Over.
I thought it went pretty well, Houston, although I expect I used more gas than I've been using in the simulator. The turnaround maneuver - I went PITCH ACCEL COMMAND and started to pitch up, and then when I put MANUAL ATTITUDE PITCH back to RATE COMMAND for some reason it - it stopped its pitch rate, and I had to go back to ACCEL COMMAND and hit what I thought was an extra PROCEED on the DSKY. During the course of that, we drifted slightly further away from the S-IVB than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet. My guess would be I was around 100 or so; and therefore, I expect I used a bit more coming back in. But, except for using a little more gas - And I'd be interested in your numbers on that - everything went nominally.
This is Houston. Roger. We copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. We're working on the pressurization of the LM now, and working off the decal with CSM-LM pressure equalization. And we're down to step 13, where we're waiting for the cabin pressure to be 5, or it should be roughly 5, before we turn the REPRESS package O<sub>2</sub> valve to FILL. Instead of 5, we're running about 4.4. Over.
Roger. Stand by a second.
And Houston, Apollo 11. We did put the REPRESS package O<sub>2</sub> valve to FILL momentarily there at step 13, and we have filled the bottles back up partially. What's the pressure reading in there, Neil?
We have about 450 psi now in the three 1-pound bottles.
Roger. Stand by a second, please.
Roger. Standing by. The REPRESS package valve is now in the OFF position. What's the cabin pressure now, Buzz? Cabin pressure is now 4.5.
Houston, Apollo 11. We think these readings are within normal tolerances. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press down any further with these decals.
Okay, Captain.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. LM looks to be in pretty fine shape from about all we can see from here.
Okay. In reference to your question on this step 13 on the decal, I understand that you have used up the contents of the REPRESS O<sub>2</sub> package and at that time, instead of being up to 5 psi, you were reading 4.4. Is that correct?
Okay. 4.4. Yes sir.
Okay. And you want to know if you can go ahead and use additional oxygen to bring the command module up to 5.0 and continue the equalization? Over.
Yes. We think it's within normal tolerances, Bruce. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press on with this procedure.
Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Okay. We're pressing on with the procedure.
And 11, Houston. We have a request for you. On the service module secondary propellant fuel pressurization valve: As a precautionary measure, we'd like you to momentarily cycle the four switches to the CLOSE position and then release. As you know, we have no TM or talkback on these valve positions, and it's conceivable that one of them might also have been moved into a different position by the shock of separation. Over.
Okay. Good idea. That's being done.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're doing a nonpropulsive vent on the booster at the present time. You may see some sort of a cloud coming out of it. When you're ready, I have your evasive maneuver PAD.
Roger, And it's coming out.
Roger. Out,
It's a haze. It's going by toward our minus-X direction, and several small particles are moving along with it. The actual velocity is fairly high - at least it appears to be high. And we've got an O<sub>2</sub> high - it's a little high right now.
Houston. Roger. Out.
And, Houston, you, might be interested that out my left-hand window right now, I can observe the entire continent of North America, Alaska, and over the Pole, down to the Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba, northern part of South America, and then I run out of window.
Roger, We copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. All 12 latches are locked.
Roger. 11, this is Houston. Understand 12 latches locked.
11, Houston. Whenever you're possessed of a free moment there, we've got this evasive maneuver PAD.
Okay.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11 is ready to copy.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Evasive maneuver SPS G&N: 63481, plus 095, minus 020; GETI 004 40 0100, plus 00051, plus all balls, plus 00190; roll is your option, pitch 213 357; NOUN 44 is NA; DELTA-VT is 00197 003 00152. The rest of the PAD is NA. No ullage. LM weight 33,290. Read back. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Standing by for your readback. Over.
11, Houston. Do you read? Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
All of a sudden there, we heard a little click, and the signal strength began to start dropping off. Your transmissions were cut off very abruptly. How do you read now?
Roger. Loud and clear. We had a handover to Madrid about the time I was - I guess halfway through the PAD. If you could give me the last value you read, I'll pick up there. Over.
Okay. Start with DELTA-VZ. Over.
Roger. DELTA-VZ is plus 00190, roll your option, pitch 213 357, and NOUN 44 is NA. DELTA-VT 00197 003 00152. The rest of the PAD is NA, and no ullage. LM weight 33,290. Read back. Over.
Roger, Houston. Evasive maneuver SPS G&N: 63481, plus 095, minus 020 004 40 0100, plus 00051, plus all zeros, plus 00190, roll crew option, 213 357, NA, 00197 003 00152, no ullage, LM weight 33,290. Over.
11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
We'd like to arm our logic switches.
Go ahead with the logic.
Okay. Mark logic 1 and 2 armed.
Roger. We show the logic arm, and you're GO for PYRO arm.
Houston, we're ready for LM ejection.
Roger. You're GO for LM ejection.
Thank you.
Houston, we are SEP. We have a CRYO PRESS light.
Roger. Copy. CRYO PRESS light.
Roger, 11. We recommend you turn the O<sub>2</sub> fans on manually and ensure that the O<sub>2</sub> heaters are in the AUTOMATIC position.
Roger. O<sub>2</sub> heaters are ON, and we're going to cycle the O<sub>2</sub> fans now.
Roger. O<sub>2</sub> heaters to AUTO, or you can watch them in the ON position, and O<sub>2</sub> fans manual ON.
Apollo 11, this ls Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. In reference to your question on RCS usage: it looks like you are about 18, maybe 20 pounds below nominal at the present time. No problem at all. Over.
Right.
I wanted to be 18 or 20 pounds above nominal, babe.
Sorry about that.
11, Houston. Your systems are looking good. We're standing by for the burn.
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you confirm that pitch gimbal motor number 1 turned off? We just shut all four off, and we got a questionable indication on the ECS on pitch 1.
Roger. Stand by a second.
Houston, did you copy our residuals?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Stand by, please.
Go ahead, Houston. Did you copy our residuals?
Roger. We got 00 and 0.2, it looks like.
We had 0.1 while ago. It's - just went to 0.2.
Okay.
That EMS DELTA-V counter is minus 4.0.
Minus 4.0. Roger.
And how about pitch gimbal 1? Can you confirm that OFF?
Can you stand by just a second on that? At the present time we cannot confirm it OFF. We saw a current drop indicating that several gimbal motors had gone off. We'll be back with you in just a second on it. Over.
Okay, If necessary, we can recycle it.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you'll go ahead and cycle pitch gimbal motor number 1 on and then off and give us a Mark, and we'll tell you what we see. Over.
Okay, fine. It's coming back on. Ready.
MARK.
And it's going back off. Ready.
MARK.
And that time we got an onboard indication, Houston. Thank you a lot.
Roger. We confirm that it is OFF.
Yes. We do likewise.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're starting our maneuver to observe the S-IVB slingshot.
Roger, 11. We've got an updated attitude for you on the slingshot observation.
Okay. Say the angles please.
Roger. Roll 002.5, pitch 289.3, yaw 357.5, and there's also an update - minor correction to your attitude for the P52. Over.
Roger. I have roll 002.5, pitch 289.3, and yaw 357.5. Over.
Roger. And for your P52 and optics calibration, it'll be roll 346.5, pitch 345.0, and yaw 007.8. Over.
Roger. 346.5, 345.0, and 007.8. Thank you.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger. We're going to go ahead and enable the S-IVB for the slingshot maneuver. The LOX dump will start about 12 minutes from now. Over.
Okay, LOX dump about - I guess that'll make it about 01, huh?
Right. I'll try to give you a little closer update as we approach it.
Alright.
And, 11, for you information, the magnitude of midcourse correction number 1, if we burn, looks like about 17 feet per second. We're presently considering not burning it. This would make midcourse correction 2 tomorrow about 21.3. Over.
That sounds good to us.
Roger. You're looking good down here.
Well, we didn't have much time, Houston, to talk to you about our views out the window when we were preparing for LM ejection; but up to that time, we had the entire northern part of the lighted hemisphere visible including North America, North Atlantic, and Europe and Northern Africa. We could see that the weather was good all - just about everywhere. There was one cyclonic depression in Northern Canada, in the Athabaska - probably east of Athabaska area. Greenland was clear, and it appeared to be we were seeing just the icecap in Greenland. All North Atlantic was pretty good; and Europe and Northern Africa seemed to be clear. Most of the United States was clear. There was a low - looked like a front stretching from the center of the country up across north of the Great Lakes and into Newfoundland.
Roger. We copy.
I didn't know what I was looking at, but I sure did like it.
Okay. I guess the view must be pretty good from up there. We show you just roughly somewhere around 19,000 miles out now.
I didn't have much outside my window.
We'll get you into the PTC one of these days, and you take turns looking.
Houston, Apollo 11. We've completed our maneuver to, observe the slingshot attitude, but we don't see anything - no Earth and no S-IVB.
Roger. Stand by. In GET I have a LOX dump start time for you. It's supposed to start at 5 plus 03 plus 07, and stop at 5 plus 04 plus 55. Ullage burn starts at 5 plus 37 plus 47, stops at 5 plus 42 plus 27. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
11, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We now recommend the following attitude: roll 307.0, pitch 354.0, yaw 019.5, and the LOX dump has already been enabled, so we can't hold it off any longer.
That's okay. Go ahead. We'll maneuver around to 307, 354, and 19 and a half. Thank you sir.
Roger.
11, Houston. It doesn't look to us like you'll be able to make it around to this observation attitude in 2 minutes. We recommend that you save the fuel. Over.
Okay, Houston. You got to us just a little late. Our maneuver's already begun, so it's going to cost us about the same amount of fuel to stop it, no matter where we stop it, and we may as well keep going.
Roger. Go ahead.
11, Houston. LOX dump initiated.
11, Houston. LOX dump has been terminated. Over.
Roger.
Roger. We still don't have ...
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. If you'll give us ACCEPT and stay in P00, we'll set your trunnion bias to zero. And, I have a plan for balancing your oxygen CRYO's. Over.
You got it.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the - what appears to be the S-IVB in sight - at - oh, I'd estimate a couple of miles away. It's at our number 5 window and the dump appears to be coming out of two radially opposite directions from the S-IVB.
Roger. They're continuing with the nonpropulsion vent from the liquid oxygen tank. It would be radially opposite, then. And boosters tell me it's the continuous vent system. They're also dumping a small amount of fuel at this time. We've got about 23-1/2 minutes or so until the APS burn. Over.
Roger.
11, Houston. We have a recommended configuration for your CRYO switches to even up the load between oxygen tanks 1 and 2. Over.
...
Okay. You're coming in very weakly there. We're recommending O<sub>2</sub> tank 1 heater OFF, O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heater to AUTO, O<sub>2</sub> tanks 1 and 2 fans both OFF, H<sub>2</sub> tank 1 heaters to AUTO, and H<sub>2</sub> tank 1 heaters to AUTO, and H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters to OFF. Over.
Roger. We have that except the last one was H<sub>2</sub> fans to OFF. Is that affirmative?
We have - The configuration we have now is - Hydrogen heaters: we got 1 AUTO, 2 OFF. Oxygen heaters: 1 OFF, 2 AUTO. And we have all the fans OFF.
This is Houston. Roger. We concur. Out.
11, this is Houston. We've completed the trunnion zero bias setting. You can retrieve the computer and go to BLOCK.
Roger that. Thank you.
11, this is Houston. With this maneuvering to observe the slingshot, I guess we missed copying your LM/CM DELTA-P reading. Over.
Stand by. We'll give you a ...
Roger.
Right now, reading 0.2, Bruce.
Roger. 0.2.
Okay, Mike. And could you verify that your waste compartment valve is in VENT, there?
Roger. Waste compartment valve has been in VENT for - oh, I guess, 45 minutes or so.
Roger. We copy.
If we're late in answering you, it's because we're munching sandwiches.
Roger. I wish I could do the same here.
No. Don't leave the console!
Don't worry. I won't.
FLIGHT doesn't like it.
How is FLIGHT today?
Oh, he's doing quite well.
Houston, 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Down in the control center you might want to join us in wishing Dr. George Mueller a happy birthday.
Roger. We are standing by for your birthday greetings.
I think today is also the birthday of California, and I believe they are 200 years old, and we send them a happy birthday. And I think it's Dr. Mueller's birthday, also, and I don't think he is that old.
Roger. We copy. I'm looking back in the viewing room right now. I don't see him back there.
He may not be back from the Cape yet.
Roger. I believe Dr. Mueller is on his way back from the Cape. We will relay his greetings for you.
Thank you.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. At your convenience, we would like to get a waste-water dump to 5 percent remaining. After completion of this one, the next wastewater dump will be at about GET equal to 25 hours. Over.
Coming on right now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. Did you copy our torquing angles?
Roger. Leave them on there probably a second, please.
Will do.
11, this is Houston. We copy the angles, but stand by before you go ahead and use them. Over.
Standing by.
11, Houston. We request that you read P52, and if the angles come out the same magnitude, go ahead and incorporate them. Over.
Okay. We'll do that.
They look a little large right now.
Yes. Roll - roll locks a little large, especially, there.
Roger.
We're showing a waste-water quantity of about 13 percent on TM now, 11. Over.
Roger. It's off, now
Roger. We copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. Torquing angles essentially the same, and we're going to go ahead and torque them now.
Roger. We concur.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Could you give us a - an AUTO optics check to a third star or a different star from the one you've been using?
Sure, be glad to. I can go back and do the whole thing and pick different stars.
I don't think there - there's any need to do that. We'd just like to confirm it with a different star, since that roll angle was a little larger than we expected.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. I have a TLI-plus-11-hour PAD when you're ready to copy.
Wait one.
Old star number 30 looks like it is right dab smack in the middle of the sextant.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Ready to copy.
Roger, 11 This is TLI-plus-11-hours. P37 format: 01344 4793, minus 165 04923. Read back. Over.
Roger. 01344 4793, minus 165 04923. Over.
This is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. Do you have any update for the roll, pitch and yaw angles on the top of page 37 in the flight plan. Or are they still good?
That's for the optics calibration?
Yes, sir.
Yes, indeed. I'll give them to you in just a second here.
Roger, 11. For the optics calibration I've got 346.5 for roll, 345.0 for pitch, and 007.8 for yaw. The pen-and-ink attitude corrections in your book for P23 are good. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
And we're going to hand over to Hawaii in about 5 or 6 seconds, here. We'll have a momentary COMM dropout.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Be advised your friendly White Team has come on for its first shift, and if we can be of service, don't hesitate to call.
Thank you very much. And we're about to take our marks, Charlie, on this P23 optics CAL. I've got it in the sextant now, and I'm about to split the image and Mark.
Roger, Mike. We're watching.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have scrubbed the midcourse 1. Over.
Roger. Understand you've scrubbed midcourse 1.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We see your middle gimbal angle getting pretty big. Over.
Well, it was, Charlie, but in going from one AUTO maneuver to another, we took over control and have gone around gimbal lock; and we're about to give control back to the DAP.
Roger, Mike. We see it increasing now.
Hey Charlie.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Hey, maybe you better call Lou and tell him we might be a little bit late for dinner.
Okay. Sure will. We'd like for you to turn on - the fan on in O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2, Buzz. And, 11, did you - on your optics calibrations, did you proceed or recall the program? Over.
We recalled the program.
Roger.
And O<sub>2</sub> fan number 2 is on.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. I've got a CRYO pressure light and a MASTER ALARM. It's reset.
Roger. We expected that. That's why we had you turn the fan on. We were getting pretty close to the caution and warning limits. We were trying to prevent that.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Roger. You're looking at our DELTA-R DELTA-V. It looks like DELTA-R is pretty large, there. We wanted to talk to you about it before we incorporate it.
Stand by, Mike. We don't have anything on our downlink here, I don't think, on the DSKY. Stand by.
Okay. Our NOUN 49 is reading: register 1, plus 08793; register 2, all balls.
Copy.
11, Houston. Guidance is looking at the NOUN 40 - 49 stuff. We'll be back with you momentarily. Over.
Okay, Charlie. Thank you. We'll just hold right here in the program.
Roger. We got the downlink now. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to reject the NOUN 49 stuff on the DSKY right now, Mike, and try it again. Over.
Okay. Will do.
Okay, Houston. Apollo 11. Here's another 49 for you. Are you getting it on the downlink?
Roger. We see it. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49 display on the DSKY now. Over.
Okay. It looks like an awful big one. We noticed that you'd moved star number 2 to the tail end of the listing, and we should be marking first on star 40. Did that have anything to do with it?
Negative. We don't believe so, Apollo 11. We think that this is possibly due to some TLI dispersions, and it's probably satisfactory. So go ahead and accept this. It fits our criteria anyway that if you repeat the mark and you get an equivalent size to go ahead and accept it. And this is an equivalent size error. Over.
Okay. We'll do it.
And 11, Houston. Your state vector in the LM slots are - is good. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11. If you like this, we'll accept it as well.
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49. Over.
Okay, Charlie. Thank you. We'll do that now.
Thank you.
And we're going to proceed on this one, too, Charlie.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. Another NOUN 49 for you.
Roger. We copy. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to recycle and do this one over again. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger. Why don't you sing out when you think we've done enough battery charging on B.
Roger. Stand by, Buzz. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll be charging battery B up until the sleep period. We'll discontinue charging at that time. Also, at about 12 25 in the flight plan, we have battery A charge. That has been deleted. Over.
Roger. Understand. We'll charge until the sleep period on B and delete the battery A charge.
Affirmative.
And, Houston, Apollo 11. These AUTO optics maneuvers or P23's, AUTO maneuvers, don't seem to be going to the substellar point. Can you come up with the roll, pitch, and yaw angle for the substellar point on this star? It's our second star.
Roger. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your angles in the flight plan we feel are still good, 198.6 130.7, 340.0. Just slightly off than those in the flight plan. Over.
Okay. We'll try that.
Charlie, state those three angles one more time. I'd like to confirm them before I maneuver.
Roger. Roll and pitch are slightly off than what's in the flight plan, 11. Roll is now 198.6, pitch is 1307. Over.
Roger. Roll 198.6, pitch 130.7, and yaw 34000.
That's affirmative.
Houston, Apollo 11. I think the problem here is that that attitude just is not too close to the substellar point. I'm having to maneuver quite a bit; and that's in progress now, so stand by for some marks.
Roger. We copy it all.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've run the angles given in the flight plan for the P23 attitude through the machines down here, and they come up the same thing every time. We think everything's going correctly, Mike, and we're wondering if the nonsymmetrical horizon might by giving a problem. Over.
Yes, I'd say - It could be, Charlie. Stand by here. We'll get another mark for you.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. NOUN 49 for you.
Roger. Copy.
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We recommend you accept the NOUN 49. Continue through your sequence of sightings, and then we'll analyze the data afterwards. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. Star 40 has just disappeared now in the sextant. Could the trunnion angle 47 - something be a little high?
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to press on to star 44. Over.
Yes. Roger. All right. How many marks have you recorded on star 40?
Stand by, Mike.
Okay.
11, Houston. We copied two good marks. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead. Over.
Roger. Forty-four is just not bright enough for this. There's a reddish glow filling the black area of the sextant, and the star is lost somewhere in there, and I cannot see it.
Roger. Stand by. We'll come up with another star. Over.
Yes. I'd appreciate that.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go on to star 45. Over.
Okay.
And, Mike, we think these large DELTA-R's, NOUN 49, you're getting is really meaningful since it's been way before TLI since we had a state vector update; and we think it's normal. Over.
Okay. Could be, Charlie. Some of the early markings, I might not have had precisely the substellar point. I think as time goes by they've been coming more accurate but old Enif here is just flat invisible.
Roger.
And, Houston, Apollo 11. Understand that the same three gimbal angles you gave me should be valid for star 45 as well. Is that affirmative?
I'm believe that's right. Stand by one. Over.
Okay.
That is negative. Stand by one.
Okay. Because there's quite a difference between the gimbal angles you have and the gimbal angles the program wants, but with inaccurate state vector, I'm inclined not to believe the program.
Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. LMP is back on the line.
Roger. Copy.
Read you five-by.
Roger. Same, Buzz. And, 11, the angles for you are 1978 for roll, 1285 pitch, 3400 yaw.
Okay. Just as a matter of comparison, P23 for this star would like to go to 235.66, 154.31, and 31365. Over.
Roger. We copy, 11. We understand that the program can give you almost an infinite combination of angles in P23, and it's not too unreasonable. If you'll stand by, we'll look at these that we see on the DSKY. Over.
Okay. Then in the meantime I'll just go ahead and maneuver to yours. 197.8, 128.5, and 340.0.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead. Over.
Okay, Charlie. If the attitude you gave me on star number 45 - The reticle is off, I'd say, a good 30 degrees in roll, and the star is not in sight. Over.
Roger. Stand by.
I think something's wrong with those attitudes.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if you have AUTO optics selected. Over.
That's affirmative.
Roger. Looks like to us we need a PROCEED, Mike, to get the sextant pointed at the star. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
11, Houston. Those shaft and trunnion angles were exactly what we were computing on the ground. Over.
Okay. I'm going to trim up the attitude here and give it another try.
Okay. I have this star loud and clear now, Charlie, so I might as well do a bunch of marks on this one to get a good horizon count.
Roger. Stand by.
It still looks like I'm far from the substellar point. However, I'm off quite a hit in roll.
Roger. We'd like you to mark right where it is now, Mike, and we'd like two sets of marks on this. Over.
Okay. Fine. But the reticle is not parallel to the horizon. I'd have to move off quite a hit in order to get it parallel to that.
Apollo 11, Houston. Our procedures guys are saying that the reticle does not have to be parallel. Over.
Well, then we're not at the substellar point if we're not.
Roger.
Houston, you copy that NOUN 49?
Roger. We see it, 11. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. We would like you to accept this one and every mark thereafter. Over.
Okay.
Do you need me to wait in the NOUN 49 display for any length of time?
Negative.
Okay.
Okay, Charlie. I'll be glad to give you as many of these as you like.
Roger. We'd like six marks on star 45, Mike, and then we'll probably go back to star 2 again. Stand by. We'll have further word on that.
Okay.
They seem to be getting smaller, Charlie. Are you sure you wouldn't like some more?
Stand by, Mike.
It's no trouble.
Roger. Stand by. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to do two more on star 45. Over.
Okay.
Okay, Charlie. There's your two more marks. Where do you want to go from here?
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to go back to star number 2 with an attitude as follows: roll 1952, pitch 1239, yaw 3400. Mike, that'll give you a trunnion angle of about 31.4. Over.
Okay. I understand star number 2 and roll 195.2, itch 123.9, and yaw 340.0. Over.
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Okay, Charlie. I'm there, and I've got a trunnion angle of 30.5 degrees. Again, misaligned considerably in roll and I do believe that's important to getting good marks.
Stand by.
See, if my reticle's not parallel, then I'm not marking normal to the horizon and I'm not marking at the substellar point. I'm marking off somewhere else.
Stand by one. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. The ground-computed values for your shaft and trunnion are just what you're getting on the DSKY there, Mike. The horizon looks cocked off to you - You look like you're off in roll because the angles that we gave you to maneuver to, to prevent LM reflection from fouling up your optics, we feel like a - You should go ahead and mark on the stars just as is. Over.
Okay.
I'll bet you a cup of coffee on it.
Copy.
VERB - NOUN 49 for you, Charlie.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to accept this one and give us two more and that will be enough. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. We see your termination on P23. Thank you very much. Mike, we'll have a - We're trying to work up a story here for you; we'll be with you momentarily on an explanation of what's happening. Over.
Okay, Charlie. It just appears to me that you have to have a reticle tangent to the horizon at the point at which you mark or else you're not at the substellar point; you're off laterally, and therefore you're measuring a larger trunnion angle than you should.
Seems so to me. Our procedures people are working on this, and we'll be back with you momentarily. Over.
Thank you, sir.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to go P00 in ACCEPT. We'll have a PTC REFSMMAT for you momentarily. Over.
Roger. Going P00 in ACCEPT.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're through with the load. You can go back to BLOCK.
You're BLOCK. Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to do a P52, option 1 preferred, and establish PTC as listed in the flight plan at 12 hours. We'd like you to commence that right now, Mike. And we have some stars recommended for you. For stars 26, 30, and 24, when you get to attitude 000. Over.
Okay, Charlie. He's off the wick right now. Understand you're ready for us to do a P52, option 1?
11, it's a P52, option 1 preferred. Over.
Roger. And, let's see, that is Spica, Menkent, and what else?
Roger. Stars - Codes are stars 26, 30, and 24. Over.
24. Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We notice your PROGRAM ALARM, Mike, was due to using these stars in the P23 attitude. If you'll go to 000, the stars we gave you will work. Over.
Okay. Understand.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Prior to you starting your P52, we'd like to give you a new CSM state vector. Over.
Roger. Wait till we finish the maneuver and we'll give you the DSKY.
Roger. We're standing by.
Houston, Apollo 11. The DSKY is yours.
Apollo 11, Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Roger. The DSKY is yours.
Roger. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can do the VERB 66. The computer is yours, and then the P52, option 1 preferred. Over.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you read, this attitude 000 is pretty bad for our COMM. In fact, we've lost all data with you, and unreadable on the voice. We recommend you do the P52, option 1 preferred ...
... not a very good attitude at all for COMM, and as soon as we finish our alignment, we'll maneuver it to a different attitude. Over.
Roger, 11. We copy. Recommend you go to this P52, option 1 preferred, and then go to PTC attitude. Over. Then we'll get some COMM. When you get there to PTC attitude, it'll be pitch 90, yaw 0 on the high gain. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger, 11. You're about one-by. Go ahead.
Apollo 11, Houston. You're about one-by. Go ahead. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger, 11. Read you about four-by. How me? Over.
You're loud and clear, Charlie. We pitched down some to get a better COMM attitude.
Roger. Did you copy our recommendation on proceeding with the P52, Mike? Over.
Negative. We didn't. I've got that in work. I'm starting on P52.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Roger. Copy our torquing angles. We're about to torque them.
Roger. Stand by.
Roger. The reason for delay, Charlie, is that - difficult to find two stars that are not occulted by the LM and also are not in the midst of a manmade star field up here with dumps.
Roger. We copy.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can torque the NOUN 93. Over.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. That completes the P52. We verified the third star with Antares, and AUTO optics are pointing at it pretty closely. How do our platform drift angles look so far, Charlie?
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We didn't have a chance to get a good check for you. We're going to run a drift check from this alignment until the next one, approximately 12 hours, and we'll have something for you later. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to establish your PTC. We recommend you select quads Alfa and Delta. Over.
Roger. Understand. Alfa and Delta quads.
That's affirmative.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you verify that the ATTITUDE SET switch is in GDC? Over.
The SET switch. Stand by one, Charlie.
Roger.
It is now.
Roger. It was on IMU.
That's affirmative.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11. How many miles out do you have us now?
We have you - Stand by, Buzz. Roughly about 50,000. Stand by.
It's a beautiful sight.
Charlie, on that PTC, we're just waiting our 20 minutes here for all thruster activity to damp out. You might let us know how that's coming.
Roger. Will do. We have you about 48,000 miles now.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11. We still have our oxygen fan on for tank 2. Is that what you want?
Stand by.
Hey, Charlie, I can see the snow on the mountains out in California, and it looks like LA doesn't have much of a smog problem today.
Roger, Buzz. Copy. Looks like there's a good view out there then.
And, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to keep the O<sub>2</sub> fan on. It will give you an ECS configuration prior to sleep. Over.
Okay. Thanks.
Charlie, with the monocular, I can discern a definite green cast to the San Fernando Valley.
Roger.
How's Baja California look, Buzz?
Well, it's got some clouds up and down it, and there's a pretty good circulation system a couple of hundred miles off the west coast of California.
Roger. 11, we'd like you to close the waste storage vent valve right now.
Okay.
Waste storage vent valves closed.
Copy.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like - The rates are looking pretty good right now on the PTC, but we'd like you to continue holding. Over.
Okay. Fine.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Your rates look really great, now. You can start your PTC.
Okay. Thanks, Charlie.
Houston, you read 11?
Roger. Go ahead, 11. Over.
Roger. If you'd like to delay PTC after - for 10 minutes or so, we can shoot you some TV of a seven-eights earth. That's - We'll leave that up to you,
Roger. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'll have our answer for you on the TV in about 1 minute. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready at Goldstone for the TV. It'll be recorded at Goldstone and then replayed back over here, Neil, any time you want to turn her on, we're ready. Over.
Okay. It'll take us about 5 minutes to get rigged.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you verify the reading on your O<sub>2</sub> flow indicator? Over.
We're still on 0.2. We just inadvertently touched the RAPID REPRESS button. That made a temporary glitch in the flow.
Roger. During that glitch there, did it go almost a peg high? Over.
I'd believe that.
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you tell us if the O<sub>2</sub> flow indicator was pegged high prior to closing the waste storage vent valve? Over.
No, it was not.
Roger. Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. While ago we tracked into the scan limits and disabled the AUTO drive on the high gain. We'd like you to position the antenna at pitch 30, yaw 270, go to REACQ and that will give us narrow beamwidth. Over.
That yaw 270 and pitch 3 - What was the pitch?
Pitch 30, Neil.
Okay. I think we've got you.
Roger. We've got a good signal there. Thank you much.
Okay, Houston. We are sending picture of Earth down right now, so you can - Let us know if they're receiving at Goldstone.
Roger, 11. Goldstone is receiving the TV. Stand by. We'll let you know on the quality. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Goldstone says that the TV looks great. Over.
Roger. We're zooming in on the Earth now.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Did you copy? Over.
Roger. We copied, Charlie.
Roger. Your transmissions the last couple of times have been about two-by. Over.
Okay. How do you read me now?
Roger. You're five-by now.
Okay. We're zooming the lens on in until it will just about fill the monitor.
Roger.
Okay. It's in full zoom, now.
Copy, 11.
And how about the f-stop? Is 22 going to be accurate?
Stand by. We'll get with the Goldstone TV guy. We don't have anything here at Houston. Stand by.
It looks good on the monitor, as far as the f-stop goes. Therefore, we just assumed it's okay at Goldstone.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Goldstone says it - TV looks really great, five-by; we don't - The AGC looks like it's working fine. The f:22 is good; we have no real white spots. They're real pleased with it. Over.
Okay. You just cut out, Charlie. We understand that it's looking great. We'll leave it the way it is and wait for you to come back on.
Roger. How do you read me now? Over.
Five-by.
Okay. My comments were - My comments were from Goldstone that they see no white spots as we saw in 10. Looks like the AGC's working real well. The f:22 looks good. Over.
Okay. Very good. Well, we shut out the Sun coming in from the other windows into the spacecraft, so it's looking through a - the number 1 window, and there isn't any reflected light now. So, it ought to be a pretty good picture.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to keep the TV on for about 10 minutes or so, so we can get come good comparison on the camera. You can do anything your heart desires on the TV: interior, exterior, pan in and out, anything you'd like. Over.
11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger. Go ahead. Over.
Charlie, I'm sorry; you keep cutting out. We heard up to "you can do anything," and then after that we didn't hear anything, and we knew that wasn't right anyhow because we can't. But what do you want us to do?
Roger. We'll check this uplink on our voice. That transmission on the TV was - We'd like to get about 10 minutes worth of signal at Goldstone so we can look at the camera quality back here at Houston for about 10 minutes or so when they patch it back into us. What we were saying was that you can go interior or exterior on the camera. On the exterior shots, we'd like to look - -
You cut out again.
Stand by.
Start over with, "we were saying."
Okay, Houston. You suppose you could turn the Earth a little bit so we can get a little bit more than just water?
Roger, 11. I don't think we got much control over that. Looks like you'll have to settle for the water.
11, Houston. We're going to change - thinking about changing our voice uplink to another site. If you'll stand by, we'll see if we can improve the quality. Over.
Okay, Charlie.
We'll stand by for your call.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'll try once more on this TV request. We'd like 10 minutes worth of TV. And we'd like a narrative, if you could give us one, on the exterior shots. You could also - we also suggest you might try the - an interior position. Over.
Roger. We're seeing the center of the Earth as viewed from the spacecraft in the eastern Pacific Ocean. We have not been able to visually pick up the Hawaiian Island chain, but we can clearly see the western coast of North America. The United States, the San Joaquin Valley, the High Sierras, Baja California, and Mexico down as far as Acapulco, and the Yucatan Peninsula; and you can see on through Central America to the northern coast of South America, Venezuela, and Colombia. I'm not sure you'll be able to see all that on your screen down there ...
Roger, Neil. We just wanted a narrative such that we can - When we get the playback, we can sort of correlate what we're seeing. Thank you very much.
I haven't seen anything but the DSKY so far.
Looks like they're hogging the window.
You're right.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. On your CRYO's, we'd like at this time for you to place all four CRYO heaters to AUTO and turn off all four CRYO fans. Over.
Okay. All four CRYO heaters are AUTO. And all four CRYO fans are off . ...
Roger. That's going to be your sleep configuration.
Okay.
And, Buzz, we'll be terminating the battery charge in about a half hour.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate the TV at your convenience. We've got enough take. And you can start PTC at your convenience. The rates look super for starting up. Over.
Roger, Charlie
Apollo 11, Houston. We have a flight plan update for you and some P37 block data, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Stand by.
Okay, Houston. PTC is started now; looks good to us, and we'll be ready to copy in a minute or two.
Roger. Copy, 11.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy the flight plan update and P37.
Roger. Stand by one, Buzz.
Apollo 11, Houston. Coming at you with the P37 block data. Over.
Okay.
Roger. 027 44 5363, minus 165 073 14 037 44 8016, minus 165 072 46; GETI 046 44 6141, minus 165 097 03 055 44 8209, minus 165 096 42. Ready for your readback. Over.
Roger. 027 44 5363, minus 165 073 14 037 44 8016, minus 165 072 46 046 44 6141, minus 165 097 03 055 44 8209, minus 165 096 42. Over.
Roger, 11. That was a good readback. That was the block data scheduled for 12 hours. We'd like to just say that on a flight plan update here, just to remind you of some things, and you can do them at your convenience and then go to sleep early if you'd like. We don't have anything else planned, but we'd like to just remind you on the filter change, the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge. And we'd like a LM/CM DELTA-P and accomplish the presleep checklist.
Okay. We've completed the filter change, and we'll get started on the fuel cell purge, and stand by for the LM/CM DELTA-P.
Roger, 11. Would you hold off on the fuel cell purge? EECOMM is saying we might not have to do that. Over.
Okay.
Charlie, the LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.5.
Copy. 0.5. Out.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've just decided to delete the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge. Over.
Roger. Delete the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've been noting some funnies on the O<sub>2</sub> flow indicator transducer. We've kind of got a suspicion that the transducer - We expected to see an O<sub>2</sub> flow pegged high with the waste stowage vent to VENT. It was not. We also noted some funny indications when you closed the waste stowage vent valve. We're going to continue to take a look at this through the night, and we'll be with you in the morning with an assessment of the problem. Also, we'd like to ask specifically, when you place the waste stowage vent valve to VENT, does the detent - correction - Does the arrow line up with the detent? Over.
Stand by one, Charlie. We'll give you something on the detent.
Roger.
Right now it's at CLOSED, and I lined up with CLOSED before I was at VENT; and best I can recall, it was quite accurately lined up with VENT. Would you like me to go to VENT again momentarily and see where it lines up?
That's negative. That question's answered. Thank you much.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have an S-band configuration for you. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger, Buzz. We'd like you to place the S-band antenna OMNI A switch to the Bravo position. S-band antenna OMNI switch to the OMNI position, the high gain track to MANUAL, and the high gain angles will be yaw 270, pitch minus 50. Over.
Roger. Understand. OMNI to Baker and OMNI, MANUAL. And the angles are yaw 270, pitch minus 50, and was that narrow or wide? Over.
Stand by. Roger. We'd like it in WIDE, and you can set that configuration up now. Over.
It's in work.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate battery Bravo charge, and we'd like a crew status report. We're about to tell you good night. Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. The battery charging is complete, and the crew status report is as follows: radiation, CDR 11002, CMP 10002, LMP 09003; negative medication; fit as a fiddle. Over.
Roger. Copy, 11. Thank you much. We'd like to ask one question. Have you tried the gas separator on the water? How is that working? Over.
Yes. Mike's got a couple of comments on that.
It's working good so far, Charlie. We've got one installed on the water gun and the other one installed on the spigot down in the LEB, and we - mention one problem with them is that they leak at the junction between the food bag and the water filter. However, with that exception, they seem to be working pretty good. We were getting some gas through initially, and I think that was just getting the system purged out to begin with; and the last tubeful we poured was almost free of bubbles. Over.
Roger. Sounds good. We'll check in on that problem with the SPAN guys and let you know in the morning. If you have to call us tonight, we'd like you to do it on DOWNVOICE BACKUP. We're configuring the MSFN for that mode; and as far as we can see, you're cleared for some z's. Over.
Okay. Maybe we'll get around to lunch.
How about a peanut butter and jelly?
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Hope you aren't - we aren't disturbing you. We'd like you to terminate the NOUN 65 now. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11 ...
Roger, Buzz. When you stopped - or, correction - When you terminated the NOUN 65, it appears to us, you get a VERB 46 which collapsed the deadband back to 0.5. We're okay as long as you do not turn on any AUTO RCS SELECT switches. Over.
Okay. I thought that was a - better way to clear the DSKY but evidently it isn't. Roger.
Roger. VERB 34 would have been a better procedure.
Yes. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Good morning, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger, Apollo 11. Good morning.
When you're ready to copy, 11, I've got a couple of small flight plan updates and your consumables update, and the morning news, I guess. Over.
Apollo 11. ...
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. Standing by for your updates. Over.
Okay, 11. This is Houston. At time approximately 22 30 in the flight plan, in your postsleep checklist, and in all other postsleep checklists, we'd like you to delete the statement that says "AUTO RCS JET SELECT, 16 to ON," and what we're doing here is picking this up in the procedure for exiting PTC that's in your CSM checklist. And in the CSM checklist on page Foxtrot 9-8: if you want to turn to that, we'd like to change the order of the steps in that. Over.
Stand by.
Okay. Page F 9-8. Go ahead.
Okay. Right now it reads, "To exit G&N PTC," then you've got a pen-and-ink change that says, "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B." And you come down to the printed step 1. We'd like to take and move the "AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A and B" down to be the second step, so the procedure would read, "Step 1, MANUAL ATTITUDE 3, ACCEL COMMAND; Step 2 AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A B." Step 3 would be, "Verify DAP load," and so on. Over.
Roger. I copy. Is that AUTO RCS SELECT, 12 MAIN A, MAIN B to be the ...
Roger. It should be the second step in that procedure. At time 22 40, or when you get to it, we'd like to commence a charge on battery A. And at time 24 10, we have an updated attitude for your P52 and optics calibration. Over.
Okay. 24 10. Go ahead.
Roger. P52 and optics calibration attitude: roll 330.5, pitch 086.3, yaw 000.0. The nominal attitude that's pen-and-inked in for the P23 is still good. At time 25 30, approximately, after you complete P23, we're requesting a waste-water dump down to a nominal 25 percent. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Did you copy the attitudes and the waste-water dump? Over.
Roger, Bruce. ...
11, this is Houston. We're not reading you at the present time. You're way down in the noise level. Stand by, please.
Okay. Standing by.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Loud and clear. How me?
Okay. Beautiful. Did you copy the attitudes for the P52 and the waste-water dump? Over.
Roger. Okay. We note the battery charge as soon as we get around to it, and the attitude for the P52 optics CAL: roll 330.5, pitch 086.3, and yaw all zeros. The attitude for the P23 as in the flight plan is okay; and I copy your battery charge. Crew status report as follows. Sleep CDR 7, CMP 7, LMP 5.5. And we've completed the postsleep checklist. Standing by for a consumable update. Over.
Roger. We're requesting a waste-water dump at GET 25 30 down to a nominal 25 percent, and here we go with the consumables update. At GET of 22 hours, RCS total is minus 3.5 percent. Alfa minus 3.5 percent, Bravo minus 1.5 percent, Charlie minus 5.0 percent, minus 4.0 percent, H<sub>2</sub> minus 2 pounds, O<sub>2</sub> minus 4 pounds. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
I copied those consumables, and I'll read you back our RCS quantities. We got 86 percent in Alfa, 87 in Bravo, 88 in Charlie, and 90 in Delta. Over.
Roger. I copy.
And did you copy the waste-water request?
Roger. Waste water at - and we got the time on that, and it will be down to 25 percent.
Okay.
Houston, 11.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. We've started charging battery A, and voltage started off a lot higher than I expected. It was just a little bit shy of 40. It looks like it's dropping down some now, the battery charge holder. Seemed to me yesterday when we were doing this on battery C, it started out initially, and it went lower, the battery charge holder. Over.
Roger. Stand by a second, and I'll get some reading on that.
On charging battery A: now, it's at about 393 and - oh, about 1.5 amps. Looks like it's gradually increasing in the ...
Roger. On our CM,.we're showing you at 39.11, and your current's about what you reported.
Okay. I guess you're happy, then.
I think we're losing you in the noise again, 11. Stand by.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Roger, 11. On your battery charging question, we feel that it's probably a difference between individual batteries; and it does seem to have gone away as sort of a startup transient here. Other factors that might conceivably have an influence on it would be battery temperature, things of this sort. EECOMM seems to feel that it's operating within the normal design limits. Over.
All right. Very good. Thank you.
Okay.
11, this is Houston. If you are interested in the morning news, I have a summary here from PAO. Over.
Okay. We're all listening.
Okay. From Jodrell Bank, England, via AP: Britain's big Jodrell Bank radio telescope stopped receiving signals from the Soviet Union's unmanned Moon shot at 5:49 EDT today. A spokesman said that it appeared the Luna 15 space ship "had gone beyond the Moon." Another Quote: "We don't think it has landed," said a spokesman for Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of the Observatory. Washington UPI: Vice President Spiro T. Agnew has called for putting a man on Mars by the year 2000, but Democratic leaders replied that priority must go to needs on Earth. Agnew, ranking government official at the Apollo 11 blastoff Wednesday, apparently was speaking for himself and not necessarily for the Nixon administration when he said, "We should, in my judgment, put a man on Mars by the end of this century." Laredo, Texas, AP: Immigration officials in Nuevo Laredo announced Wednesday that hippies will be refused tourist cards to enter Mexico unless they take a bath and get haircuts. Huberto Cazaras, Chief of Mexican Immigration in Nuevo Laredo, said authorities in Mexico City, Acapulco, and other popular tourist spots have registered complaints about the hippies. By United Press International: Initial reaction to President Nixon's granting of a holiday Monday to Federal employees so they can observe a national day of participation in the Apollo 11 Moon landing mission mostly was one of surprise. Rodney Bidner, Associated Press, London AP: Europe is Moon struck by the Apollo 11 mission. Newspapers throughout the continent fill their pages with pictures of the Saturn V rocket blasting off to forge Earth's first link with its natural satellite. And the headline writers taxed their imagination for words to hail the feat. "The greatest adventure in the history of humanity has started," declared the French newspaper Le Figaro, which devoted four pages to reports from Cape Kennedy and diagrams of the mission. The tabloid Paris Jour proclaimed, "The whole word tells them bravo." The Communists daily L'Humanite led with the launch picture and devoted its entire back page to an enthusiastic Moon report describing the countdown and launch, the astronauts' wives and families, and backgrounding lunar activities. Hempstead, New York: Joe Namath officially reported to the New York Jets training camp at Hofstra University Wednesday following a closed door meeting with his teammates over his differences with pro football Commissioner Peter Rozelle. London UPI: The House of Lords was assured Wednesday that a midget American submarine would not "damage or assault" the Loch Ness monster. Lord Nomay said he wanted to be sure anyone operating a submarine in the Loch "would not subject any creatures that might inhabit it to damage or assault." He asked that the submarine's plan to take a tissue sample with a retrievable dart from any monster it finds can be done without damage and disturbance. He was told it was impossible to say if the 1876 Cruelty to Animals Act would be violated unless and until the monster found. Over.
Roger. Thank you, Bruce. Another thing on that number 2 item, we all ... before we left, and we hope we get a chance to see him another time. Over.
Roger. And I understand he was down there and really enjoyed watching the launch. We all think it was pretty magnificent, and you all are doing great job up there.
Thank you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Mike, we've got some comments on performance of P23 for today if you've got a minute to talk.
He's all ears.
Yes. Go ahead.
Okay. For today, we'd like you on P23 to make a trunnion bias determination, prior to P23 sightings as called out in procedures, and also one afterwards. Our intent here is to check out the possibility that some sort of thermal effect may be giving you errors in the angular read-out in the sextant. The bias that you get beforehand should be incorporated, that is a PROCEED on NOUN 87 after you get two consecutive measurements equal to within 0.003 degrees. And, of course, move the trunnion off a couple of degrees between the measurements. The Earth should be a lot smaller in your field of view today. I'm , sure you're a lot more qualified to tell us about that than we are, but to ensure that you're getting a good angle measurement between the star and the Earth horizon, the sextant M-line, which is the line that runs through the two hash marks and is perpendicular to the R-line, should be parallel to the Earth horizon at the substellar point. And then the actual superimposition of the star upon the horizon can be made at any point in the field of view of the sextant: above, below, or on the M-line. We recommend the marks be made as rapidly as possible after AUTO maneuver. If you feel that the amount of time between the AUTO maneuver and the time you get ready to mark is excessive, or that you don't like that AUTO maneuver attitude when you get ready to mark, of course, you can use a VERB 94 - VERB 94 to get you back to the flashing 51 position to redo the AUTO maneuvers. Over.
Roger. Stand by one. We're going to stop PTC, and then we'll talk about this P23.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Okay. We're stopping PTC now and maneuvering to our P52 and optics CAL attitude. In regard to that P23, what I was trying to tell you yesterday was about that. The M-line is not anywhere parallel to the horizon at the roll, pitch, and yaw which you gave me to go to for the substellar point, and I was trying to maneuver off to get it parallel to the horizon when you all said that was not necessary.
Roger, 11. I guess in keeping the cups of coffee score, why you get that one.
Well - Okay - Well, this morning, let's just see how close it comes to being parallel to the M-line. Before we started marking for the first time, it appeared that the computation of - of those three angles was somewhat off, and that I was wasting a lot of gas by going to those three angles and then having to make large attitude changes after that to get the M-line parallel. In some cases it appeared to be just an accepted attitude required, and you all said that it wasn't needed. So I was marking in some cases with the M-line not parallel. I thought perhaps you had some processor for computing that offset and making sense out of that data, but as far as I know, we've got to have the M-line parallel to the horizon.
Roger, 11. We don't have that capability. We do require that the M-line be parallel to the horizon in order to get a good mark. We feel that possibly the - the state vector information that you were using for your maneuver basis yesterday may have needed to be updated a little. And if you'll standby a second, we'll give you an evaluation of what we feel you'll get today by the AUTO maneuver.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. I'm getting ready to do an O<sub>2</sub> Fuel cell purge. Do you have any particulars on this? And I assume you want these one at a time, or can I triple up? Over.
We'd like them one at a time, and stand by. I don't think we have any sequence. You can do them in any order you want.
Okay.
And we're watching you on TM down here.
Houston, Apollo 11. You want to look at these NOUN 93's before I proceed on?
Yes, please. Stand by a second.
Okay.
11, this is Houston. On our TM, here, we're only seeing values in two registers. Can you read us out the contents of register 3, please?
Register 3: minus three balls 24.
Roger. Minus three balls 24. And you can go ahead and proceed.
Okay. Proceeding at this time.
11, Houston. After you've completed P52, we'd like to uplink you a new state vector so we can start out clean on this P23. Over.
Okay.
Houston, are you observing the higher O<sub>2</sub> flow on fuel cell 3?
Houston, Apollo 11. It's triggered the MASTER ALARM three times, now. There goes number 4. It goes up to about 1.4, then oscillates back down to about 1.1. Over.
Roger. We saw them 1.3 now on TM. Stand by a second.
And we're in P00, now, for a state vector.
Roger. Give us ACCEPT, please.
Roger. Done.
11, Houston. On your O<sub>2</sub> flow, fuel cell 3: apparently it was flowing a little higher than the other two during purge, but the flow rate is acceptable. Over.
Roger, It seems to be flowing a little bit more, and actually putting out more current than the other two, also. Over.
Roger. We copy.
11, this is Houston. We've completed the uplink; the computer is yours; you can go back to BLOCK.
Okay. Thank you.
Go ahead, 11.
Houston, 11. I don't believe we were calling you right then,
Roger. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. I'm in a good attitude here to do - I have in the sextant this last P52 star, star 37. Is that all right for the optics calibration to save some gas, or do you want to go over to star 40?
Star 37 will be fine for the optics calibration. And we haven't noticed a VERB 66, yet, after our state vector uplink. Over.
Okay.
When you move into P23, we recommend that you use the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver and see how that works out. If it doesn't bring you up with the M-line parallel to the horizon to the substellar point, we will see if we can get you some ground-computed angles. I guess the big thing here is to make sure that the M-line is parallel to substellar points so we can get a good angular measurement. Over.
Yes. I believe.
Roger. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Marking on this star, I get a NOUN 87 twice in a row of five balls, so that's sufficient for a count.
That's certainly very sufficient.
Okay. Now I want to go to P00, and I am going to take your three angles and do a verify of 49 maneuver to your substellar point. Okay?
Okay. We recommend that for the first star, if we gave you a new state vector, we'd like to try the CMC-computed angles for your AUTO maneuver.
Okay.
And have you hit PROCEED on this display to enter the zero?
Not yet.
Okay.
11, Houston. Over the past 2 hours we have seen a slight continuing increase in partial pressure Of CO<sub>2</sub>. Have you in fact changed the CO<sub>2</sub> canister yet this morning? We don't need to do it right now; we'd just like to confirm it on our instrumentation - is in good shape. Over.
No. We haven't changed any canisters this morning.
Okay. Then you can plan on accomplishing that after P23 is over and you've got the LEB clear.
All right.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're in process of maneuvering to P23 in desired attitude. It likes roll 8.37, pitch 61.33, and yaw 339.87. Over.
Roger. We copy. And that is for star 01?
Star 01, right near the horizon. Code 110.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. On this star, the AUTO maneuver works just fine. I am right at the substellar point. Everything looks beautiful except there is no star in sight. It is just not visible.
Roger. Is this for star 01?
That's correct.
You are not getting any reflections or anything like that that would obscure your vision, are you?
Well, of course, the Earth is pretty bright, and the black sky, instead of being black, has sort of a rosy glow to it. The star, unless it is a very bright one, is probably lost somewhere in that glow, but it is just not visible. I maneuvered the reticle considerably above the horizon to make sure that the star is not lost in the brightness below the horizon. However, even when I get the reticle considerably above the horizon so the star should be seen against the black background, it still is not visible.
Roger. We copy. Standby a minute, please.
11, this is Houston. Can you read us the shaft and trunnion angle off the counters?
Yes. I will be glad to. Shaft 331.2 and trunnion 35.85.
Roger. Thank you.
It's really a fantastic sight through that sextant. A minute ago, during that AUTO maneuver, the reticle swept across the Mediterranean. You could see all of North Africa, absolutely clear; all of Portugal, Spain, southern France; all of Italy, absolutely clear. Just a beautiful sight.
Roger. We all envy you the view up there.
But still no star.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Bruce.
On our ground computers we confirm the shaft and trunnion angle that you have as being pointed at the star. However, it looks as though that shaft and trunnion angle is also pointing into the structure of the LM, so that while you will be getting the Earth's horizon, the star ... is obscured by the LM. We recommend an AUTO maneuver to the attitudes pen-and-inked into the flight plan. Roll 1772, pitch 2982 and yaw 330.0. Over.
Okay. Fine. Let ts try that.
...
11, this is Houston. While you're maneuvering, could we get a /CM DELTA-P reading from you? Over.
Roger. Just a tad under 1, Bruce, 0.95.
Roger. 0.95.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Is the Commander aboard?
This is the Commander.
I was a little worried. This is the backup Commander still standing by. You haven't given me the word yet. Are you GO?
You've lost your chance to take this one, Jim.
Okay. I concede.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Okay. Our maneuver is complete, and at this attitude the M-line is exactly 90 degrees out of phase. It is exactly pointed along the vector toward the center of the Earth instead of being parallel to the right.
Roger.
I'm going to hold right here for your next suggestion.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. It appears to be okay now; We've changed our attitude slightly, and I have a star and I'm maneuvering to get the M-line parallel.
This is Houston. Roger. We copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. You - Stand by one.
Houston, Apollo 11. Are you copying these NOUN 49's that have been going through?
Yes. We surely are. Let's see: plus 0.1 and a plus 0.2 on nautical miles and feet per second. Over.
Roger.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Yes, Mike. We show you in VERB 59 right now. Over.
That's right. I - I haven't entered - I gave the - I gave it back to the computer for a second. I put the mode switch from MANUAL back to CMC while I fooled with the DSKY, and the computer drove the star off out of sight. So the delay here has been in going back to MANUAL and finding the star again, which I've finally done. And - Just a second here, I'll go to ENTER and get a 51 and mark on it. As I say, for some reason the computer drove the star off out of sight.
Okay. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. We show you as a little less than an hour to the midcourse correction number 2 burn. We recommend that you terminate the P23 activities here and press on with the waste-water dump, which we need from you, and get it ready for the burn. Over.
Okay.
And I have your midcourse correction number 2 PAD when you're ready to copy.
Stand by.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11, ready to copy MCC 2.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Midcourse correction number 2. SPS/G&N 63059, plus 097, minus 020, GET ignition 02644 5792, plus 00118, minus 00003, plus 00177, roll 277 355 015, NOUN 44 BLOCK is NA, DELTA-VT 00213 003 00168, sextant star 30 2082 370. The rest of the PAD is NA. GDC align: Vega and Deneb. Roll align 007 144 068. No ullage. LM weight: 33302. For your information, your heads will be pointed roughly towards the Earth on this burn. Read back. Over.
Roger. Midcourse correction number 2. SPS/G&N: 63059, plus 097, minus 020 02644 5792, plus 00118, minus 00003, plus 00177 277 - Are you still copying?
Roger. Still copying. Go ahead. Apollo 11, this is Houston. I copied your transmission about roll 277, and go ahead from roll 277. Over.
Roger. 355 015, NA, 00213 003 00168 30 2082 370. Vega and Deneb 007 144 068. No ullage. LM weight: 33302. Heads towards the Earth. Over.
11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger. We'd like you to terminate battery A at GET 26 hours and reinitiate battery A charge after midcourse correction 2. Over.
Apollo 11. Roger.
Roger. Out.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. If you can give us ACCEPT, we'll send you up a state vector and a target load for the maneuver.
Okay. Give us 1 minute to check the P23 damage.
Sure thing.
Houston, Apollo 11. The DSKY's yours.
Houston. Roger. Out.
11, this is Houston. We've completed the uplink. The computer's yours.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Wonder if you have a star that might be a little closer to the direction we're burning than the one you gave us.
Roger. We're going to rework the attitude in the sextant star for you in order to improve the high-gain antenna coverage, and we'll have that for you in a few seconds.
Fine. We're already maneuvering ...
Roger.
Maybe you can make it just the change in roll.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. On your attitude for the burn: we'd like you to use roll 096, pitch 356, yaw 018. That will give you a sextant star of 01, shaft 253.8, trunnion 24.2. Over.
... 356 ...
11, this is Houston. We are having difficulty reading you through the noise. Could you read back again, please? Over.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Do you copy?
Roger. Very weakly in the noise, but I think I can copy. Go ahead.
Okay. Roll 096 356 018 ... star 01 ...
Roger. I got all of that except trunnion. It's trunnion 242. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read me now on OMNI A?
Roger. Loud and clear, 11.
Okay. We'll stay on OMNI A for a while, then.
Okay. I got all your readback except the value for trunnion. If it's 242, confirm, please.
Roger. 242.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you give us a couple of high-gain antenna angles, please?
Roger. Stand by, 11.
Roger, 11. Pitch minus 35, yaw 0. Over.
Thank you.
We got them.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read high gain?
Read you loud and clear on high gain down here, and everything's looking good from our standpoint for your burn. Over.
Okay, Bruce.
Houston, burn completed. You copying our residuals?
That's affirmative.
And, Houston, looked like we saw about 87 or 88 psi on chamber pressure that time. I'd like you to look at that on the ground.
Roger, 11. We'll take a look at that and get back in a few minutes.
11, Houston. On our real-time telemetry we saw 95 to 97 psi on chamber pressure. We'll - We will look at the recordings down here, thought, and get back with you again. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
And we've copied your residuals, 11.
Roger. No, we're not going to trim those ...
11, Houston. Could we get your DELTA-V counter reading, please, from this burn?
That's minus 3.8.
Minus 2.8?
3.8.
Roger. Copy minus 3.8.
Houston, is there anything else you need on the burn status report?
This is Houston. Negative, 11.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Apollo 11.
Roger. I just wanted to remind you that we haven't noticed on the TM the VERB 66 after the burn. And for your information, we played the recorded TV back last night, I believe, after you all turned in for your rest period, and the pictures came out quite well. Over.
Did you get any usable pictures out of MILA on that first pass?
Not that we've seen. We had word on the voice loop that MILA reported that they had gotten a minute's worth of TV signal, and Goldstone reported that they had gotten about a minute's worth of modulation but that they weren't able to get anything off of it.
Okay. Thanks.
Okay. We have another input here, 11, that the MILA data was recognizable as a picture, but we don't have any evaluation as to the quality of the picture. Over.
Okay.
And for our information, we've been watching a PCO<sub>2</sub> again. Did you change a lithium hydroxide canister this morning? Over.
Yes. We did, and we've been seeing 1.7 percent in the spacecraft ever since.
Roger. That agrees with our data.
1.7 millimeters.
Roger. We copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're starting our maneuver to PTC attitude.
Roger.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. From a propellant-balancing standpoint, we recommend that you use quads Alfa and Bravo to start the PTC maneuvers. Over.
Roger. Understand Alfa and Bravo.
Roger. Out.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. For CRYO-balancing purposes, we'd like you to turn the heater and oxygen tank number 1 off at this time. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
Everything else in the CRYO system remains the same.
Okay.
Okay. We have O<sub>2</sub> heater tank 1 off.
Houston. Roger. Out.
How is EECOMM today? Is he happy with all those good things?
Oh, EECOMM is happy, and after you get PTC set up, we've got a little procedure from EECOMM here to check out the O<sub>2</sub> flow and the O<sub>2</sub> flow sensor in your cabin enrichment. Over.
Okay.
It'll be a while, Bruce. We're just now arriving in PTC attitude, and we're going to our 20 minutes of monitoring thruster activity.
Roger. We copy. He'll be here.
Houston, Apollo 11. Are you going to take control of the OMNI's now and switch us between B and D?
This is Houston. Stand by one.
11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Mike, how about selecting Bravo at this time, and I'll give you a COMP configuration here, shortly.
Okay.
That PTC sure worked well last night.
Outstanding.
11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Roll for the COMM situation: have S-band antenna OMNI A in Bravo, S-band antenna OMNI to OMNI, high-gain track to MANUAL, and the pitch is minus 50 and yaw is 270.
You may have to repeat some of that, James. We've got a LM guy taking care of the high gain right now.
Yes, and he is eyeballing the Earth.
He's got his head out the window.
I understand, I had trouble on 12 with him, too.
Say again what you'd like.
Okay, The S-band antenna OMNI A switch to Bravo which you have now, and S-band antenna OMNI to the OMNI position, and the high-gain track to the MANUAL position, and the pitch and yaw angles are minus 50 for pitch and yaw is 270.
Minus 50 and 270.
Hey, Jim, I'm looking through the monocular now, and to coin an expression, the view is just beautiful. It's out of this world. I can see all the islands in the Mediterranean. Some larger and smaller islands of Majorca, Sardinia, and Corsica. A little haze over the upper Italian peninsula, some cumulus clouds out over Greece. The Sun is setting on the eastern Mediterranean now. The British Isles are definitely greener in color than the brownish green that we have in the islands, in the peninsula of Spain. Over.
Roger. I understand that the Northern Africa - Mediterranean area is fairly clear today, huh?
Right.
Yes. We see a bunch of roads with cars driving up and down, too.
Do you find that the monocular is any good to you, Buzz?
Yes, It would be nicer if it had another order of magnitude of power on it. Of course, it has a tendency to jiggle around a little bit, and you might want to have some sort of a bracket. I hate to use that word though.
Got an anticyclone going in the southern hemisphere southeast of Brazil, and some - Well, the diameter of it must be over 2000 miles across.
How does the weather look up in the southern part of the western hemisphere, or up in the United States area?
Well, you all are just beginning to come over the limb now. I can see parts of Central America, and it looks to be fairly clear there. The islands in the Caribbean are beginning to come in and rather a few streaming lines of clouds. Looks like there is a system up to the - well, off of Greenland that has some large cloud streamers extending back down to the southwest. The east coast of the U.S. is just coming into view now, and it doesn't look too bad that I can see right now. We may have some pretty good shots later on this afternoon. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
I've got a comment about the point on the Earth where the Sun's rays reflect back up toward us. In general, the color of the oceans is mostly uniform and it's bright and darker blue except for that region that's about one-eighth of an Earth's radius in diameter; and in this circular area, the blue of the water turns a grayish color, and I'm sure that's where the Sun's rays are being reflected back on up toward us. Over.
Roger, Buzz. We noticed the same thing. It's very similar to looking at a light shining on something like a billiard ball or a bowling ball. You get this bright spot in the blue of the water, and that turns it to sort of a grayish color.
Yes. Is there a Navy term for that?
(Laughing.) A lot of gray paint.
11, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Mike, are you satisfied with P23 now?
Yes, I'm happy with the last updates we got, you know, in terms of what it did to our state vector. Still not altogether happy with the various procedures. If we could pick stars within the smaller range of trunnion angles so that you could allow P23 to pick its own maneuver and go to that substellar point and then have that star visible, that would seem to me to be the simplest and best way to do it.
How about the - -
... correction on that last ...
How about the horizon now? Is it pretty well defined for you and no longer hazy?
Yes. We're far enough out now that the - I think the horizon definition variation is lost in the North.
Hey, Jim.
Go ahead, Buzz.
Looks like the best way to get a steady view through the monocular is just steady it out and let it close when it's in front of your eye, and then you kind of float up next to it so that you're not touching it at all. It has a very slow drift, and you get a better - steadier view that way.
Sounds good.
How does it feel to be airborne again, Buzz?
Well, I'll tell you, I've been having a ball floating around inside here, back and forth up to one place and back to another. It's like being outside, except more comfortable.
It's a lot bigger than our last vehicle.
... kept me busy, I'm ...
Say again about Buzz -
Yes. It sure is nice in here.
I said it's a lot bigger than the last vehicle that Buzz and I were in.
Oh, yes. It's been nice. I've been very busy so far. I'm looking forward to taking the afternoon off. I've been cooking, and sweeping, and almost sewing, and you know, the usual little housekeeping things.
It was very convenient the way they put the food preparation system right next to the NAV station.
Everything is right next to everything in this vehicle.
Not if you're in the ...
Jim, it's been a little warm in the machine throughout yesterday and last night during the PTC. It cooled off somewhat with the windows buttoned up, and we've seen suit temperatures of about - the high 40's and cabin temperatures in the low 60's. But this seems to be still a little bit on the warm side.
I understand that it got a little warm during the day and cooled down a little bit when you put the shades up, but you're still a little bit warm. Do you have any moisture condensation or anything like that on the wall?
No, we haven't been able to detect any moisture anyplace in the spacecraft. It seems to be fine.
One of the hydrogen filters - the one that we've got on the hot water - seems to keep flowing when you remove one of the food bags from it. Its flow rate is quite small, right near the end of one out, and that contributes a little bit of moisture to the atmosphere.
Yes, that hydrogen thing, it's - I'm not sure, but I think it's a backpressure problem. If the thing sees any backpressure at all, like when the bag is attached, well the flow rate will slowly decrease to where it's almost zero, and you wait, and you wait, and you wait for that last ounce. You think you have its and you remove the bag, and then you very rapidly thereafter see maybe a glob the size of a dime or a quarter come out and just hang there. That appears to be true even though the opening into the bag is not restricted.
Understand.
In general, I think they do quite a good job, especially on the guns, in removing a lot of the hydrogen bubbles.
Have the water temperatures been good? Are you getting hot water?
Yes. It seems reasonably warm.
We made three cups of coffee today. The last one - you know when all the plumbing was warmed up, the hydrogen gun and everything, was warmest of the three. I don't know who had that one - Neil, did you have that one? How was your coffee? You didn't drink it till later, did you? Anyway, it's pretty good. It's not piping hot, but it sure beats stone-cold coffee.
Jim, we've been sitting here a little over 20 minutes now, How does the thruster firing activity look? Are you ready to go on with this PTC?
Roger. Stand by.
We're all set to go, Mike.
Okay. I'll press on then.
Houston, Apollo 11. PTC has started and it looks good.
11, Roger. This is Houston. Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. If you're free for a couple of minutes, we have a procedure here that will let us verify the O<sub>2</sub> flow transducer and at the same time get some more of our cabin enrichment out of the way. Over.
Stand by.
Go ahead, Houston. We're ready to copy.
Roger. The primary purpose of this is, as I mentioned, to let us check out your O<sub>2</sub> flow transducer. However, we still need about 2 hours' worth of cabin enrichment, so we'd like to keep the vent that we're going to set up going for this purpose. Okay. We want you to install the cabin vent quick disconnect which you'll find in compartment R-6, that is Romeo 6, on the urine connector on panel 251. When this is completed, verify that the waste stowage vent valve is closed, and then open or position the waste management overboard drain to the DUMP position. Over.
Okay. Understand that. Install the cabin quick disconnect out of R-6 on the 251 urine connector and verify that the waste dump valve is closed, and say again the last part.
Roger. And then put the waste management overboard drain valve into the DUMP position. Over.
Roger. Put the waste management overboard drain valve to the DUMP position.
Right. That's the one down on panel 251 also. And we'll watch your O<sub>2</sub> flow on telemetry down here.
Okay, Houston. That configuration is set up.
11, this is Houston. Say again, please.
You do have the O<sub>2</sub> flow transducer checkout setup accomplished.
Okay. Understand you have opened the drain valve at this time.
That's ... It's in DUMP.
Roger. We're not getting telemetry data from you right due to low signal strength. There it comes back. I expect it'll probably take us anywhere from 15 minutes to half an hour to see an increase in O<sub>2</sub> flow due to the size of the cabin and of course of the small size of the drain. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. I've got the world in my window for a change and looking at it through the monocular, it's really something. I wish I could describe it properly. The weather is very good. South America is coming around into view. I can see on the - what appears to me to be upper horizon, a point that must be just about Seattle, Washington, and from there I can see all the way down to the southern tip of Tierra del Fuego and the southern tip of the continent.
Roger. Sounds like you've got a beautiful view up there.
Absolutely fantastic. I hope the pictures come out. We,re rotating around where it's going out of view again.
I'm waiting to pick it up in the sextant.
Sounds like one of these rotating restaurants.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Do you need some help keeping OMNI's locked on us?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Negative. We had a command computer at the Madrid site go down. We had to switch over to Ascension temporarily. We're now back remoting through Madrid, and the computer is back, and we're ready to resume control of your OMNI's and full communication. Over.
Okay. You've got it.
Okay. One thing that we did miss in the dropout in the noise here is your LM/CM DELTA-P reading for about 28 hours GET. Over.
Okay. The LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.98.
Roger. 0.98, and what have you been reading for O<sub>2</sub> flow on your onboard gage? Over.
Well, right now, after we put that gadget in, we've got it back to 0.35. Before that, we were reading on scale level. I think ours is relatively correct, at least when time comes for the water accumulator to kick in at 10 seconds, it goes on up to about 0.75, 0.8, something like that.
This is Houston. Roger. Out.
And, 11, this is Houston. A little more information based on our analysis of your last SPS burn: it looks like you got a good solid burn there. We show 94 psi chamber pressure and it looks like the SPS is definitely GO. Over.
Good to hear it.
Roger. We thought you'd feel that way about it.
We're right in the middle of - well either ... or salmon salad, or something like that. That's probably why we're not answering you right away.
Okay. Well, we don't want - -
My compliments to the chef, that salad salmon is outstanding.
Roger. Understand that's the salad salmon. Over.
Something like that, salmon salad.
There we go, the salmon salad, very good.
Okay. Bruce, we're coming up on the water accumulator activity, and it's going on up to 0.85, oh, about 0.95 and it reached a peak there and then gradually dropped back on down to 0.6 now, 0.4, and it looks like it's pretty well - pretty well leveling off back down to 0.35. Over.
Roger, We're copying that.
11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. On that 2O flow transducer down here on telemetry, our values are agreeing pretty well with what you read out onboard, and the EECOMM's have been noticing this cycle, but it still looks like the indicated rate is lower than what we would expect. We're still working on the problem, and we'll let you have a more complete diagnosis on it in a little while.
Okay. It's a tight fix then.
We run a tight ship.
Roger. Is that music I hear in the background?
Buzz in singing.
Okay.
Pass me the sausage, man.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, 11. We've been watching your activity on the DSKY there, and by selecting another major program with a VERB 37 ENTER and all that, we show you collapsing the deadband in PTC and having driven the CMC rate from 0.3 degrees per second down to 0 degrees per second, although of course, with all the AUTO RCS coils shut off, you're not firing any thrusters. Over.
Okay. What do you recommend?
Well, you can just continue in your present configuration in PTC. However, if you go to turn any thrusters on, the CMC would then try to bring you into an attitude hold position rather than continuing with the PTC. Over.
Roger. I understand.
Okay.
And, Houston, we're just looking at you out our window here. Looks like there's a circulation of clouds that just moved east of Houston over the Gulf and Florida area. Did that have any rain in it this morning?
Roger. Our report from outside says that it's raining out here, and looks like you've got a pretty good eye for the weather there.
Yes. Well, it looks like it ought to clear up pretty soon from our viewpoint. The western edge of the weather isn't very far west of you.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, this is Houston. As a result of our venting through the waste management drain, we've concluded that your O<sub>2</sub> flow rate sensor is, in fact, malfunctioning. I mentioned when you talked us through the cyclic water accumulator dump that even though it was moving, probably indicating a higher flow rate, it didn't seem to be indicating a flow rate that is high enough; and based on that and the flow that we're getting right now, we've concluded that the transducer is malfunctioning. We'd like to continue the O<sub>2</sub> flow for about another hour, shutting it off at about 31 hours GET, to get the O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the vehicles up to - in the vehicles up to where it will be acceptable for LM checkout. Over.
Okay. Does it look to you like it just has a bias on it?
Roger, 11. It does seem to be a bias. Looks like it has a fairly high threshold before it starts indicating. EECOMM seems to think, though, that for high flow rate purposes, it will still give you a relative indication during the mission. Over.
Okay. We understand. Thank you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We would like you to terminate charging on battery A at GET 30 plus 15. Over.
Okay. 30 plus 15 for battery A charge terminate.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. If you're free for a minute, I've got some updates to the P37 PAD's that we passed up to you yesterday afternoon, I guess. As a result of doing midcourse correction number 2, the DELTA-V required in the TLI plus 35, 44, and 53 PAD's have changed slightly. Over.
Roger. Standing by to copy.
Okay. TLI plus 35 PAD: the DELTA-VT should be 7992 instead of 8016. TLI plus 44 - It should be 6112 instead of 6141. And TLI plus 53 - It should be 8172 instead of 8209. Read back. Over.
Roger. Understand. 7992, 6112, 8172. Over.
Roger. Readback correct. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, this is Houston. Goldstone reports they are receiving a TV picture coming down from you all, a little snowy, but a good TV picture. Over.
Roger. We're just testing the equipment up here.
Roger.
Ask them if they can read the numbers.
Okay. Stand by.
Goldstone, this is Houston CAP COMM. Over.
Houston CAP COMM, Goldstone M&O. Go ahead.
Roger. Stand by a minute, Goldstone.
11, this is Houston. What numbers are you referring to? Over.
Well, I guess if they can't see any numbers, why, it's kind of a lost cause.
Negative. Standby. We wanted to know - -
...
We wanted to know what numbers before we asked them.
Okay. I'm showing them the DSKY, and I'd like to know whether they can read what's showing on the DSKY, and also whether they can see P-R-O-G, V-E-R-B, and N-O-U-N. Over.
Roger. Stand by a second.
Goldstone M&O, Houston CAP COMM. Over.
CAP COMM, Goldstone. Go ahead.
Roger. Did you copy the spacecraft request?
That's affirmative. I am reading the numbers on our monitor here.
Okay, that's - Roger. That's both the numbers on the DSKY itself, and the little words like PROGRAM and VERB, NOUN, COMPUTER ACTIVITY, things of this sort?
Roger. I can read the numbers clearly. We can't distinguish what the words are, because it is a little snowy.
Roger.
Okay. I read VERB, NOUN, and PROGRAM.
Roger. Do you see - Over in the lefthand corner, there's a big square one that says COMPUTER ACTIVITY, COMP ACTIVITY?
Roger. I see a flash occasionally in that area.
Roger. that's the one.
Okay. It looks like he's moved the camera at this time.
Roger.
11, this is Houston. Goldstone M&O reports that they can read the numbers on the DSKY. They can also read VERB, NOUN, PROGRAM, and see the COMP ACTIVITY light flashing. Over.
Very good. Thank you.
And they also report you appear to have panned the camera over to another location now.
Yes, we're going to work on something else.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Oh, Charlie. That you?
That's me. How are you there?
Oh, Just fine. How's the old White Team today?
Oh, the old White Team's bright-eyed and bushytailed. We're ever alert down here.
Ever alert and ... Hey, you got any medics down there watching high grade? I'm trying to do some running in place down here, and I'm wondering just out of curiosity whether it brings my heart rate up.
Well, they will spring into action here momentarily. Stand by.
Hello, 11. We see your heart beating.
Okay, Well - look at the CDR's and the CMP's and see if they go up any. We're all running in place up here. You wouldn't believe it.
I'd like to see that sight. Why don't you give us a TV picture of that one.
I think Buzz is trying. You got it.
Okay. It's coming in at Goldstone, Buzz. As Bruce, said, we don't have it here in the center.
I'm afraid this isn't going to help out the PTC very much.
Yes. I don't know if it's a vibration or what it is, but it makes the pitch and yaw rate needles on FDAI number 1 jump up and down a little bit where we jump up and down.
Roger. Goldstoners say they see you running there, Mike.
Okay.
Ask him what he's running from.
11, Houston. Mike, we see about a 96 heartbeat now.
Okay. Thank you.
Well, that's about all that is reasonable, without getting hot and sweaty.
Roger. We copy.
Goldstone should be getting about the best picture of the Earth we can give them right now, Charlie.
Roger, Mike. Thank you much.
We've got a tittle distortion in the horizontal direction from banding on our monitor. I wonder if they're getting the same thing?
Stand by, Buzz. I'll let you know.
I guess it would be more described as a waviness.
Goldstone M&O, Houston CAP COMM.
Goldstone M&O.
Okay. The crew is complaining of some horizontal banding on their monitor. Do you see that on the picture?
Stand by.
They wouldn't see anything now. We don't have anything in focus, Charlie.
Roger. He's checking on it. I'll see if they had it earlier. Stand by.
I guess when we're showing the DSKY or when we're showing the Earth might be the better time.
Okay.
Houston CAP COMM, Goldstone.
Go ahead.
Okay. Our TV people confirm they see this horizontal band.
Okay.
11, Houston. The Goldstone TV people also see the banding when - at the same time you do. Over.
Okay. Would they call it a horizontal waviness, instead of banding, maybe?
I'm not talking to them directly. Stand by, Buzz. Let me see how they describe it.
Goldstone M&O, Houston CAP COMM. Could you put the TV guy on the loop, please?
CAP COMM, Goldstone. Roger.
Houston CAP COMM, Goldstone M&O NET 1.
Go.
The TV people do not have access to NET 1 in that area. Suggest we use NET 2 For that purpose.
Okay. Going to NET 2.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV guys say they have some horizontal banding across the upper part of the picture and across the lower part. They would consider the lines just straight, no waviness to them at all. Over.
Roger. Understand. They do seem to distort vertical lines though.
Say again about the vertical lines, Buzz.
Roger. When there's a vertical line, these horizontal bands tend to put small waves in it.
Roger. I copy. He didn't mention that. Stand by, I'll check again.
Hello, 11. Houston. The Goldstone TV said that when you get a sharp vertical line on the picture, when the horizontal banding goes across, it does appear to bend it slightly. The same as Apollo 10, they said. Looks okay to them. Over.
Okay. Understand. It's not our monitor. It must be the transmitter or the system.
Roger. I guess so, Buzz. We'll have them look into it, and see if they can suggest anything.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've lost our command interface with Goldstone. We'd like you to switch to OMNI Delta. Over.
Roger. Going to Delta.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to terminate the O<sub>2</sub> purge if you have not done so already, and the TV camera people say that the lines are inherent in the camera, Buzz; and it's something that we expected. Over.
Roger. Understand about the camera. Say again about the O<sub>2</sub> purge.
Roger. We can terminate the O<sub>2</sub> purge at this time. Over.
Oh, okay. Fine. Will do.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Please select OMNI Bravo on board. Over.
Okay. Going to Bravo, Charlie.
Roger.
How's everything going down there? You guys happy with the spacecraft systems?
Roger. Affirmative. Everything's looking really good to us. Over.
Okay. Same here.
Charlie, how far out can you pick up TV off the OMNI?
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're just about to the limits where we can get any kind of picture at all on the OMNI's on the TV. It - The picture, I guess, would be just almost zero at this point.
Okay. Well, for this TV program coming up in a couple of hours, you might give some thought to how you want us to stop PTC, if you do, for the best high gain angle; and also it would be nice if you could stop us at such an attitude that we'd have the Earth out of one of our windows.
Roger, 11. We're thinking about that.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got some PIPA biases and general drift updates for you if you give us P00 and ACCEPT. Over.
Okay, Charlie. Stand by one.
Roger, 11. The - -
You've got it.
Okay. Thank you much. Our biggest drift on the GYRO's is 0.03 degrees per hour with - on the X-GYRO. On the PIPA's, the Y-PIPA's the biggest and it's 0.006 feet per second so ... trying to tweak it up. The biggest we have is about one sigma on both GYRO's and accelerometers.
Sounds good.
The system really looks good to us.
Glad to hear it, Charlie.
11, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK. We've got the load in.
Okay. Roger.
Boy, you sure get a different perspective in this thing in zero g. Right now, Neil's got his feet on the forward hatch, and he can with his arms reach - all five windows, He can reach down into - the LEB where the overboard drain is. He can practically reach over in the cockpit.
Sounds like Plastic Man to me.
I'm hiding under the left-hand couch trying to stay out of his way.
Be a good idea, Mike.
Houston, Apollo 11. You got a cloud over the Houston area right now?
Roger. We just had a really big thunderstorm here about a hour ago. Couple of storms around the area ... Over.
Yes. I see one fairly large and isolated one. There are couple of more off to the left, but this one looks fairly good size. It could very well be the one that just passed over you.
Roger.
Yes, and it looks like the Cape has been having a little bit of rain, too.
Roger. The one we had here came in from the west and is moving east - or nearly so, as far as I could tell.
That view through this sextant is fantastic. I can see Alaska right up - right up along the LM, and I'm running the crosshairs right now down the coast of California, the west coast of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula, up around the Gulf, Florida, Cuba, down Central America, and I'm running into the stop right now, on the sextant.
Roger. It sounds like a pretty fantastic view.
The guys in the weather office at Patrick wanted a report on the tops but I guess all we can say is we're above them.
Roger. We'll pass it on to METRO.
11, Houston. Do you see any predominant weather systems as far as frontal type or any buildup of tropical-storm type? Over.
Not any large ones. There are a couple of smaller disturbances. Well, there's one maybe 300 miles north of Cuba, but it doesn't look cyclonic.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got a TV attitude for you and also an update to your CMC erasable load and your alternate contingency checklist, if you could break that out too. Over.
Roger. I'm not sure I caught all of that. Go ahead with what you have.
Roger, 11. If you'll break out your alternate and contingency checklist for the CSM, we got an update to some of the erasable loads on page F2-20, Over.
Okay. Be getting that out, and you can give us the attitude for TV.
Roger, 11. Your TV attitude will be roll 261, pitch 090, yaw 000. High gain angle: pitch plus 28, yaw 271. That puts the left-hand window pointed at the Earth. We recommend exiting PTC with your updated procedure in the checklist. Over.
Roger. We copy roll 21 - 61, pitch 090, yaw 000, high gain pitch plus 28, yaw 271. And we'll like this with the DELTA-V that we have in the book. Over.
That's affirmative.
Charlie, Apollo 11. I have a couple of questions on stopping the PTC. It seems to me the easiest way to stop it would be - we're essentially, of course, at 0 degrees yaw and closing up to 90 degrees pitch, so it's just a question of stopping at 260 roll, roughly, and - How about for a procedure going MANUAL ATTITUDE, three to RATE COMMAND and then, seeing as how our deadband has already collapsed, I'll turn on the panel 8 RCS thrusters, at which time it should stop at whatever attitude it finds itself in. And if I do all of that as it comes up on 261 degrees roll, we should stop right there. Is that sufficient?
Sounds like it might save a little gas.
Houston, Apollo 11. What page do you want in that revision? Over.
Roger, 11. If you'll turn to page F2-20. Over.
Okay, Tim -
Roger, 11. Under column A on page F2-20, line 5, line 05, the new data is 01042; line 07, the new data is 00256. Skipping down to line 11, 00070; line 12 is 00042; line 13 is 77730. In column Bravo, lines 3, 4, and 5, which are blank, should be all zeros for line 3; line 4 is 20017; line 5 20616. Over.
Roger. Page F2-20, column Alfa: 05, 01042; 07, 00256; 11, I'll say again. 11, 00070; 12, 00042; 13, 77730. Column Bravo: 03, 00000; 04, 20017; 05, 20616. Over.
Roger. Good readback, Buzz. And stand by, Mike, on the coming-out-of-the-PTC recommendation. Over.
Okay. Fine.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston with a recommendation on exiting PTCM. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Mike. We'd like to see you go to ACCEL COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches. Then to turn on the AUTO RCS SELECT switches, and then go RATE COMMAND. That will prevent us from firing jets uncoupled. Over.
Okay. Fine. And I would guess go RATE COMMAND and roll first and then followed by pitch and yaw.
Okay. That sounds good if - And when you get to the roll attitude desired, just go RATE COMMAND at that time and it'll stop us right on.
Yes. I agree, Charlie. That sounds right.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston with some more words on exiting PTC. Over.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Roger. Mike, when you were playing with the P37 a while ago and we collapsed the deadband back down, the DAP assumed that the deadband was centered around the new attitude that we happened to be at, at that time. Since then, we've drifted out a couple of degrees in both pitch and yaw from that attitude such that if we did the procedure as we called it up to you of going ACCEL COMMAND, turning on all of the AUTO RCS SELECT switches and then RATE COMMAND, it would attempt to fly back to the pitch and yaw attitude that it had when the deadband collapsed. We can prevent that by - just immediately prior to going to RATE COMMAND on the MANUAL ATTITUDE switches, if you cycle the SPACECRAFT CONTROL switch to SCS, then back to CMC. Over.
Sounds like a winner.
Okay.
I'm not going to let these LM guys play with my DSKY anymore.
You sound like you'd better protect it. It looks like just about anything that you do with that DSKY is going to collapse that deadband back down.
Understand.
Charlie, we just STABED to 261 degrees roll, and it looks like whoever figured it out did a good Job. It's right there, dab-smack in the middle of window number 1.
Sounds great.
Looks like Houston's still got a little smog over it, Charlie.
We've got a constant overcast here in the room. We'll be right there. Stand by.
Of course, a little cloud from up here probably covers 8 or 10 states.
11, Houston. Some of our guys just came in from outside and said it's pretty clear over the center here. It's cleared up completely. All the storms have moved on.
Very good.
Oh, yes, Charlie. I can see it through the sextant now, and I can see the coastline is clear. Those clouds are just inland a few miles.
Okay. We copy.
Looks like the southeast part of the country is all socked in.
California looks nice. The San Joaquin Valley shows up as a real dark spot with a lighter brown on either side of it. You can't tell that it's green. It looks just sort of dark gray or maybe even real dark blue.
How does the Mojave look? Is it clear?
Yes. As usual.
Roger. The - around -
It looks like there's some clouds just to the west of the Sierras, northeast of Bakersfield a little bit; and crossing over into the Mojave from Bakersfield looks clear; and then as you get on further to the southeast of there, there's a few clouds.
Roger, 11. Can you pick out Edwards in the sextant? Over.
I can see a 104 taxiing out for takeoff on the runway.
Hey, man. That's super.
These dang bastards almost always have a 104 taxiing out for takeoff.
11, Houston. Could you pick out anything around Edwards, a dry lake or anything? Over.
Negative, Charlie. I just - I don't have that resolution. But to give you some idea, I can - on the lower Texas coast, I can see - knowing what I'm looking for, I can see Padre Island. I can just barely make out the fact that there's a thin spit of land and then there's a little dark zone which is the Laguna Madre between it and the mainland.
Roger, 11. That's pretty significant. Thank you much, Buzz.
Right.
How far out are we, Charlie?
Stand by. I'll give it to you exactly. Looks like around 130,000, but stand by.
Okay.
11, Houston. The exact range is 125,200 miles, and you're traveling 4486 feet per second.
Pretty far and pretty slow. Just past halfway.
Hey, Charlie, what the latest on Luna 15?
Say again, Buzz? Over.
Roger. What's the latest on Luna 15?
Stand by. I'll get the straight story for you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Charlie.
Roger. Latest on Luna 15 - TASS reported this morning that the spacecraft was placed in orbit close to the lunar surface, and everything seems to be functioning normally on the vehicle. Sir Bernard Lovell said the craft appears to be in an orbit of about 62 nautical miles. Over.
Okay. Thank you, Charlie.
And also, President Nixon has reported - or declared a day of participation on Monday for all federal employees to enable everybody to follow your activities on the surface. Many state and city governments and businesses throughout the country are also giving their employees the day off, so it looks like you're going to have a pretty large audience for the EVA.
Oh, that's very nice, Charlie. I'll tell Neil about it.
Houston, Apollo 11. We've stopped PTC. We're in the right position; we're setting up for TV.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. We have you stopped in the PTC; attitude looks good to us. Mike, I would like to get a COMM check. The last couple of the transmissions from the spacecraft has been garbled from especially Buzz. Could you both give me a COMM check? Over.
Roger, Charlie. Buzz here. How do you read? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Roger. You are about four-by with a slight decrease/increase in volume, sort of a wavy volume to it. Over.
Okay. I moved my mike around. How about now? Is this any better?
Hey, that's beautiful right there. Thank you.
Okay, Charlie. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How do you read me?
Roger. You're five-by. Is Neil on?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Roger, Neil. You're five-by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We got the network all configured for the TV. You can start any time you want. Over.
Okay, 11. We have a picture. We see the Earth right in the center of the screen. Over.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11 calling in from about 130,000 miles out. And we'll zoom our camera in slowly and get the most magnification we can. Over.
Roger.
11, Houston. The definition is pretty good on our monitor here. The color is not too ..., at least on this set. Could you describe what you're looking at? Over.
Roger. You're seeing Earth, as we see it, out our left-hand window, just a little more than a half Earth. We're looking at the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the north half of the top half of the screen, we can see North America, Alaska, United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America. South America becomes invisible just off beyond the terminator or inside the shadow. We can see the oceans with a definite blue cast, see white bands of major cloud formations across the Earth, and can see coastlines, pick out the western U.S., San Joaquin Valley, the Sierra mountain range, the peninsula of Baja California, and we can see some cloud formations over southeastern U.S. There's one definite mild storm southwest of Alaska, looks like about 500 to 1000 miles, and another very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the - or a long ways off of the equator, probably 45 degrees or more south latitude. Can pick out the browns in the landforms pretty well. Greens do not show up very well. Some greens showing along the northeastern - northwestern coast of the United States and northwestern coast of Canada.
Roger, 11. It's a pretty good picture on clarity here. We're having - can you tell us - It appears to us that there are two distinct cloud- formations trending east/west, one approximately about along the equator, and one around 30 or so south latitude. Could you tell us exactly where those cross the landmasses? Over.
Yes. They cross just south of the lower part of Mexico, probably through Central America. That is the equatorial band which we assume to be the intertropical convergence zone. The other band, which stands about 30 south, correctly appears to join the equator at the far left, or just beyond the horizon on the left edge of Earth, or at least it looks like it's going to join it. We don't have an explanation for that banding.
Roger, Neil. Thank you. It also appears that just to the left of the terminator, up in the northern hemisphere, there's a cloudband trending - a gap in the cloud, trending northwest/southeast. It appears to us that that comes in about over the northern United States, or perhaps the central United States. Is that about correct? Over.
I can see on the monitor the thing you were talking about, but right now I can't get my eye to the window to pick out just where it crosses the shoreline.
Roger.
You guys are doing a good job. It's a real steady picture, here. We're - Clarity is excellent. The color, it's - the clouds are - The whites are distinct. The rest if it looks like, to me anyway on the monitor I'm observing, is a fairly greenish blue is the way I'd describe it. Over.
It appears that the - -
Well, we can't observe much green from the spacecraft.
Roger. On this monitor, the landmasses appear to be just a darker grayish color rather than a brown.
Well, it's true that we do not have the depths of color at this range that we enjoyed at 50,000 miles out. However, the oceans still are a definite blue and the continents are generally brownish in cast, although it is true that they're tending more toward gray now than they were at the closer range.
Roger, 11. We've been - I've just been vectored to another monitor and sure enough, the browns are coming in a lot more distinctly on the Eidephor that we have up on our screen in the control center. Over.
Okay, world, hold on to your hat. I'm going to turn you upside-down.
11, that's a pretty good roll, there.
Oh, I'd say sloppy, Charlie. Let me try that one again.
You'll never beat out the thunderbird.
Apollo 11, Houston. That practice did you some good. It's looking - real smooth roll, there.
Oops! Spoke too soon.
I'm making myself seasick doing it, Charlie. I'll just put you back rightside-up where you belong.
Roger.
You don't get to do that every day.
11, Houston. Could you describe, from your view, the polar cloudcap? It appears to us to extend down the western coast of North America. Would you estimate how far it extends down? Over.
Trying to fit everybody into the window.
It appears that the cloudcap comes down a little bit below the southern extremity of Alaska.
Roger.
We've - 11, we've lost our picture here, now.
Okay. Apollo 11, Houston. We've got the picture back now.
Unfortunately, we only have one window that has a view of the Earth and it's filled up with the TV camera, so your view now is probably better than ours is.
Roger. We copy.
11, Houston. If you could comply, we'd like to see a little smiling faces up there, if you could give us some interior views. I'm sure everybody would like to see you. Over.
Okay. We'll reconfigure the TV for that.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. It appears to us that we're seeing a view from outside plus a little of the inside. It appears you've taken the camera away from the left window now. Over.
That's correct. We're moving it back and reconfiguring for interior lighting.
Roger.
We can still see the Earth through the left window, and it appears that we can see a floodlight off to the left, either that or some Sun shafting through the hatch window.
It's a floodlight.
Roger.
Now we're coming in. Can't quite make out who that ...
That's big Mike Collins, there - -
You got a little bit of - Yes, hello there sports fans. You got a little bit of me, plus Neil is in the center couch, and Buzz is doing the camera work at this time.
Roger. It's a little dark now, 11. Maybe a bigger f-stop might help.
Yes, that's in work.
It's getting a lot better now, 11. Mike, you're coming in five-by. I got a good -
I would have put on a coat and tie if I'd known about this ahead of time.
Is Buzz holding your cue cards for you. Over.
Cue cards have a no. We have no intertions of competing with the professionals, believe me. We are very comfortable up here, though. We do have a happy home. There's plenty of room for the three of us and I think we're all learning to find our favorite little corner to sit in. Zero g is very comfortable, but after a while you get to the point where you sort of get tired of rattling around and banging off the ceiling and the floor and the side, so you tend to find a little corner somewhere and put your knees up or something like that to wedge yourself in, and that seems more at home.
Roger. Looks like Neil is coming in five-by there, 11. Mike, see you in the background. The definition is really outstanding. The colors are good. It's a real good picture we're getting here of Commander Armstrong. We - Buzz, when you take the camera over towards the window where the Sun's shafting through, it tends to blank it out, though.
Yes, Neil's standing on his head again. He's trying to make me nervous.
Roger.
He's disappearing up into the tunnel, of course, as he would going into the lunar module, only backwards.
Roger. We 'can see portions of the LEB now. The systems test meter panel, in the lower part of the picture, or we did have it, anyway.
Okay. And directly behind his head are our optical instruments, the sextant and the telescope that we use to take sightings with.
Roger. Copy. And we see the DSKY flashing with a 651. In fact, we can read registers 1 and 2 quite clearly.
We have the old high gain angles telling us which way the Earth is.
Copy. That's a beautiful picture. Clarity is outstanding.
We can also give you the time of day in our system of mission elapsed time. Elapsed time: 34 hours 16 minutes and umpteen seconds. Can you see that clearly enough, Charlie?
Roger, Apollo 11. We can see it counting up every - every second. We got 34 17 02 now.
Okay. Back to the high-gain angles.
Roger.
Now we have amputated those.
11, Houston. We have a beautiful rainbow there now as you move the camera around. ... That looks like the star charts coming into view, now. Over.
Yes. Those are Buzz's two star charts that he is using right now as sun shades over the righthand window, window number 5.
Roger. We see the sun shining in through it behind him and plotting out the equatorial - correction, ecliptic plane, and the stars that you're using for the navigation.
Roger. He doesn't really need the charts. He's got them memorized. They're just for show.
We copy.
While we're pointing up in this direction, we see out our side windows the Sun going by and, of course, out one of our windows right now we've got the Earth. Now right behind my window, of course, we have the Sun, because the Sun is illuminating the star charts that we see. This line represents the ecliptic plane and these lines, vertical lines, represent our reference system that the spacecraft is using at this time. As we approach the Moon, the Moon will gradually grow larger and larger in size and eventually it will be in - it will be eclipsing the Sun as we go behind it, as we approach the lunar orbit insertion maneuver.
Roger, 11. We've - Could you attempt a little bit better focus there, 11? Over.
11, Houston. That's a lot better on the star chart now. We can make out the ecliptic plane and the planets and the Sun and the Moon as they have gone at various places throughout the ecliptic plane. Over.
Okay, Charlie.
If we can get some of the wires untangled here, we'll give you a demonstration of how easy pushups are up here.
11, Roger. Good view of Buzz, there.
When it gets pretty hard doing it that way, we just roll over and do it the other way.
Roger. We copy. We couldn't figure out whether that was a chinup or a pushup. Just take your choice, I guess.
Well, it looks like it's probably almost your dinner time down there, Earth. We'll show you our food cabinet here in a second.
11, Roger.
11, Houston. We see a box full of goodies there. Over.
We really have them, Charlie. We've got all kinds of good stuff. We've got coffee up here in the upper left and various breakfast items, bacon in little small bites, beverages like fruit drink, and over in the center part we have, oh, all kinds of things. Let me pull one out here and see what it is.
Roger.
Would you believe you're looking at chicken stew, here? All you have to do is - 3 ounces of hot water for 5 or 10 minutes. Now we get our hot water out of a little spigot up here with a filter on it that filters any gases that may be in the drinking water out, and we just stick the end of this little tube in the end of the spigot and pull the trigger three times for 3 ounces of hot water and then mush it up and slice the end off it and there you go, beautiful chicken stew.
Sounds delicious.
Yes. The food so far has been very good. We couldn't be happier with it.
Roger.
Could I borrow that flashlight a second?
The surgeons are saying thank you, there, for that.
And it is sort of down in a dark corner, so we have a flashlight here to help us see things; and if I can let go of it carefully, it'll just hold itself right where it is.
Roger.
As long as it's ..., it will.
Apollo 11, Houston. That's a pretty good demonstration. You started off really stable there, Mike. It's -
Well, the problem is, no matter how carefully you let go, you bump it just a tiny little bit and set it in motion, and once in motion there she goes. Try that again.
It looks fairly stable now with slow rotation.
Well, so much for the food department. I'm going to close up the store down here.
Roger. We copy.
Charlie, we checked out the cable lengths, and we're thinking we might want to see if we can take the TV into the LM with us tomorrow for part of the time. Over.
Roger. Good show. We'd like to see it if it'll reach that far. Over.
We'll give it a try.
Roger.
And where we sleep is down underneath this couch.
Houston. Roger.
Slowly sinking into the sack there.
It's really comfortable.
Forgot to give Buzz his flashlight back.
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give the folks a view of your patch on your CWG's? Over.
Stand by one, Charlie; we'll try and give you a closeup.
Roger.
11, Houston. We have the patch. Could you attempt to improve the focus slightly? Over.
11, Houston. The scan on the camera makes the - that's a little bit better now. The flashlight seems to flicker, due to the scan on the TV. We can't see the eagle. Now it's a little bit better. Over. Could you open the f-stop a little bit more? Over.
It's open all the way. We're going to have to move Buzz around a little bit.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. The color is better now. It's coming in. We could attempt a little bit better focus on it. There we go; it focuses a lot better now. We see the eagle coming right in on the lunar surface. Over. That's very good now.
Apollo 11, Houston. That's very good now. We can see the Earth in the background, Apollo 11, and the eagle coming in.
It's probably pretty hard to see the olive branch, isn't it?
Roger. It is.
Well, that's what he has in his talons, is an olive branch.
Copy.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're really impressed with the clarity and the detail that we have in the picture. The colors are - now, it's really an excellent picture now that I'm looking at it on our monitor, which is about 12 seconds before the networks can get it out due to the conversion that we have here on our TV converter. We're looking at the controls in the main display console. We can see the DSKY up on the panel. Over.
That would be nice if you could take a look at all the circuit breakers; make sure the right ones are in and the right ones are out.
Roger. Big Bubba's watching.
And we're glad of it.
Boy, you guys have sure been doing a good job of watching us, Charlie. We appreciate it.
The spacecraft's been beautiful, 11. We've really no complaints at all. Looks - Things are really great.
Can you see this DSKY on the MDC?
That's affirmative. It appears that - can't quite tell what program ... went P00. We see you punching in a VERB 35, I think it is. Over.
Yes. Might as well tell the EECOMM's - or tell the GNC and everybody to hold on to their hat and I'll push the EKTER button.
Roger.
Roger. We see a real display now.
That's a good demonstration of how the crew has the interface with the computer, talking to the programs and all that we have in the computer.
Well, that's right, Charlie. Sometimes it tells us things and sometimes we tell it things and mostly it talks to us.
11, Houston, We just lost our pic - I see we're going back outside now. Over.
...
11, Houston. We copy. Over.
Roger. We copy, and as we pan back out to the distance at which we see the Earth, well, it's Apollo 11 signing off.
Roger, Apollo 11. Thank you much for the show. It's a real good half hour. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Out.
Okay. That's it, Charlie.
11, Houston. We appreciate the show. Thank you very much. Over.
Right.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you key ERROR RESET on the DSKY, please? Over.
Okay. We should be straightened out now, Charlie, and back in P00.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do we stand on this O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge? You want to go ahead and do that as scheduled in the flight plan?
Stand by, 11. Over.
Okay.
11, Houston. You can commence the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge now if you'd like. Over.
Okay. Fine.
While Buzz is doing that, I'll change the lithium hydroxide.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger, Buzz. The attitude that we're in right now is a convenient one to start PTC in. We'd be satisfied with this attitude. So we'd like you to disable quads Charlie and Delta; and we'll wait about 5 to 10 minutes, and than we'll establish the PTC. Over.
Roger. Disable Charlie and Delta, and we'll wait before starting PTC.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. The rates are damped out well enough for you to initiate the PTC now. Over.
Okay. We'll get it going.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. This time the DAP didn't like 0.3. It's - We followed the procedures; we got down to 70 000 ENTER. It took off at about 0.7.
Roger. We're copying that. Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. Would you like high gain back?
Roger. And you - Would you select ATTITUDE HOLD? Over.
Houston. Would you say again what your request is?
Roger, 11. We'd like you to go back to ATTITUDE HOLD. Over.
Roger.
11, Houston. Looks like we're going to have to reinitialate - reinitialize this PTC.
All right.
Okay. Do you have any roll angle that you'd like to stop it in, Charlie? I haven't stopped it yet.
Stand by.
11, Houston. It's your preference. Right now if you want to. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger, 11. The problem on that initially - starting up the PTC was we failed to do the VERB 49 which - and load the desired initial attitude; so the DAP tried to take it back to the old attitude that we had started up in number of hours to go. That's why we picked up the rates in the other axes. We're going to wait in this attitude for about 20 minutes to dump out the rates again, and than we'll proceed with the VERB 49 and load our attitude that we have at the time - at this time. Over.
Okay. That sounds good, Charlie. When you get to the VERB 49, I'd like for you to give me the three gimbal angles that you want loaded.
Roger. We'll do. Over.
Thank you.
And Apollo 11, Houston. We have your flyby PAD if you're ready to copy. Over.
Stand by one.
Houston, Apollo 11. Is that P30 PAD?
That's affirmative. Over.
Okay. Ready to copy.
All right, Buzz. It's - flyby is the purpose. SPS/G&N: 62815, plus 097, minus 020 070 54 5944, minus 00028, plus 00023, plus 00069 029 149 312, apogee is NA, plus 00221 00078 001 00034, sextant star 01 2385 227, boresight star is NA NA NA. Latitude is minus 0265, minus 16500, 11899 36228, 144 56 47. In the comments: your set stars are Deneb and Vega, 007 144 068. No ullage. It's a docked burn using the PTC REFSMMAT. Stand by for your readback. Over.
Okay. Would you give me GET of O.05g again, please?
Roger. 144 56 47. Over.
Roger. Flyby SPS/G&N: 62815, plus 097, minus 020 070 54 5944, minus 00028, plus 00023, plus 00069, 269 149 312 NA, plus 00221 00078 001 00034, 01 2185 227 NA, minus 0265, minus 16500 11899 36228 144 56 47, Deneb and Vega, 007 144 068. No ullage; docked, PTC REFSMMAT. Over.
Roger. Say again your roll angle, Buzz. I copy - I read 029. Over.
Roger. 029.
Roger. Good readback.
Houston, Apollo 11. On the 0.7 rate, the rate loaded into the DAP is 0.1 or 0.2.
11, Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go.
Roger, Mike. Would you please copy down your VERB 16 NOUN 20 ICDU angles now, then execute a VERB 49 and load that - those angles, the NOUN 20 that you see on the DSKY into the VERB - into the NOUN 22 slot; and PRO on that, and that will start our 20-minute rate period. Over.
Okay, Charlie. I'll do that right now in just a matter of inches. Those numbers are plus 04511, plus 09021, and plus 35984. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. I've done that and, of course, I got an immediate 50 18. So I guess we're set up to proceed from here, and I'll start the 20-minute timer.
That's affirmative.
Houston. I still question that 0.7 rate with 0.2 loaded into the DAP, though. Could you explain that one?
Roger. We're working on it.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. We got a little laser visual experiment we'd like to - for you to do for us. If - if you got the Earth through any of your windows or through the telescope, would you so advise? Over.
Stand by one, Charlie.
At this roll attitude, what should our highgain angles be? Maybe that would help us locate you. We don't see you in the lens.
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Those high gain angles are pitch minus 70, yaw 90. We think the Earth is apparently pretty close to plus z-axis. Over.
Okay.
Okay, Charlie. I got you in the telescope.
Roger, Apollo 11. We've got a laser that we're going to - It's a blue-green laser that we're going to flash on and off at a frequency of on for a second, off for a second. It's coming out of McDonald Observatory near El Paso, which is - should be right on the terminator - or right inside the terminator. We are going to activate that momentarily. Would you please take a look through the telescope and see if you can see it. Over.
Telescope? Or sextant?
Either one. Over.
Okay, I'll try it with the telescope; and if I don't see it there, then I'll try the sextant.
Roger. We'll give you the word when they've got it turned on. Over.
Okay.
11, Houston. They don't have it turned on yet. We'll give you the word when they got it turned on. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We noticed the CRYO pressure dropped a moment ago. Did you stir up the CRYO's? Over.
Roger. We've finished our cycling operations.
Roger. Copy. Out.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. McDonald's got the laser turned on, Would you take a look? Over.
Okay, Charlie.
It's bluish-green.
11, Houston. We got some shaft and trunnion for you that might tweak it up a little bit. Shaft of 141.5, trunnion of 39.5. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. If you see it, it should be coming up - appear to be coming up, through the clouds. McDonald reports that there's a break in the clouds that they're beaming this thing through. Over.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can terminate the exercise on the Laser. Our rates are steady enough now for - to commence the PTC. Over.
Okays Houston. Neither Neil nor Mike can see it. Incidentally, those shafts and trunnions just missed pointing at the world.
Roger. Thank you.
As we are looking at it through the scanning telescope, it would be about a - oh, maybe a third of an Earth radii high and to the left.
Roger.
But, we did - but we did identify the El Paso area and it appeared to us to be a break in the clouds there, and we looked in that break and saw nothing.
Roger. Thank you much. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger. Go ahead. Over.
Were you following that on the DSKY?
Roger. Stand by.
11, Houston. What's your exact question? Over.
I've followed the procedure through step 7 down to the point where I've got 27303 ENTER, and this resulted in an OPERATOR ERROR LIGHT.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. Stand by a moment. We'll have an answer for you momentarily. Over.
Okay. Appreciate it, Charlie. Now the light's gone out without any further DSKY action.
Roger.
Correction. Stand by; that's not so.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. We've finally gotten concurrence on our problem here with 50 guys looking at it. When we were sitting in the 5018, we attempted to load the erasable before you terminated the VERB 49. So Mike, what we're going to have to do is call up the present CDU's, copy those down, and do a VERB 49, load the present, then do a PROCEED, then an ENTER, and then we can then set up ATTITUDE HOLD in step 6. Over.
Okay. I think that's what we did last time.
It appeared to us that we attempted to load the erasable prior to entering on the VERB 49 which VERB 49 was still running, and it clobbered the CDU's. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're moving at the proper rate.
Hallelujah!
11, Houston. It looks great to us now. Over.
It looks fine here, Charlie. The 0.7 part is the only part I don't find explained yet.
Roger, Mike. We're working on that one right now. We're coming up with the story soon. Over.
Thank you.
11, Houston. We're handing over COMM to Goldstone. Over. Correction, from Goldstone to Honeysuckle. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Houston through Honeysuckle. Ov - -
Apollo 11, Houston. Go ahead. Over.
You sound good to us through Honeysuckle. How do we sound?
Roger. You're five-by, Mike. We'd like the OMNI configuration as follows. OMNI Alfa place in Bravo, OMNI to OMNI, high-gain track to MANUAL, high-gain yaw 270, pitch - -
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. How do you read now? Over.
Roger. I'm reading you loud and clear. I'm not sure I got all those. I've got S-band OMNI B, OMNI, track to MANUAL, and beam wide, pitch - you'd better say that again, and yaw 270. Over.
Roger, Buzz. I broke up at pitch minus 50 at beam wide. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. Are you ready to copy some numbers on status report, et cetera.
Say again. Over.
Roger. Are you ready to copy some numbers on the status report, et cetera?
Roger. Go ahead. Over.
Okay. Radiation CDR 11005, CMP 10006, LMP 09007; medication negative. And I got some battery and RCS numbers for you.
Go ahead. Over.
Battery C 37.1, PYRO battery A and B both 37.1. RCS Alfa 82, Bravo 84, Cocoa 85, Delta 87. Over.
Roger, we copy. Radiation 11005, 10006, 09007; no medication; 37.1, 37.1, 37.1, 82, 84, 85, 87. Over.
That's affirmative. And you want a LM/CM DELTA-V? It's 1.1.
Roger. Copy 1.1.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Please verify that four CRYO heaters AUTO, the four fans off. Over.
Okay. We have been holding the O<sub>2</sub> heater number 1 in the OFF position. I believe that was your last instruction. All the other heaters are AUTO and all fans are off. Over.
Roger. Stand by.
11, Houston. We would like all heaters AUTO. Over.
Roger. All four AUTO, all four fans off.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. As the Sun sinks slowly in the west, the White Team bids you good night. If we get a story on the seven-tenths, we can give it to you in about 15 minutes or so; if not, we'll give it to you in the morning. Over.
Okay. That sounds fine, Charlie. Thanks.
Hey, you earned your pay today, Charlie. Thank you.
Roger. Good night all.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. One request: the optics switch to zero. And we've got a lot of theories on why it maneuvered at seven-tenths a moment ago, Mike, but no real definite answer. We'll be back with you later. Over.
Okay. No rush, Charlie. Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Roger. Mike, I think we can explain that seven-tenths rate. When we - the first time through, you know, we failed to go through the VERB 49, so we had a large error between our actual CDU and desired CDU in roll. And with that situation, the DAP - the vehicle will roll - will maneuver, rather, at a rate that is loaded in, which was three-tenths plus four-tenths rate, and it will limit at four-tenths above the desired rate, so - that is if we have a large enough angle between the desired and the actual, which we did. So, therefore, the rate was four tenths plus three tenths to give you the seven tenths. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Good morning, Houston. Apollo 11.
Good morning, Apollo 11.
... nice sleep. Be getting around to the ...
How's everything look up here from the ground?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Roger. Say again, please.
Roger. How do all our systems look?
Roger. They're looking great, and as far as we can tell everything is good from down here. Over.
Roger. Looks like the attitude held up real well during PTC last night.
Yes, it did. We were showing you remaining well within a circle of 10 degrees radius throughout the night. Seems to be working beautifully.
How's the old Green Team this morning? Did you have a quiet night?
Yes. It was a very quiet night. Down here the old Black Team is complaining they didn't get a chance to make any transmissions. Ron Evans is getting
Well, we'll be seeing them tomorrow, I guess.
Yes. Ron's getting to be known as the silent CAP COMM.
That's the best kind, Bruce.
(Laughter) Okay.
When you feel up to copying, 11, I've got a couple of small items in the way of a flight plan update and your morning consumables update. Over.
Apollo 11.
Roger, 11. We'd like to perform a waste-water dump at your convenience some time in the near future here. No particular time scheduled. Down air at the time for midcourse correction 3, which is about 53 55, we're deleting midcourse correction number 3 and all the items associated with it. For your information, the calculated value of the burn for midcourse number 3 was eight tenths of a foot per second, that is 0.8 feet per second. Canceling this, if we decide to burn midcourse correction 4, this would then give you a burn for midcourse correction 4 of 2.0 feet per second. At 53 hours we have an IMU realign P52. We're requesting that you do this while in PTC, and we plan to continue PTC throughout the day. Over.
- then we'll get to the waste-water dump - -
Say again, please. You're cutting out.
Roger. - -
11, this is Houston. Stand by a minute, please. We're having difficulty receiving you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Roger. Reading you the same. We did a minor reconfiguration down here. Stand by. Out.
Okay, 11. This is Houston. We switched your OMNI antennas as you rolled through the appropriate position. Did you copy the flight plan update item?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over
Apollo 11, go ahead.
Roger, 11. Did you copy the flight plan update items? Over.
Roger. How do you read me now, Bruce?
Okay. The battery charge is in the process now and the wastewater dump is in work. MCC 3 has been canceled. It would have been 0.8 feet per second. MCC 4 now looks like about 2.4 feet per second. At around 53 hours we'll do a P52 in PTC. Over.
Roger, 11. The magnitudes of the midcourse corrections were just for your information, but midcourse 4 was down around 2.0 feet per second. Again, for your information, on SPS chamber pressure, it looks like your onboard readout of 87 psi corresponds to 92 psi by our telemetry, and your value of 89 on board corresponds to 94. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Radio check on a new power amplifier in our transmitter. Over.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Roger. Loud and clear. Did you copy my notes on SPS chamber pressure?
Negative.
Okay. Just for your information again, it appears that your readout of 87 psi corresponds to our corrected TM readout of 92 - that's 92 psi, and 89 on board is really 94 psi. Over.
Roger, I got that you were reading about 5 psi low.
Roger. And are you ready for the consumables update?
Ready to copy.
Okay. Consumables update for GET of 46 plus 00: minus 5.5 percent, minus 6.5 percent, minus 2.5 percent, minus 7.5 percent, minus 5.0 percent, minus 2 pounds hydrogen, plus 1 pound oxygen, and that minus 5.5 percent on the RCS total corresponds to minus 66 pounds. Over.
Okay. I copy those, and I'll give you our percentages now: Alpha 82, Bravo 84, Cocoa 85, Delta 87. Over.
This is Houston. We copy your percentages, and do you have a crew status report on sleep For us?
Roger. And in descending order 8, 9, and 8. Over.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Houston, we're getting CRYO pressure warning now in the middle of stirring up the ...
Roger. We copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. We've got the continent of Africa ... facing toward us right now, and of course, everything's getting smaller and smaller as time goes on. The Mediterranean is completely clear. The Sun looks like it's about to set around Madagascar. The equatorial belt of Africa stands out quite clearly. We're seeing the dark green or a muddy colored green, compared to the sandier colors in the southern tip of Africa and, of course, the Sahara northern coast of Africa. There's a rather remarkable cloud that appears in the vicinity of the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. It's just about to go into the sunset now. It is casting quite a large shadow. It's isolated. There don't seem to be any other clouds ... the band of clouds near the tropical conversions clouds down around the equator clearly separate the clockwise and the counterclockwise cloud formations. Over.
Roger, 11. We copy your word description on that. I understand you can see a shadow being cast by that cloud over between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Any estimate on how long that shadow would be? Over.
It looks like it's a shadow. Coming around to - back that way - -
We're getting a lot of background noise now, also. If you will stand by a minute or so until we roll a little further in PTC, I think things will get better.
Okay. It's coming around to the number 1 window. We'll get you ...
Roger, we're hearing you.
11, this is Houston. The noise on the COMM seems to have quieted down now. I guess that we've rotated a new antenna into view and probably also the Earth out of view in your window. Over.
Okay. It looks as though the length of the shadow of that cloud is about the same as the width of the Persian Gulf.
Okay. We copy the width of the Persian Gulf, and I guess that all I can give you firsthand is a single isolated data point, and that is that it was clear here in Houston this morning. That's a pretty localized observation. As a result of your waste water dump, it looks like the PTC mode has been disturbed somewhat. We're showing you about 20 degrees out in pitch right now and about 6 degrees in yaw, which is significantly greater, about twice as much - a little more than twice as much as the deviation you had prior to the waste water dump. We' re watching it down here, though, and we'll let you know if we think any corrective action is required. Over.
Okay. Maybe we ought to - next time split that in half, and put half of it on one side and half on the other or something like that.
Yes. We could do that. We were actually pretty interested in seeing what the effect on PTC would be of the waste water dump. We don't recall ever having performed a waste water dump during PTC on previous missions. Over.
Well, now we know.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. I am looking at that cloud now around Pakistan through the sextant, and it appears to be one single cell in the latter stages of development. There is a smaller, more isolated one - -
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We lost you down in the noise on the COMM link here about the time you were describing the single cell cloud formation over Afghanistan-Pakistan area through the sextant. Over.
Roger. It came through a lot clearer through the sextant than with the monocular, and you could definitely tell it was one single cell in the latter stages of development. It must have gone up to over 50,000 feet, though. The eastern Mediterranean is phenomenally clear. You can see all the lakes; the Dead Sea stood out quite well. Over.
Roger. What appears to be the limit of resolution through that sextant from your current position? Over.
Well, I can't see it right now. It's outside the field of view.
Roger.
And, I don't know yow you'd really describe the limit of resolution. I will think about that a little.
Okay. I guess the smallest object that you could pick out looking through it would give us a pretty good hack.
Well, you can see the Nile River going almost up to its source. The lake is obscured by clouds, but you can trace it all the way on up.
Roger.
I guess that is down though, isn't it?
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We have been working under the assumption that it would take about an hour for the interference from a waste water dump to dissipate to the point where you could reasonably take star sightings for platform alignment navigation or something of this sort. If you have a spare minute or two, could you comment on the observation condition, now? Over.
Yes. Stand by one, Bruce.
Okay.
My guess would be the telescope's probably pretty useless, but you can differentiate in the sextant between water droplets and stars by the difference in their motions.
Okay, Mike. I guess that we've still got - what you are saying is that we've still got a lot of water droplets visible, but you can pick them out and distinguish them in the sextant, then.
Right. I think so. Buzz is looking through it now. Just a second.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. It looks like at this time the sextant would be quite usable for any alignment. There's actually very few ... verticals.
Roger, Buzz. How about the telescope? Is it useful now?
Well, it's not quite as useful; it never seems to be. Depending on the position of the Sun, it's got that band that seems to go across the center. I don't think it's because of the waste water particles that it would lack its effectiveness. Over.
Roger. What - Is this band something that's deposited on the outside of the optics? Over.
No. I see the reflection from the Sun.
Roger.
The Sun bounces off the LM structure. With the LM attached, that telescope is just about useless. Those star charts that MPAD provided us, I think, would be most useful if we had to use the - if for some reason we had to mark through the telescope. We could use those as a guide for what we're looking at and say, "Well, that bright blob over there has got to be that star because that's the position we're in." But so far, we've not been able to pick out any decent star patterns while docked with the LM using the telescope.
This is Houston. We copy.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead - -
- - How do your read? Over.
Roger. We're reading you loud and clear.
Roger. You're coming back a little scratchy. It,looks like our O<sub>2</sub> flow transducer's gotten a good bit worse. I just looked at it at the last water accumulator cycling, and it just barely registered - barely crept up above 0.2. Over.
Roger.
11, this is Houston. At the time of your cyclic accumulator stroking, we were on low-bit-rate data, and consequently not receiving the O<sub>2</sub> flow parameter. We expect that what you're seeing is probably nominal. That is, it's probably what we would expect from a transducer that's malfunctioning probably in this fashion, and it's just going to keep on getting worse like that. Nothing to worry about. We'll monitor things on the ground here. Over.
Okay. It does look like it's gradually degrading to about zilch.
Roger. We copy.
Apollo 11 CDR, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Roger, Houston. CDR. Loud and clear.
Roger. We're reading you the same. Out.
And would you check with FAO and see where that errata sheet is? We haven't been able to locate that.
Roger. I understand it's supposed to be the back page in Buzz's operational checklist.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Did you find it? Over.
Roger. We found it.
Roger. And I see you're in P00. If you can give us ACCEPT, we'll uplink a new state vector to you and update the CMC clock. Over.
Okay. You've got it.
Roger.
11, this is Houston. We're through with the uplink. You can go back to BLOCK.
Roger. Back to BLOCK.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We would like to terminate the charge on battery B at GET of 51 30. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We would like to terminate charging battery Bravo at 51 30 GET. Over.
Roger. Terminate charging battery Bravo 51 30.
Roger. Out.
11, this is Houston. We show you terminating battery B charge. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger, 11. We show you terminating battery B charge at about 51 hours 30 minutes. Over.
Okay.
Roger. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11. Would you like to have both oxygen and hydrogen purge on? Over.
11, this is Houston. Say again. Both what on? Over.
On the fuel cell purge: would you like to see both oxygen and hydrogen? Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Affirmative. We request hydrogen and an oxygen fuel cell purge. Over.
Okay. Any preference which first?
Negative. As long as you've got the H<sub>2</sub> purge line heaters on.
Okay. I'll go get - Go ahead with the hydrogen then.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. You copy my NOUN 93?
That's affirmative. We've got it.
Okay. I am going to go ahead and thrust then. Triangle difference is 0.01, but it's sort of difficult at three-tenths rate. I'm required to use medium speed unresolved, and it's difficult to hold the star centered long enough to get a decent mark on it.
Roger. We copy. It looks okay to us.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. I've got the morning news here if you're interested. Over.
Yes, we sure are. We're ready to copy and comment. Isn't that 2:30 there?
Roger.
Okay. Go.
Okay. Here we go. The interest in the Flight of Apollo 11 continues at a high level but a competing interest in the Houston area is the easing of watering rules. Mayor Louie Welch promises a lifting of lawn-watering restrictions if the rains continue. Friday is partly cloudy, and there is a 30-percent chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon. In Washington, D.C., the Senate Finance Committee approved extension of the income tax surtax, but a Senate vote on the bill - -
You cut out, Houston. You cut out.
Roger. Where do you hold me cutting out? Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read now? Over.
Loud and clear, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger.
Start after the rains in Houston.
Roger. In Washington, the Senate Finance Committee has approved extension of the income tax surtax, but a Senate vote on the bill currently seemed remote. In Austin, State Representative Ray Lemmon of Houston has been nominated as the National Director of the American Society for Oceanography. Lemmon has proposed a study of the possibility of establishing an institute of oceanography in Texas. This would be the first such institute on the western Gulf of Mexico. In Minneapolis, Minnesota, the weather bureau, after recapping today's weather showing a high of 88 and a low of 72, has noted "snowfall: none." From St. Petersburg, Florida, comes a radio report from the Norwegian explorer, Thor Heyerdahl, which said that the crew of his papyrus boat, the Ra, will sail into Bridgetown, Barbados, despite damage from heavy seas. The crew, however, will sleep on an escort vessel. Norman Baker, navigator of the expedition, said the crew was aboard the Ra today repairing damage from storms this past week, which split the footing of the mast. Part of the broken mast was jettisoned overboard, and the vessel was 725 miles east of the Barbados. "It is possible but uncomfortable to sleep aboard the Ra," Baker said in the radio report. "But the purpose of our voyage is not a test of strength or human endurance." That is the reason why the crew was spending nights aboard the escort vessel Shenandoah, which rendezvoused with the Ra on Tuesday.
In sports, the Houston Oilers are showing plenty of enthusiasm in their early preseason workouts at Kerrville, and Coach Wally Lemm says he is impressed with the fine group of rookies. National League baseball yesterday, Thursday: St. Louis 11, Philadelphia 3; Montreal 5, over Pittsburg 4; Atlanta 12, Cincinnati 2; San Fransciso 14, and Los Angeles 13. American League: we have Baltimore 3, over Cleveland 2; Detroit 4 to Washington's 3; Minnesota 8 to Chicago 5. Boston at New York was rained out. And in Corby, England, an Irishman, John Coyle has won the world's porridge eating championship by consuming 23 bowls of instant oatmeal in a 10-minute time limit from a field of 35 other competitors. Over.
Roger. I assume Houston didn't play yesterday.
That's correct.
I'd like to enter Aldrin in the oatmeal eating contest next time.
Is he pretty good at that?
He's doing his share up here.
Let's see. You all just finished a meal not long ago, too, didn't you?
I'm still eating.
Okay. Does that - that - -
He's on his - He's on his 19th bowl.
Roger. Are you having any difficulties with gas in the food bags like the 10 crew reported?
Well, that's intermittently affirmative, Bruce. We have these two hydrogen filters, which work fine as long as you don't hook them up to a food bag. But the entry way into the food bag has enough back pressure to cause the - the filters to start losing their efficiency. A couple of times, I've been tempted to go through that dryout procedure, but we found that simply by leaving the filters alone for a couple of hours, their efficiency seems to be restored.
Roger. We copy.
Their efficiency ranges anywhere from darn near perfect to terrible just depending on the individual characteristics of the food bags we're putting through them. Some of the food bags are so crimped near the entry-way that there's no way we can work them loose to prevent back pressure.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Hello, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, 11. As you've probably noticed, your coning angle in PTC mode is increased substantially as a result of the waste water dump, the fuel cell purge, and a natural coupling, so it looks like we are going to have to terminate PTC here in a little while. And we'd like to get your feeling as to whether you're still anticipating trying to send back TV signals from inside the LM; and if so, we'll try to provide an attitude that you can hold that'll give us high gain antenna lock on the Earth during the TV and LM activation period. Over.
Yes, we're still planning that activity if the cord lengths work out all right, and we'll accept those attitudes that you work up for us.
This is Houston. Roger. Out.
When you work up an attitude to get high gain, is there any way that we could get partial Sun in one of the two LM front windows?
This is Houston. We'll have a look at it.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We have a TV attitude for you if you're ready to copy.
Go ahead. Ready to copy.
Okay. We recommend stopping PTC at GET of 54 45 00, and this should put you at just about the right roll angle. The attitude we recommend is roll 263, pitch 090, yaw 000. This gives you the Earth out of window number 1 in the command module and places the high gain antenna in the CSM window for TV at your convenience. You will also have the Sun shining in - or shining at the hatch on the LM, and if you take down the window shades you should get some sunlight in. We're recommending wide deadband. Over.
Roger. Thank you, Houston. We'll look at that.
Roger. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11. When we pass the proper roll angle, we're not going to be anywhere near zero degrees yaw. Do you want us to just stop and try until we find ourselves in and then VERB 49 the three angles you gave us?
Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to stop at the proper roll angle, then do a VERB 49 to the roll and pitch. Over. Correction, roll and yaw.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger, 11. Do you read me? Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Stand by, Charlie. Yes, we're going to come out of PTC here at 263 roll and then do VERB 49 to the recommended attitude.
That sounds fine to us. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Before you open the pressure equalization valve, we'd like the LM/CM DELTA-P. Over.
Okay. Let me check it again. It was about 155.
Roger.
I read it 158 right now, Charlie.
Roger. Thank you much.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're stopping PTC at 263 ... 0.
11, Houston. You're about one-by on this transmission. Say again. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Do you read?
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on the high gain?
11, how do you read me? Over.
Read you loud and clear, Charlie. We just switched to HIGH GAIN, and we stopped PTC at roll 263, pitch 90, yaw 0. How do you read?
Roger, Mike. You're five-by now on the high gain. We're right between the OMNI antennas and pretty horrible COMM on the OMNI's. We got you five-by on the high gain, and we copy the PTC stoppage. Over.
Okay, fine.
Houston, we're going to open the DIRECT O<sub>2</sub> valve and start pumping up the cabin.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're going to hand over to Goldstone for uplink in about 2 minutes. We might have a momentary dropout of COMM. Over.
Alright. Can you hear our master alarm in the background? That's O<sub>2</sub> FLOW HIGH coming through this amplifier.
Roger. Copy.
That photoelectric cell is a good device. It's worked very well.
11, Houston. Say again. Over.
I say that photoelectric cell amplifier for the master alarm is a good device. It's working very well, and it's a nice pleasing tone.
Roger. Copy. Thank you.
Makes you almost glad to get master alarms.
Houston, Apollo 11. As a matter of curiosity, our O<sub>2</sub> flow meter is pegged FULL-SCALE HIGH.
Roger, 11. We copy that here. Over.
Okay.
Boy, that transducer's working somewhat.
Roger.
11, Houston. We'd like to try to attempt to correlate your O<sub>2</sub> flow in transducer with the flow valve that you've got open. How far - How far open would you say you have the REPRESS O<sub>2</sub>? Over. Correction, the DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>.
Stand by, Charlie.
Okay, Charlie. It's not open very far. It's hard to give you a good reading without shunting it again, but the arrow is at about the one o'clock position. Now I reduce the flow, and I'll let it stabilize here. Right now our onboard reading is about 0.4, and that's with the arrow in the O<sub>2</sub> valve at the two o'clock position. Would you rather have comparisons of O<sub>2</sub> flow readings or would you rather have valve position comparisons?
Roger. Stand by.
EECOMM's say they'd like to look at valve positions. Over.
Okay. Well, we're holding steady now at 0.3 pound per hour, and our cabin pressure is about 54; and I'll close the valve momentarily and then open it again to this position and tell you how much travel is required.
Roger.
It's about 30 degrees of travel, Charlie, from the closed position, which is with the arrow pointing at about three to three-thirty, four o'clock.
Roger.
Our flow is stabilized now at 0.6.
Roger. We copy. We're reading the same.
Okay.
Yes, open it back to the one o'clock position.
Roger.
Is that enough different positions, or you want more, Charlie?
Mike, that's good - good enough. We're satisfied now. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. We've terminated direct O<sub>2</sub>, our cabin pressure is 57, and, as a matter of curiosity, when we turn the DIRECT O<sub>2</sub> valve OFF, we get a master alarm just like they did in the spacecraft testing.
Roger.
11, Houston, we have a little update for you. When you go into the LM, we'd like you to unstow and bring back to the command module the following items. Over.
Ready to copy.
Roger. We'd like you to pick up the - out of the flight data file, the surface checklist, the mission rules NO-GO card, the DPS, APS, RCS limit cue card. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. The reason we wanted you to bring those three items back, we'll have some updates for you, for those three. Over.
Roger. We figured you would.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're getting the TV at Goldstone. We're not quite configured here at Houston for the transmission. We'll be up in a couple of minutes. Over.
Roger. This is just for free. This isn't what we had in mind.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. It's a pretty good show here. It looks like you almost got the probe out.
Yes, it's loose now.
Can you see that?
Roger, Neil. It's really good.
Not much light up in that area, but apparently the TV set's able to pick it up.
There are some bright spots shining on the probe. Apparently Sun shafting on it that just gets just about enough for us to make it out. Over.
I think those are the tunnel lights.
...
Oh, Okay. You're right.
Okay. It's loose now. Coming down.
Roger.
Looks like it's a little bit easier than doing that in the chamber.
You bet. This is the only way ...
You have to take it easy.
It's pretty massive, but it goes where you direct it.
11, Houston. That's a beautiful picture now, we've got. We're looking at a 12-second delay. To us you are just bringing it down by the optics now.
Mike must have done a smooth job in that docking. There isn't a dent or a mark on the probe.
Roger.
We're really getting a great picture here, 11. Over.
11, Houston. With a 12-foot cable, we estimate you should have about 5 to 6 feet excess when you get the camera into the LM. Over.
Roger.
We can see the probe now. Correction, the drogue.
Roger.
Okay. Drogue removal's coming next.
Roger. As we suspected.
11, Houston. Now it's a good view of the storage area under the couch.
11, Houston. Looks like you're pretty crowded in there with that drogue. Over.
Oh, it's not really bad.
This TV cable is getting in the way.
We see lots of arms.
The only problem, Charlie, is these TV stagehands don't know where they stand.
Well, you got to really have a union card, there. We can't really complain too much, I guess.
Apollo 11, Houston. Do you have a little white dot in the bottom of your monitor - TV monitor? Over.
Roger. We do.
Roger. I guess part of the camera's been burnt out down there. These are really beautiful pictures now, Buzz. Over. Real clear.
Okay. We might have got just a little bit of Sun in there. Is it just one small white dot?
That's affirmative.
We went up in the tunnel checking the roll angle, Charlie, and it's 2.05 degrees.
Roger. Copy. 2.05 on the roll CAL.
And that's a plus.
Roger. Plus.
11, Houston. The tunnel looks pretty clear to us. Somebody going up there now. Over.
It's Mike checking his connectors up there now.
Roger.
11, Houston. The lighting up in there looks very good to us at this time. Over.
I think that's mostly the camera. It - it's subdued to say the least.
Roger. It's pretty - It's gathering pretty well to us. We see everything quite clearly up in there.
Well, the docking latches look good today just like they did yesterday. Everything up in there looks just fine.
That sounds fine to us. Over.
11, Houston. We can even read the decals up there on the LM hatch.
Well, let me zoom it up and see how much you can read.
Okay.
We can see the LM umbilical connection quite well there, Buzz. We see you zooming in on one of the decals now. It's, "To reset, unlatch handle; latch behind grip and pull back two full strokes." That's about all we can make out.
Hey, you get an A-plus.
Thank you very much, sir. At least I passed my eye test.
I'm standing 6 feet from it, Charlie, and you can read it better than I can. There's something wrong with the system.
Roger.
That's a real good view of the LM hatch handle there, 11. Over.
Roger.
Looks like we'll be ready to go into the LM early if that's okay with you all down there.
Roger. It's fine with us, Neil. Go ahead anytime you wish. Over.
11, Houston. The white spot you see on your monitor, our TV people say it is a burn spot; but they expect it to dissipate after a couple of hours. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Okay, the dump valve is actuated.
Roger. Copy, 11. We see that very clearly. Is that you, Buzz, with your hand on it?
Yes.
Roger.
11, Houston. We're really amazed at the quality of the picture up in the tunnel. It's really superb. Over.
It is, considering the amount of light up in there.
Roger. We're about to open our hatch now.
Roger.
Roger. There's that same guy that, when you open up the door, why, he's waiting there for you, and he turns the lights on.
How about that. Just like the refrigerator.
Buzz, the view in through your - by your right - left shoulder there is so good we can see the ascent engine cover, the Velcro on it, and that's about all we can make out right now.
Now we can see the helmet stowage bag - -
We don't see anything loose up there.
Well, great. Looks good to us. We see the helmet storage bag.
Hello, 11. Houston. We got a view of the PLSS there, off the right of our screen.
11, Houston. Buzz, you already in? Over.
Roger. I'm halfway in, hanging out. Start turning around, I guess.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like you to read out the LCG reservoir sight level. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
11, we have a good view of the window there. It looks like the Sun's finally coming through the shade.
Yes, I'm afraid it's - We're just about plus Z toward the Sun.
That's affirmative. This attitude put both windows right toward the Sun - or the LM. Over.
Well, that may be good in some respects, but -
We had a view, Buzz, of the utility light cord. ...
Now let me show you a view looking the other way.
Roger. And we see right now the utility light or either the floodlight up there.
I think now I see the utility light still in the stowage bag. Hey, that's a great shot right there. We see you in there. Guess that's Neil and Mike. Better be, anyway.
We see you waving.
11, Houston. That's really a beautiful shot.
11, Houston. We didn't quite decipher that signal that just came from the CMP.
Just saying hello. On the LCG sight gage, you got about - oh, it looks like the white mark that's in the plunger is about a quarter to three-eighths inch out into the green away from the red. Is that what you'd like to see? Over.
Stand by. Roger, Buzz. That looks good to us. Thank you much.
It is the white index, is it not, that you're interested in comparing whether it's in the red or green?
Stand by. That's affirmative, Buzz. It looks good. That's a good reading for us. Over.
Okay.
We had a shot moment - a moment ago of the suit disconnect valve.
I'll open up the windows and see what the lighting condition's going to be like.
11, Houston. That's a real good view we have of the AOT. You're back now, Buzz, and notice you're taking down one of the window shades. Over.
The light is superb.
How's the Sun coming in? How's the Sun coming in from this direction going to affect what you can see?
It made it really super. The lighting is excellent in the - in the LM right now. We can make out the AOT, the ISA, and the left-hand window - there's a little glare off of that, but the LMP side the - with the shade down it's really excellent. Over.
Well, let's - I'm turned around, why I took the shade off my side first.
Roger. We copy. The light level for the TV is really excellent. Over.
Yes, the lighting in the LM is very nice now, just like completely daylight; and everything is visible. A good bit lighter than the tunnel was earlier.
Roger. We got a good view now, Neil, of the DEDA; and also Buzz's ACA.
Hey, I'm pointing it at the front hatch now. Everything seems to be in place down there.
Roger, we got the dump valves in view. Over.
Roger.
11, Houston. We see you removing the ISA now, folding it up, putting it up on the AOT. The instrument panels are coming into view behind.
Yes, I think it'd probably be best, since we've done SPS burn, to put it back over the instrument panel instead of putting it up over the PLSS on the recharge station. Would you care to comment on that one? We could do either just as easily.
Stand by. We'll have an answer for you momentarily.
11, Houston. That's really a super shot of the main display.
The vehicle is surprisingly free of any debris floating around. It's very clean.
Roger.
11, Houston. It's pretty hard to describe this view. It's really - really great.
Now you know how we feel.
Okay. Neil's OPS is about 57, 5800.
Copy.
And mine's about 5800, also.
Copy.
11, Houston. That's a good shot of Neil's PLSS, there. Over.
No, that's mine.
11, Houston. That moment - a moment ago, we had a good shot of your PLSS, Buzz, and the two helmet stowage bags. Down behind your left shoulder, Buzz, we have the - the DSKY and the ACA.
We're going to go ahead and take all the Moon data on back into the command module, Charlie.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, it appears that you're intending to put on the Sun filter and view the Sun through the AOT. Over.
Yes, unfortunately it looks like it's down a little bit more towards ... than I can be able to see in the AOT.
Roger.
We got a beautiful view of the side of the command module out of the AOT looking in the left rear detent.
Roger.
I can see the hatch and all the - all the EVA handrails. First time we've seen the silvery outside of the command module.
I can read the letters on the hatch cover. It's a boost cover release; and the big yellow arrow that points toward the opening - place where the tool B goes.
Roger. Great shot now back down into the -
And left on the - -
Go ahead, Buzz. Over.
Say again.
I was just saying we got a great shot looking back into the command module.
...
Okay. And the left detent, I can see the AO - or the rendezvous radar, and I move to the forward detent and that's about all I've got. I'm looking eyeball to eyeball.
Roger.
Charlie, is there any concern about the duration that we ought to have the window shades open?
Stand by.
We don't have - We don't have any circulation in here, and it might get a little on the warm side.
Roger.
We'll - We'll put up a couple of hoses in the command module here and get a little circulation going.
Sounds like a good idea. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. As far as the window shades go in this LM, there's nothing except for crew comfort. I don't think we've got any systems problem. Be sure to put them back up when you egress. Over.
That we will do.
Charlie, I'll give you a view out of the overhead window, back looking at the command module right-hand rendezvous window.
Roger.
Well, we see it now. Thanks a lot, Buzz. That's a good view through the overhead.
One washer on -
One washer's on by the overhead.
Roger.
There we go. We got it now.
There wasn't very much debris in the command module or the LM. We found very few loose particles of bolts, nuts, and screws and lint and things. Very few in each spacecraft. They were very clean.
Roger. Sounds good.
11, Houston. We have a good view out of the rendezvous - correction, the overhead window of the LM. We don't see anybody staring back at us, though. Over.
Charlie, can you see Mike's two eyeballs staring out through the rendezvous window?
11, Houston. Stand by. We haven't picked him up yet.
You are looking through a lot of layers of glass.
11, Houston. We had a - -
... on my monitor.
We had a slight glimpse of Mike in the rendezvous window at that time. It's pretty murky looking into there, though.
Okay. Here he is; I've got him. I've got, him on the monitor now.
Okay. We see him staring back at us now. Hello, in there.
Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendation for the ISA is to stow it back over the instrument panel. Over.
Roger. Will do.
11, Houston. We can make out the markings on the panel. We read SYSTEM A ASCENT FUEL, ASCENT OXIDIZER. Quad 1, quad 4. The - It's really unbelievable, the definition we're getting down here off that little camera. Over.
We can even see the barber pole on the talkbacks.
We can read the markings on the instruments for the glycol pressure, quantity, PCO<sub>2</sub>. You can even read the scale on the eight ball. Over.
11, Houston. We see the cross-feed barber pole, and we have the Velcro patches back up to the RCS systems now. We can see the markings on the meters, green and red bands, in limits.
We see you raised the cover on the abort stage. We don't recommend that.
Yes. We're going to tape that one over.
Roger.
We're going to tape that one over.
We concur.
The restraints in here do a pretty good job of pulling my pants down.
Roger. We haven't quite got that before the 50,000,000 TV audience, yet.
11, Houston. That's a good view of the eight ball. We see - You can even read the OFF flag, there.
You can see the signal strength meter for the radar, read the numbers on it.
Houston, did you want us to test the cameras in the LM and - I was wondering about that. I saw it in the flight plan, but I'm just wondering if you want to do that on CSM power, or do you want us to take both of the 16mm cameras back in the CSM and test them there? Over.
Stand by, Buzz.
As an alternative to that, why, we could wait LOI day and do it then when we transfer over to LM power.
Roger. Stand by. We'll have an answer.
11, Houston. On that TV, our commentary - The monitor I was looking at was delayed about 12 seconds, 12 to 15 seconds while it went through our color converter. It was probably - You thought I was crazy, but we were looking at it 15 seconds after you broadcast it. 11, Houston - -
We understood that, Charlie.
Okay. On the LM cameras, we'd like you to do it on LOI day with the LM power. Over.
Okay. That's what we'll do.
Houston, we're showing you something that came out of the Commander's checklist stowage packet. It's got a 16-millimeter camera in it, and it's got this little cylinder; and I guess - I don't understand what it is. Maybe you can tell us.
Roger. Stand by. We can't figure it out either.
It's got an arrow on the back, and it says "turn," but I'm afraid to turn it.
11, your friendly geologist says it's the camera cank- crank, excuse me, for the 16-sequence camera if it jams. Over.
All very well. Thank you.
There's that word again. The ancillary stowage container.
Roger.
The shades couldn't quite hack it, there, Buzz. Over.
Houston, 11. Are you still getting high bit rate off the OMNI's at this distance?
Stand by, Mike.
Apollo 11, Houston. About 50 percent of the time, we're getting high bit rate off the OMNI's when you're in PTC. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Apollo 11, Houston. Neil, at this attitude you look like you're about 12 feet long.
It seems like I always find myself upside-down in whatever I'm doing around here.
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give us a few comments on your crew comfort with the CSM hoses moving the air around? Over.
Well, it's picking up a little bit on circulation in here.
What do you estimate the temperature is, Buzz? Over.
Oh, I'd say maybe 73, 75.
Roger.
It's hard to tell at this density and pressure of gas, but comfort level is about the - about the same as the command module.
You probably - -
It was a little warmer or stuffier when we first got in, but it seems to be improving.
Houston copies. Out.
11, Houston.
You may be able to see some - -
Go ahead.
- - some particles jumping around on your screen. That's just dust particles that are being illuminated by Sun shafting in the window.
Roger. They're very clear now. Over. And that's a good view of Neil's - correction, of Buzz's circuit breaker panel, there.
I can just barely see the handrail on the front porch from the position on the right-hand window.
Roger.
11, Houston. Our view of the Panel 11 is - gets brighter, then darker. Are you changing the f-stop at all? Over.
No, what's happening is, we get pretty close to the window now and then, and it drives the automatic light control into the stop, I think.
I think that's right.
Yes, I had the switch on OUTSIDE while I was going through the overhead window. That may be what's contributing to some of it.
Roger.
11, Houston. We seem to be picking up a few more dust particles now. We see them quite clearly in the screen now. Over.
Yes, I'm choking on one every so often.
11, Houston. Your show is going out to the U.S. now. We're about to get the satellite up. It'll be transmitted to some other countries after that. Over.
Roger. I'm checking out this window bracket where I'll be putting it for the EVA pictures of Neil going down the ladder.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. We keep marveling about the color and the clarity of the picture. It's really difficult to describe. It's - It's just perfect. Over.
And, 11, it doesn't look like you're having too much trouble with that bracket up there, Buzz.
I'll tell you, those new knobs really make it easy to twist the thing and get it cinched down quite tight.
Roger.
11, Houston. Buzz, how does the alignment look, there?
It looks pretty good, as well as I can tell without the gear extended. I can't get a real definitive answer, but you couldn't fix it any place to see much more out of the window without hand-holding it for the whole time.
Roger. Looks like to us it's going to work real well.
Give it enough room to - Yes, I think so.
Buzz, we see you putting your window guard in place there, and back up to the ISA now.
Houston, ask FAO if the 90-degree bracket isn't stowed in the Commander's stowage assembly.
Stand by.
11, Houston. Buzz, you still looking for that 90-degree bracket? Over.
Yes, he is looking for it now.
Roger. We'll have a word for you in just a moment.
Our monitor shows pretty good, clear pictures from this angle. I already found the 90-degree bracket.
Roger, Neil. It's really a super picture. We've got the ACA, your ACA, the picture of the throttle, the 90-degree bracket. We see your handles, and now over to the bracket.
That's about the position we'll be putting the camera in after the initial descent on the ladder, and it'll be taken 1 frame a second for most of the EVA.
Houston copies. Out. That's a real good view of that camera.
Our monitor is a little bit wavy, so it's hard for us to tell when we're - when we've got a steady picture for you.
11, we have no complaints at all. We don't see that waviness on our picture. It's just really great. Over.
Do the edges of the window look like straight lines to you?
That's affirmative.
Okay. They don't in our monitor, and that leads us to make some corrections to the camera, which probably aren't required sometimes.
Buzz, we have no complaints at all. It's a magnificent picture.
What was that, Buzz, you're chasing now?
That was - That was me picking up some particles of paint that were floating through the air in front of the camera, there.
Roger, Neil. We got it. It appears to us that Neil's about to check the Velcro mat, there.
Okay, Buzz. We see the card up now.
Okay. For those of you that don't know, this is where we log most of our data for each of the LM maneuvers, and we have another card like this that the timeline book that is laid down on the table in front of the data display keyboard; and it's on this timeline that we have all our procedures. But we obviously have to hold these in place in zero g, so we make use of the Velcro patches on the back and on the table so we can attach these down here; and then we just turn the pages over when we go to new sequences in our timeline of procedures.
Roger.
And we're ready to copy DOI PAD.
Roger. We'll have the FIDO's work that one up for you momentarily.
11, Houston. That was a good shot of Panel 2. Now we got Panel 3 in view with the TEMP MONITOR switch. The stabilization - station and control panel, we see now, with the MODE CONTROL switches. Now over to the rendezvous radar. Real good.
11, that's real good camera work.
That'll be the most unusual position a cameraman's ever had, hanging by his toes from a tunnel and taking the picture upside-down.
Roger. Well you're doing a super job. We got a good view of the cross pointer, there. Had a good view of the tape meter.
We're giving you a picture now of the floor of the cabin. I think you can see the - one of the two portable life support system backpacks here in the center, and on each side, we have the two helmet visors. I'll remove one of them and show you a little closer view of what this looks like.
Roger.
Inside the helmet visors are the EVA gloves with the blue tips. I'm about to take those out now.
Roger, Buzz. That's a great shot now that we're getting of the helmet, the EVA visor, and also the - the EVA gloves in the background.
Okay. You did say this was going out now, didn't you?
Standby. I think so.
11, you got a pretty big audience. It's live in the U.S. It's going live to Japan, western Europe, and much of South America. Everybody reports very good color. Appreciate the great show.
Roger. Understand. Thank you.
Buzz, that was a good demonstration of your EVA visor assembly. Appreciate it.
Hey, I like the good view of Mr. Collins down there. We finally see him again.
Hello there, earthling.
Hello there.
11, Houston. We noticed when you were scanning over Panel 2 a moment ago, 1 and 2, the two eight balls were slightly in disagreement. Control said he'd like a AGS align, there.
Yes. One of them's AGS, one of them's PNGCS. The problem is, we don't know whether to align AGS to PNGCS or PNGCS to AGS.
Stand by.
11, Chris said he can tell you.
We'll cage them both.
Roger.
Like old home week, Charlie, to get back in the LM again.
Roger. I can imagine.
The traverse from the bottom of the LM to the aft bulkhead of the command module must be about 16, 20 feet. It's not a disorienting one at all, but it's most interesting to contemplate just pushing off from one and bounding on into the other vehicle all the way through the tunnel.
Roger. Must be some experience. Is Collins going to go in and look around?
We're willing to let him go but he hasn't come up with the price of the ticket yet.
Roger. I'd advise him to keep his hands off the switches.
If I can get him to keep his hands off my DSKY, it'd be a fair swap.
Roger.
That's why I've been eating so much today. I haven't had anything to do. He won't let me touch it any more.
Roger.
11, Houston. If that's not the Earth, we're in trouble.
That's the Earth, and we have a very good view of it today. There are a few more cloud bands on than yesterday when we beamed down to you, but it's a beautiful sight.
We have some horizontal banding in our TV monitor. Are we transmitting that to you, or do you have a clear picture?
Neil, we have a very clear picture. The only thing that we see is a little white dot in the bottom of our screen, which is - our TV guys say is an - apparently a burned out spot in the camera, but it should come back. Over.
Roger. We have that in our monitor also.
11, Houston. We do have three lines across our TV. I thought it was just a transmission problem, but everybody's telling me now that it's probably - it's on the downlink. Over.
No, those are the same three ones that we have.
Okay.
How far are - out are we now, Charlie?
Stand by. Give you exact figure.
Did you notice the difference between yesterday and today? This is as large an image we can - we can give you.
Roger. If you think we're smaller, you're now 177,000 miles out. Over.
Thank you.
That's nautical miles?
That's affirmative, 11. We -
... Hold on.
Go ahead. Over.
11, Houston. We see the - still see the banding along the intratropical convergence. I guess the most predominate one now is around the - up in the - around the equator or slightly north of the equator.
Yes, that's the way it looks, Charlie. Same as yesterday.
Roger.
Just keep the Pacific Ocean nice and clear and calm on splash day, is all we ask.
And Charlie, I'd like to say hello to all my fellow scouts and scouters at Farragut State Park in Idaho having a National Jamboree there this week; and Apollo 11 would like to send them best wishes.
Thank you, Apollo 11. I'm sure that, if they didn't hear that, they'll get the word through the news, surely appreciate that.
11, Houston. We have you - your subspacecraft point is just off the western coast of South America directly south of about Mexico City. Over.
That - That looks like what we observe from here.
And we're going to turn our TV monitor off now for a short bit while we have some other work to do. Apollo 11 signing off.
Roger, 11. Thank you very much. That was one of the greatest shows we've ever seen. We sure appreciate it. Over.
It was a pleasure.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Could you give us an idea of about how long it will be before you start close - closing the LM back up? Over.
We've got a little more work to do up here, Charlie. We're going to make sure that we have everything transferred around and stowed the way we want it and try to get a little bit ahead on tomorrow's timeline. I suppose that we could be out of there in another half hour or so if it was necessary.
Roger, Neil. We're not trying to push you. We're just trying to get an idea of - about water dumps and starting up the PTC again. Take your sweet time. Over.
Okay. We'd like to get a flight plan update from you for the next couple of hours, here. When you think what the various constraints might be and what - what order you might like us to do things.
Roger. Stand by. We'll have that to you in a moment.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, we'd like to go ahead and do a waste-water dump. We'd like you to dump it all the way down to zero. Over.
Roger. We copy that, Charlie.
How does that work, Charlie?
Houston, 11.
11, Houston. Did you call? Over.
Roger. Just noticed that the mast that the EVA light is on is charred brown. It looks as though it took quite a beating during launch.
Roger.
The EVA light still does work.
Roger. We'll let this - the SPAN guys look at this, and we'll be back with you with what we think. Over.
Okay.
11, Houston. We were wondering, Neil, with your closing comment on the TV, if you were going to turn it off. It indicated that you might be considering turning it back on. We were wondering whether we want to keep the lines up. Over.
Well, we want your recommendation on that, but I think we would just as soon, ourselves, terminate the TV. But if you have a commitment to keep, we'd be more than willing to turn it back on.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to terminate the TV. We don't - We think we got a really - a good tape. That hour and a half show was superb. And we'd like to pick up TV - correction - PTC at about 58 hours. Over.
Roger. PTC at 58 hours.
And we'll have the remaining functions in the flight plan soon. Over.
Okay. Fine.
Apollo 11, Houston. Our recommendations on the activities for the next hour or so, as far as flight plan goes, are: Continue your LM familiarization as desired until about 58 hours, then ingress to the CSM, close the hatch, and establish PTC shortly thereafter. Over.
And, Apollo 11, Houston. Terminate the - -
Okay.
- - the water dump. Over.
Okay, Charlie. Thank you.
Okay. Water dump being terminated now.
Houston, Apollo 11.
11, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Houston. I'd like to do a P52 option 3 and tweak the platform up prior to starting the PTC. Over.
Roger, 11. Stand by.
11, Houston. That sounds like a good idea to us. Go ahead.
Okay. And the platform's looking pretty good to me. It looks like the worst axis drift is 0.01 something degrees per hour. Is that about what you figure?
11, Roger. We've had reports all the marks have been good all the - the last couple of times you've run them. Just a moment; I'll get you some information on the apparent drift rate.
Okay, Owen. Thank you. You got the maroons on?
Say again, 11.
I say you got the maroons on now?
Not permanently, Mike. Just have a stand-by here while Charlie's out checking how to use that special tool on the camera. The maroon team will be on tomorrow.
Okay. Nice to hear your voice. How's everything going?
Everything's going smoothly here. We sure enjoyed the show this afternoon, Mike.
Okay.
11, Houston. We suggest you go ahead and do the P52 first, and we'll take a look at the angles and give you some new drift rates after taking a look at them. Over.
All right. Fair enough.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead. 11, here.
11, Houston. A little information to you there, CDR. We've all taken a momentary brief respite from out work here to have some special - to have a bite of special moon cheese that is - I understand it's been sent to us directly from Wapakoneta, your own hometown. Over.
No, we can't - we can't pronounce it either. I think you'll enjoy that. They make a fine brand of cheese.
Roger, there, and I'll polish up the grammar for the next trip.
Houston, 11. You are looking at the NOUN 93, and I'll proceed when you copy them.
11, Houston. We've got them.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like P00 and ACCEPT. We have a DELTA-H update for you. Over.
All right, Charlie. Stand by one.
Houston, Apollo 11. P00 and ACCEPT.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. We got the load in. The computer's yours. Over.
Houston, 11. Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like for you to stir up the CRYO's now. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're completed in the LM. We're closing up the hatches and the probe and drogue back in.
Roger. We copy. Out.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by to watch your startup on the PTC at any time. You can start off at the VERB 49. Over.
Wilco. We're just finishing up the probe and about to close up the hatch here. We're going to be a couple of minutes late, probably, getting started in the PTC.
Roger. No sweat, 11. We're standing by. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, there's no wait required. Where rates are steady, you can proceed on. Over.
I'm doing it, Charlie.
Roger.
The tunnel's all taken care of, the drogue, probe, and hatch all back.
Roger. Copy. Out.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have some new additions to your alternate contingency checklist if you would break that out. Over.
Stand by.
Okay, Houston. 11's ready to copy.
Roger, 11. If you'll turn to page F2-22. Over
Okay. I have F2-22.
Roger, Neil. Under column 1 - that's column Lima, line 06. The new data is 00001. Line 07, the new data is 02134. Over.
Okay. I have in F2-22, column Lima, item 6, 00001; item 7, 02134.
Roger. That's correct. Thank you much. Out.
11, Houston. For your information, those two entries are an update to your DELTA-H that we have already uplinked into the CMC. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
What was I marking on, Charlie? About an 18-kilometer line, or what?
We - Our update puts you to - the DELTA-H to 35 kilometers, Mike. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've got some switch positions for you for the high gain. Over.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger, Buzz. Select Bravo, OMNI, HIGH-GAIN TRACK to MANUAL; BEAM, WIDE. Over.
Okay. Bravo, OMNI; TRACK, MANUAL; and BEAM, WIDE.
Roger. And your high-gain angles are minus 50 on the pitch, 270 on the yaw. Over.
Okay. Going there now.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have some updates and some things we'd like to talk to you about, if you aren't in the middle of your meal. If it's convenient anytime for you, we're ready with some updates. Over.
What - What are the updates going to apply to?
Roger. We have a couple of changes on the LM mission rules NO GO for your NO GO card, Neil. One slight change on the APS/DPS fuel and TEMP pressure card, and we have a change to the procedure for the secondary radiator leak check, which is to be formed at - performed at 71 hours tomorrow, and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed in the wrong place. Over.
Okay. Is any of those in the flight plan? The secondary radiator, for example?
That's affirmative. The secondary radiator leak check is called out in the flight plan at 71 20. That procedure is listed in your launch operations book on page 2 9, L2 9. We'd like to change that procedure. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
Charlie, on the secondary leak check, just read it verbatim like you want, and I'll copy directly into the flight plan and not fool around with the checklist.
Roger. That's fine. If you're ready to copy, stand by.
Ready to copy on the leak check.
Roger. It's monitor secondary accumulator quantity. Step 2 is secondary glycol to radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity - Are you with me?
Yes, I'm with you.
Okay. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, AC 1 or AC 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol discharge secondary pressure 39 to 51 psig. Also verify secondary EVAP out TEMP has changed. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol to radiator valve, BYPASS. That ends the procedure. Over.
Okay. I read back: monitor secondary accumulator quantity; secondary glycol radiator valve, NORMAL for 30 seconds, then to BYPASS. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity, secondary glycol to radiator valve to NORMAL. Secondary coolant loop pump, AC 1 or 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol secondary discharge pressure 39 to 51 psig. Verify secondary evaporator outlet TEMP has changed. Secondary coolant loop pump, OFF. Secondary glycol radiator valve to BYPASS. And what's the reason for the change, Charlie?
Roger. Stan is concerned that our present procedure as shown in the checklist does not really flow glycol through the radiator, and it - They want to verify that we do not have a plugged secondary radiator. Over.
Okay. They have any abnormal indications in that system, so far?
Negative. This is the procedure that they came up with. It's just a check, Mike. Everything's looking great to us. Over.
Okay. Fine.
Charlie, we'll get back with you on these other changes in a few minutes. Okay?
Roger, Neil. No hurry. Over.
11, Houston. We're wondering who's on horn.
Say again, Houston?
We just had a little music there.
We'll keep you entertained.
Roger. That was good. You can keep it coming down, 11.
Okay.
Because it's a special occasion today, Houston. This is the third anniversary of Gemini 10.
Roger. Happy anniversary.
Thank you, sir.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy your update.
Roger. Stand by.
Okay, Buzz. The first item is that we have indications that your landing site obliques are not in the proper position. If you'll check, we think that the intermediate scale landing site oblique is stowed in the CSM lunar landmark book. We think that the large scale landing site oblique is stowed in the back of the LM lunar surface map book. Over.
I think I heard you Charlie, but I'm not sure that I understand.
Roger. According to our stowage list the - the landing site oblique should be in the transfer bag. In - But in the backup set of data, the intermediate scale oblique is in the CSM lunar landmark book, and the large scale oblique is in the back of the LM lunar surface map book; and that's the reason we think that they might be not where you think they are. Over.
Okay. We've got three obliques. The last one is one I asked for recently. It's just a blow up of the second one. The first one is one that's got dotted lines on it, indicating horizon view and 50-degree LPD; and all three of those are in the transfer book. Over.
Roger. Fine. We were wrong in our - in our backup set. We had those out of place. Looks like the onboard data's good. We just wanted to let you check on that one. We have an update on the APS/DPS fuel card that you place on the panel. It's a typo error. If you'll break out that little card, we've got the - correct that typo error. Over.
Stand by.
Okay. I got it.
Roger, Buzz. Under the DPS column on the pressure side, you go down to the fourth item, says pressure greater than 150 PTCA should be greater than 65 percent. Over.
Okay. That's greater than 1.8 but less than 65 and greater than 150 for greater than 65.
That's affirmative. Out.
And we have three items on the mission rules NO-GO card, if you're ready to copy those. Over.
Okay. I've got the mission rules NO-GO.
Roger, Buzz. First entry's on the EPS under AC bus A. The line extends all the way to high gate. Actually, the line should read - at DOI it would be NO-GO AC bus A. After that the NO-GO would be both buses. So if you will just pencil in both buses from PDI through high gate, it'll be correct for that line. Over.
Okay. I've got that: AC bus A for DOI and both buses NO-GO for PDI on.
That's affirmative up until high gate. You can stop at the line in front of the column "5 minutes to low gate". Now the next line is under the G&C PGNS, pitch and roll GDA's. You can scratch that line completely. Over.
Roger. Got it.
Okay, Buzz. Last entry is down under RCS, and it's a typo error under the three - in the line "three axis attitude control". If you proceed to the right at PDI plus 05, you'll see one axis. The line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. That's incorrect. The line should stop under "5 minutes to low gate". Over.
Okay. We're stopping that at "5 minutes to low gate".
That's affirmative. That completes that card. The rest of the updates are just really for your information based on our 58 hour platform - look at the platform. We are really good shape. Your GYRO's have almost no drift in them since - plotted update we were looking at X of a minus 2.24 ... Y of point plus 0.87, Z of minus 0.11. Since the update, which was based on the 52 hour P52, I believe, we gave you an X drift of plus 0.79, yaw of plus 1.06, Z of plus 0.02 ... I can see the difference between the 52 hour and the 57 hour alignments were - did not really give us enough time to get a real good or completely valid update on the drift check. So we're real satisfied with the way the GYRO's are looking. The PIPA's are looking great also. We are in real good shape with those, too. Over.
This is Apollo 11. Radio check.
Roger. Reading you five by. How me? Over.
Okay. Loud and clear. You cut out when you were talking about the platform - something about 52 hours and after that, we never heard you again.
Roger. Guess we were changing antennas. Stand by. That's affirmative, 11. We were swapping antennas on you down here. Basically the word is that we have a real good platform, very small drift on the GYRO's, and very small drift in the PIPA's. Over.
Roger. Thank you. And I would like to have a few words of clarification if you will give them to me on the RCS ... what that change of pitch may mean.
Copy. A few words of clarification on the RCS? Oh. Roger. The update there, Neil, you are speaking of about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate?
Yes. That's right. I'm not quite sure what that ... means beyond 5 minutes.
Stand by. I'll make sure I got my story straight with Control. Stand by.
Okay.
11, Houston. On the RCS, what we are saying is that if we lose control about one axis prior to low gate, we would recommend an abort. This would require a - a loss of - of two distinct jets which is not very probable, but that is what we are recommending. After low gate we would continue on. We would recommend that we continue on to attempt a landing. Over.
Roger. I think I ...
Roger.
Charlie, did you say you had some updates for me from the lunar surface book?
Apollo 11, say again. You were cut out. Over.
Roger. Did you say you had some updates for us in the lunar surface book. Over.
Negative. At this time, we do not have any updates for the lunar surface book. We wanted you to have it just in case. Over.
Roger. You were cut out that time.
Roger. At the present time, we do not have any updates for you on the lunar surface book. We are thinking about some and kicking them around, but they're very minor changes. Over.
11, Houston. Did you copy that transmission?
Apollo 11, Houston. We swapped antennas on you again. I say again that we do not have any lunar surface update - book updates at this time. We're considering a few minor ones, but we're still kicking them around the MOCR. Over.
Apollo 11, I understand.
Houston, 11. We have a crew status report for you.
Roger. Go ahead, 11.
Okay. Radiation: CDR 11009, CMP 10010, LMP 09011. No medication.
Roger, 11. We copy for the radiations. And, we're considering - this PTC looks sort of weird to us, so we're considering stopping and starting over again, and we'll be with you in a couple of minutes. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We switched the antennas on you again. Would you please give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Go ahead. 11 here.
Roger. We switched antennas on you, there, moments ago, Neil. Could you please give us the LM/CM DELTA-P reading? Over.
It's less than 0.1.
Roger.
0.15, now, Neil says, Charlie.
Roger. Thank you, Mike. Could you give us some help? This PTC is strange: it's not like anything we've seen before. We were wondering if you have had any events or any odd data that could help us out. Over.
I didn't understand that. Say again.
Roger. We're looking at a - sort of a funny looking PTC. We've already drifted out to 70 degrees in pitch and we're wondering if you all have had any vents or any such thing as that, that could have caused us to pick up these rates to drive us off. Over.
Negative, Charlie. We don't know of anything.
Roger.
Unless it's got something to do with that entry from the position that we want to be in. I don't know.
Roger. When we started off, it looked real fine to us. Now it's drifting off with a funny pattern that we haven't seen previously on a flight. And we're just trying to figure out - I think we'll probably start it over again. We'll be with you momentarily. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. We hate to say it, but we'd like to terminate this PTC and start over again. We have no assurance that we're going to get it through the sleep period with this funny configuration, or funny pattern. We'd like you to stop it now and go back to pitch 090, yaw 0, and roll - whatever you stop on. Over.
Roger.
11, Houston. We recommend you disable Bravo and Charlie; select quads Alfa and Delta. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Hello, Apollo 11. Over.
... Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Roger. Reading you about one-by. Looks like we picked a super attitude here for PTC stabilization. We're reading you in BACKUP VOICE now. Over.
Roger. We read you loud and clear.
Roger.
Would you like us to pick another antenna?
I think we've got about the best configuration. We've been doing it all from the ground here, 11. We'll just keep it as it is. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you select COMMAND RESET and OMNI Alfa? Over.
Houston, 11 on OMNI Alfa.
Roger. We read you about three-by now. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. We is stable; you can start the PTC. Over.
...
Houston, Apollo 11. Checklist page F9 7; I've completed step 8, and I'd like to know what you think is ideal timing between step 8, step 9, and step 10 on that page? Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. We don't see any time constraint. We'd like you to go ahead and set up the wide deadband and then go through step 10 and 11. Over.
Okay. Will do. I don't see any constraint here, Charlie. I was just checking to make sure, because last time, I went from 8 to 9 to 10 to 11 a little bit more swiftly than I'd been doing in the past.
Roger.
Step 11 complete.
Roger. We copy.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you please select OMNI Bravo? Over.
Roger. Bravo.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on Bravo?
Roger. Reading you five-by.
Same here.
Apollo 11, Houston. Looks like we've got a good PTC going. It's good night from the White Team. Over.
Okay. See you tomorrow. Thank you for everything.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Do you have any idea where the S IVB is with respect to us?
Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. The S IVB is about 6000 nautical miles from you now. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11. How's the PTC looking?
Stand by.
11, Houston. The PTC looks great to us. Over.
Hey, do you have any idea what happened to the previous one?
We have absolutely no idea. Over.
Okay. Did, it look like it was all right, then just all of a sudden start diverging?
That's negative, Mike. If you'll look at the plot, which we'll save for you and let you see it postflight, it started off immediately on the first REV and just spiraled out to about - oh 20 to - 20 degrees in pitch, and then it seemed to be setting up a spiral around an offset pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees; but we didn't want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point. We thought it might diverge, and so we called you and started over again. Over.
Okay, no complaints. I was just curious as to what had happened.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Goddard voice, Houston COMM TECH. Goss conference.
You're loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Read you the same.
Roger.
Madrid, Houston COMM TECH. Net 1, voice check.
Houston COMM TECH, Madrid. I read you loud and clear.
Roger. Read you loud and clear also.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. Good morning.
Good morning. Are you planning a midcourse correction 4 this morning?
That's negative. Midcourse number 4 is not required. We were going to let you sleep in until about 71 hours if you'd like to turn over.
Okay. That'll be fine.
Say again, Buzz. You were cut off there.
Okay. I'll see you at 71 hours.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Good morning again, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger 11. Good morning. When you - -
Would you like the O<sub>2</sub> purge this morning?
Yes indeed. O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge at 71 hours, and when you feel like copying, I've got a flight plan update containing - I guess that and some other items for you.
Okay. Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead with the flight plan update.
Roger, 11. This is Houston. At approximately 71 hours to 72 hours, we have you down for an eat period which I imagine is probably in progress already. 71 hours: O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge; 72 hours GET: CO<sub>2</sub> filter change number 6, secondary radiator flow check. And we'll send you up a P37 block data on a 2 hour pass, pericynthion pass, return mode abort. At 73 hours 00 minutes: stop PTC at approximately 0 degrees roll. That is, when you're coming up on 0 degrees roll angle around 73 hours, we'd like you to stop PTC. And perform a P52 option 3 remaining in the PTC REFSMMAT for a drift check. 73 hours, 20 minutes: we'll give you a P27 update to the landing site REFSMMAT, LOI 1 state vector, and target load. 73 hours 30 minutes: maneuver to 000 roll, pitch, and yaw; high gain antenna angles will be pitch 0, yaw 335; and perform a P52 option 1 using the new landing site REFSMMAT. Resume the nominal flight plan at 74 hours GET. Over.
Okay. We'll get started on the fuel cell purge while we're eating. CO<sub>2</sub> canister change number 6; secondary radiator flow check; copy some pads. Also at 72 hours, stop PTC 0 roll at 73; do a P52 option 3; we'll get your uplink REFSMMAT for the landing site; and at 000 - let's see, now was this with the old REFSMMAT or the new REFSMMAT?
This is with the - -
- - ... antenna and, pitch - -
- - This is with the new REFSMMAT, Buzz.
You said you want the P52 done at that attitude with the new REFSMMAT?
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, go ahead.
Roger, 11. Correction on my last. At 73 20, we uplink you the new REFSMMAT. And at 73 30, we'd like you to maneuver to 0 roll, 0 pitch, 0 yaw in the old REFSMMAT. And then torque around to the new REFSMMAT and run your P52 option 1 in that same inertial attitude. Over.
Roger, Understand.
I've got consumables update, when you're ready to copy.
I just got up, but you didn't catch me on that one.
I say I have one for you.
Okay. We're ready to copy that consumable update.
Roger. As of GET 68 00, RCS total minus 4.5 percent, corresponding to approximately minus 53 pounds. Alfa minus 6.0 percent, minus 1.0 percent, minus 7.0 percent, minus 3.0 percent; H<sub>2</sub> total, minus 1.2 pounds; O<sub>2</sub> total, plus 10 pounds. Over.
Roger. And our readouts on board are Alfa is 82, Bravo is 84, Cocoa is 84, and Delta is 87.
Houston. Roger. Out.
And you want us to cycle the O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> fans, I imagine?
11, this is Houston. Affirmative. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. I have a status report for you.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. On sleep; CDR, CMP, 7.5; LMP, 6.5. Over.
Roger. 7.5 for each. Over.
Negative. LMP 6.5.
Roger. 7.5, 7.5 and 6.5. And I got a few words for you here on the SPS engine performance. Over.
Okay. We're ready to listen.
Okay, 11. It turns out that the engine performance during both of your burns so far this mission has been the same as it was on engine acceptance tests. The onboard PC reading is due to a known gage calibration factor between what you've actually got in the chamber and what you're reading out on the gage. We expect single bank operation to be 90 - that is, 90 psi on the gage with an actual chamber pressure of 95 psi. In dual bank operation, the chamber pressure is 94 psi on the gage with an actual of 99 psi. 80 psi on the gage on board correlates to 83 psi actual. And we recommend that you stick to an LOI termination cue of 80 psi on the gage. That is, no change to the mission rules. Over.
Apollo 11. Roger. We got all that.
Houston. Out.
Houston. Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Houston, do you read Apollo 11?
Roger, 11. We're reading you loud and clear now. We were down in the noise as we switched antennas a minute or so ago. Over.
Roger. What sort of settings could you recommend for the solar corona? We've got the Sun right behind the edge of the Moon now.
Roger.
It's quite an erie sight. There is a very marked three dimensional aspect of having the Sun's corona coming from behind the Moon the way it is.
Roger.
And it looks as though - I guess what's giving it that three dimensional effect is the earthshine. I can see Tycho fairly clearly - at least if I'm right side up, I believe it's Tycho, in moonshine - I mean, in earthshine. And, of course, I can see the sky is lit all the way around the Moon, even on the limb of it where there's no earthshine or sunshine.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. If you'd like to take some pictures, we recommend using magazine Uniform which is loaded with high speed black and white film, interior lights off, electric Hasselblad with the 80 millimeter lens. And you're going to have to hand hold us, I guess. We're recommending an f stop of 2.8, and we'd like to get a sequence of time exposures. Over.
Okay. You want magazine Uniform instead of magazine Tango? Over.
Roger. We're not trying to get you all wrapped up in a procedure here. This is on a not to interfere basis, of course. Over.
Okay.
And on the exposures we're looking for an eighth of a second, a half a second. And, if you think you can steady the camera against anything to get longer exposures, 2 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds. Over.
Roger. We copy.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We'd like to do a little CRYO tank balancing. So, if you could position the oxygen tank number 1 heater switch to OFF and hydrogen tank 2 heater switch to OFF leaving all the rest of the CRYO switches the same, we'll let it run that way for a few hours. Over.
Okay. Stand by one on those switches. We'll get them in a minute.
Roger. And how far out can you see the corona extending? Over.
... bit like zodiacal light. It keeps going out farther and farther. We'll talk about it a little more later.
Roger. Out.
... We've got quite a few pictures ...
Apollo 11, this is Houston. I think we have COMM again. We heard you calling. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Were you calling? Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Understand you want the heaters OFF for hydrogen tank 1 and oxygen tank 1. Is that affirmative?
That's negative, Mike. Hydrogen tank number 2 heaters OFF and oxygen tank number 1 heaters OFF.
Okay.
Roger. Out.
I have hydrogen tank number 2 heaters OFF; I have oxygen tank number 1 heaters OFF.
Roger. Out.
Houston. Apollo 11. The earthshine coming through the window is so bright you can read a book by it.
Oh, very good.
And, Houston, I'd suggest that along the ecliptic line we can see the corona light out to two lunar diameters from this location. The bright light only extends out about an eighth to a quarter of the lunar radius.
Roger. Understand that you can see the corona approximately 200 solar diameters out along the ecliptic, and the bright light extends out approximately one eighth to one quarter lunar radius. Over.
That's two lunar - two lunar diameters along the ecliptic in the bright part, right; a quarter to an eighth of a lunar radius out, and that's perpendicular to the ecliptic line on the South Pole.
Roger.
Houston, it's been a real change for us. Now we are able to see stars again and recognize constellations for the first time on the trip. It's - the sky is full of stars. Just like the nightside of Earth. But all the way here, we have only been able to see stars occasionally and perhaps through the monocular, but not recognize any star patterns.
I guess it has turned into night up there really, hasn't it ?
Really has.
11, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
Okay. We went to HIGH GAIN. Looks like you had a little trouble getting signal strength there.
Roger. We missed an OMNI switch there. Over.
All right. On the secondary loop check when we went to FLOW on the secondary radiators, the quantity dropped from 40 percent down to 36 in the first 10 seconds and then stabilized at 36 for the remainder of the 30 seconds.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We believe that is normal system operation. The radiators are expected to be very cold right now and apparently the decrease you saw was due to contraction in the fluid. Over.
Okay. We will go ahead with the procedure just as if there were no decrease in accumulator quantity. Right?
Roger. Press on.
And, Houston, the secondary radiator flow check is complete and satisfactory.
Houston. Roger. Out.
And that's a good deal because we don't have to have any meetings about whether we're going to do it or don't do it any more.
That's for sure.
The Flight Director says "ouch."
No. No "ouch" intended. I enjoyed every one of those meetings.
11, this is Houston. I have your pericynthion plus 2 PAD, P30 format; when you're ready to copy.
Roger. Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy pericynthion plus 2.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Pericynthion plus 2 hours PAD. SPS G&N: 62710, plus 098, minus 019, GET ignition 077 46 2248, DELTA-VX NOUN 81, plus 32148, minus 00455, minus 10377, roll NA, pitch 307, and the remainder of the PAD is NA. GDC align stars Vega and Deneb. Roll 243 183 012, no ullage. Remarks: Assumes landing site REFSMMAT and docked. Over.
Roger. SPS G&N: 62710, plus 098, minus 019, 077 46 2248, plus 32148, minus 00455, minus 10377, NA, 307, Vega and Deneb, 243 183 012, no ullage, landing site REFSMMAT, docked. And I need a change on the LM weight. Over.
No change in the LM's weight - in the LM weight, and the readback is correct. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. We're having difficulty getting commands into the spacecraft. We'd like you to cycle your UP TELEMETRY switch to COMMAND RESET and OFF and then back to NORMAL. Over.
Okay. We'll do it.
We have you on high gain right now. You want us to switch over to OMNI?
Negative. We Would like to stay on the high gain if we can. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. We'd like you to switch to OMNI Delta as we show you approximately at the scan limit of the high gain antenna. Now we will then command OMNI Delta down here after you advise us you've switched, and then you can select Bravo on board and we will be back in the OMNI antenna commanding business. Over.
Okay. We're going to Delta now.
11, Houston. You can go ahead and select OMNI Bravo on board now.
...
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, we can read you up the morning news here.
Go right ahead; let's hear it.
Roger. Hot from the wires of the MSC Public Affairs Office, especially prepared for the crew of Apollo 11.
Okay. First off, it looks like it's going to be impossible to get away from the fact that you guys are dominating all the news back here on Earth. Even Pravda in Russia is headlining the mission and calls Neil, "The Czar of the Ship." I think maybe they got the wrong mission.
West Germany has declared Monday to be "Apollo Day." School children in Bavaria have been given the day off. Post Office clerks have been encouraged to bring radios to work and Frankfurt is installing TV sets in public places.
BBC in London is considering a special radio alarm system to call people to their TV sets in case there is a change in the EVA time on the Moon.
And in Italy, Pope Paul VI has arranged for a special color TV circuit at his summer residence in order to watch you, even though Italian television is still black and white.
Back here in Houston, your three wives and children got together for lunch yesterday at Buzz's house. And according to Pat, it turned out to be a gabfest. The children swam and did some high jumping over at Buzz's bamboo pole.
In Moscow, space engineer Anatol Koritsky was quoted by TASS as saying that Luna 15 could accomplish everything that has been done by earlier Luna spacecraft. This was taken by the press to mean Luna 15 could investigate the gravitational fields, photograph the Moon, and go down to the surface to scoop up a bit for analysis.
Even the kids at camp got into the news when Mike Jr. was quoted as replying "yeah" when somebody asked him if his daddy was going to be in history. Then after a short pause he asked, "What is history?" In Washington, President Nixon is planning to use his executive power to streamline the Interstate Commerce Commission. According to industry sources, it was reported Nixon would trim the commission from 11 to 7 members by not making new appointments.
And the big news around Houston today concerns the Astros. In the sports world, the Houston Astros rallied in the ninth inning at Cincinnati to dump the Reds 7 to 4. Going into the ninth however, things looked pretty bleak. The Astros were trailing 4 to 3. Then with one out, Jesus Alou stroked a single to right field. John Edwards hit another single to right, and Sandy Valdespino hit a double to bring in the tying run. Julio Gotay was walked and Joe Morgan dropped a bunt for the game winning play. A wild throw to the plate allowed another run to score, then a sacrifice fly by Dennis Menke brought in the final run. They really came through in the ninth.
And other games in the National League - -
Yes. Those Astros have really been catching those flies since they put a roof on the stadium.
Good work.
In other games in the National League, New York beat Montreal 5 to 2; Pittsburgh beat St. Louis 4 to 1; and Atlanta over San Diego in the first game of a double header 6 to 2.
In the American League, Detroit beat Cleveland 4 to nothing; New York trounced Washington 5 to nothing; Baltimore outhit - Boston outhit Baltimore to score 6 runs to the Orioles' 2; and Chicago beat Kansas City 6 to 1.
Okay. In golf world, Tommy Jacobs, an infrequent competitor in recent years, took the lead in the Philadelphia Golf Classic yesterday. His second round score was 139.
You might be interested in knowing, since you are already on the way, that a Houston astrologer, Ruby Graham, says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. She says that Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses, but he is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also supposed to have "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling." Buzz is to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she has decided that he either has the same attributes as Neil or he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative.
And last but not - -
Who said all that?
(Laughter) Ruby Graham, an astrologer here in Houston. Now we check with Flight Operations for all the signs for the mission, and then we, of course, had to make sure that everything was really all set.
Houston, 11. You're cutting out ...
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're switching OMNI's. Can you stand by for about 2 minutes?
Houston, 11. Radio check.
11, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. You cut out after Tommy Jacobs. I guess we got into antenna switching problems.
Okay. Following Tommy Jacobs, we have the hot smoking word from a local Houston astrologer by the name of Ruby Graham. She says that all the signs are right for your trip to the Moon. Neil is clever, Mike has good judgment, and Buzz can work out intricate problems. She also says Neil tends to see the world through rose colored glasses but is always ready to help the afflicted or distressed. Neil, you are also supposed to have "intuition that enables you to interpret life with feeling," Buzz is supposed to be very sociable and cannot bear to be alone in addition to having excellent critical ability. Since she didn't know at what hour Mike was born, she decided he either has the same attributes as Neil or that he is inventive with an unconventional attitude that might seem eccentric to the unimaginative. And that's 30 for today. Over.
Thank you much there, Bruce and Fred Show, we appreciate that.
Roger.
Did you hear our comment about the Astros?
The one about the roof?
Yes.
Hey, Mike, the game was at Cincinnati there, and we think that they're still using Crosby Field up there. I don't believe it has a roof on it.
You got him on that one.
Right - -
I think they're just getting to be a good team in the clinch.
They certainly seem to be.
Well, if they can do that well without a roof, think of what they're going to do with a roof.
Roger. Out.
We're trying.
An old Oiler fan is trying to comment on an alien game.
You tell Michael Jr., history or no history, he'd better behave himself.
Roger. We'll pass that along, Mike.
Apollo 11, Houston. If it's convenient with you, we have an LOI 1 PAD that we can pass up to you now. Over.
Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. The next time we pass through roll 0, we're going to stop PTC and that will give us 90 degrees pitch. Now, I understand you want us to move from 90 degrees pitch to 0 degrees pitch for the platform align, option 1. Is that affirmative?
Standby, please.
And we are ready to copy on the LOI 1.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. When you stop at 0 roll, you will be in approximately 90 pitch, 0 yaw, and 0 roll. We'd like you to run the first P52, that is, the P52 option 3, from that attitude. Then we'll uplink you a new REFSMMAT, either before or while you are maneuvering to 000, and then you can torque the platform around and run the second REFSMMAT. Over. Run the second P52. Over.
Okay.
And I copied you are ready for the LOI 1 pad. Over.
Go ahead.
LOI 1, SPS G&N: 62710, plus 098, minus 019, GET ignition 075 49 4965, minus 28897, minus 03944, minus 00686. Roll 358, pitch 226, 347; 01692, plus 00610; 29173 602 29108; sextant star 31 1066 358. Remainder of the PAD is NA. GDC align Vega and Deneb 243 183 012. No ullage. The horizon will be visible just below the upper edge of the hatch window 2 minutes prior to the LOI burn. It will not be visible in the rendezvous window on the left hand side. LOS at 75 hours 41 minutes 23 seconds. AOS at 76 15 29. AOS without the LOI burn 76 05 30. The values which you would see on NOUN 42 prior to LOI burn are HA plus 431.3, HP minus 128.2. Readback. Over.
Roger. LOI 1, SPS G&N: 62710, plus 098, minus 019, 075 49 4965, minus 28897, minus 03944, minus 00686; 358 226 347; 01692, plus 00610; 29173 602 29108; 31 106.6 358. GDC align Vega and Deneb 243 183 012. No ullage. Horizon in the hatch window 2 minutes before TIG. AOS with an LOI 76 15 29. AOS without an LOI 76 05 30. HA before the burn 431.3, HP minus 128.2. Say again LOS time.
Roger. LOS time 75 41 23. Over.
Understand 75 41 23.
11, this is Houston. Readhack correct. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. Apparently we missed getting your onboard readouts on battery Charlie and PYRO batteries Alfa and Bravo last night. I wonder if you could give us some fresh numbers. Over.
You want the readings now?
Yes, please. If it's convenient for you.
Okay. All three of them are still 37.1.
Roger. 37.1 cubed. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11. The P52 option 3 is complete. We're maneuvering to 000.
Roger. We observe your maneuvering, and we'll have some uplinks for you in a couple of minutes here.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We observe you're in P00. If you'll give us ACCEPT, we'll start our uplinks.
You've got it, Houston.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We're on low bit rate at the present time so it's going to take us a little bit longer than normal to get this stuff up to you. Over.
I guess we're in no rush.
Okay. We're here if you're there.
The view of the Moon that we've been having recently is really spectacular. It fills about three quarters of the hatch window, and of course, we can see the entire circumference, even though part of it is in complete shadow and part of it's in earthshine. It's a view worth the price of the trip.
Well, there are a lot of us down here that would be willing to come along.
I hope you get your turn, and soon.
One of these days, we'll be able to bring the whole MOCR along, I hope. Save a lot of antenna switching.
Say again, 11.
One of these days, we could bring the whole MOCH along, and then that'll save a lot of antenna switching.
That's jolly.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, this is Houston. We're showing you - -
The Czar is brushing his teeth, so I'm filling in for him.
Say again, please.
I said the Czar is brushing his teeth, so I'm filling in for him. What can we do for you?
Roger. If you don't get in the way of the Czar while he's brushing his teeth, we'd like you to bring up the primary accumulator quantity a little bit. We're showing the quantity now at 20.6 percent on TM. Seems to have gone down a bit since you've gone into the shadow. We'd like it serviced to bring the quantity up to between 30 and 40 percent, preferable 35 percent. Over.
Okay.
The computer is yours, 11. The loads are in and verified. You can go back to BLOCK.
We're in BLOCK.
11, this is Houston. On the basis of your last P52 alignment, the platform looks like it's indeed performing very well. No problems there, no updates required, and no PIPA bias update is required either. Over.
Sounds good.
Houston, Apollo 11. Radio check.
11, this is Houston. Loud and clear. Over.
Okay. Just checking. Do you want high gain?
Roger. If you can give it to us.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on the high gain?
Loud and clear on the high gain.
Same here. We've completed the P52 option 1.
Roger. We've been looking over your shoulder by TM.
Glad to have you.
Houston, Apollo 11. Standing by to copy TEI 1 and TEI 4. Over.
Roger. I've got the 1 and 4 PAD's here, right now. I'll be ready to read them up to you in just a second.
11, this is Houston. I'm ready with the TEI 1 and 4 PAD's. Over.
Ready to copy.
Roger. TEI 1, SPS G&N: 38658, minus 054, plus 065, TIG 078 02 0345, plus 29180, plus 03779, minus 01325; roll NA, pitch 041. The balance of the PAD is NA. Ullage two jets, 19 seconds. TEI 4 PAD, SPS G&N: 38658, minus 054, plus 065, TIG 084 29 5059, plus 31373, plus 03760, minus 00968; roll NA, pitch 034. The rest of the PAD is NA. Ullage two jets, 19 seconds. Both of these PAD's are for an undocked maneuver. TEI plus 4 PAD assumes no LOI-2. Over. Make that TEI 4 PAD assumes no LOI-2.
Roger. TEI 1, SPS G&N: 38658, minus 054, plus 065, 078 02 0345, plus 29180, plus 03779, minus 01325; roll NA, pitch 041; two jets, 19 seconds, undocked. TEI 4: 38658, minus 054, plus 065, 084 29 5059, plus 31373, plus 03760, minus 00968; roll NA, pitch 034; two jets, 19 seconds, undocked; assumes no LOI-2.
11, this is Houston - -
- - Apollo 11. Over.
- - 11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. At GET of 74 30, we'd like you to cycle the fans in all four CRYO tanks and position the heaters in all four CRYO tanks to the AUTO position. We're doing this in advance of LOI in order to insure that you don't have any destratification as a result of the burn, which might result in giving you a master caution and warning during the burn. Over.
Okay. Was that 74 30? You want us to cycle the heaters and turn - cycle the fans and turn all the heaters on.
All the heaters to AUTO; cycle the fans at 74 30, about 25 minutes from now. Over.
Okay.
11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Houston, 11.
Roger. Loud and clear now.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Apparently this is not a very good OMNI attitude for you. We're ready to start our PTC check.
11, this is Houston. We're ready, except that we'd like to get the high gain antenna prior to this test. Over.
Can you give us a couple of pointing angles?
Roger. From an attitude with 60 degrees roll, around to an attitude of roll 058 inertial. It would be pitch plus 30 and yaw 270 on the high gain antenna.
Thank you.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. We're reading you weak but clear.
Roger. We put our - our roll for MSFN track in on the wrong side. Going to continue rolling around until we get high gain here. And, we'll delete the - the pitch that was scheduled after the TVC check.
Say again please, 11.
Roger. We put the wrong sign in - -
Roger.
- - for the roll correction to get MSFN high gain, and we're continuing rolling around to get the proper attitude for high gain at this time. We will delete the pitch maneuver that was scheduled subsequent to - subsequent to the TV check since we already have those pictures.
Roger. We copy. And we recommend that you go ahead and complete your TVC test on board. If you have problems, we'll talk to you when you get around further into the high gain antenna attitude. Over.
Roger.
Houston, how do you read on high gain?
Oh, loud and clear on high gain, 11.
Roger. We're proceeding.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We observed your gimbal test down here, and it looked good to us. Over.
Roger. It looked good here.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Loud and clear.
Roger. And your systems are looking good from down here.
Yes. Looks good up here too, Bruce.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead Houston, Apollo 11.
11, this is Houston. You are GO for LOI. Over.
Roger. GO for LOI.
And we're showing about 10 minutes and 30 seconds to LOS. I would like to remind you to enable the BD roll on the AUTO RCS switches. Over.
Roger. And confirm you want PCM low going over the hill. Over.
That's affirmative, 11.
Roger.
If you want to, I'll put it back to high until just before LOS. Over.
Negative, 11. Low is okay for now. Over.
Roger.
Houston, do you want to give me a time check, please?
Roger. I'll give you a Mark at 13 minutes and 30 seconds to ignition.
Okay. And then a GET, please.
Stand by a minute.
Okay.
I'll give you a time hack on the GET at 75 hours 37 minutes and I'll try that bias at about a second and a half to allow for the time of flight.
Okay.
Stand by.
MARK.
75 hours 37 minutes GET.
Thank you.
And I'll give you a time hack on time to ignition at 12 minutes to ignition. Over.
Okay.
Stand by for a Mark at TIG minus 12.
MARK.
TIG minus 12.
You were right on, Bruce. Thank you.
Roger. Out.
Two minutes to LOS.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. All your systems are looking good going around the corner, and we'll see you on the other side. Over.
Roger.
Everything looks okay up here.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
...
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. We are reading you weakly. Go ahead. Over.
Roger. Burn status report follows. DELTA-TIG zero, burn time 557, ... VGX minus O.1, VGY minus 0.1, VGZ plus 0.1, DELTA-VC minus 0.390, fuel, plus 3 ... 42. Over.
11, this is Houston. These residuals, do you have minus 0.1?
... VGX minus 0.1, VGY minus 0.1, VGZ 1.1, and a burn time of 5 plus 57. Stand by, maybe the COMM will improve a little bit. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Are you in the process of acquiring data on the burn? Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read?
Reading you loud and clear, Houston. How us?
Roger. Reading you the same, now. Could you repeat your burn status report? We copied the residuals and burn time, and that was about it. Send the whole thing again, please.
It was like - like perfect! DELTA-TIG zero, burn time 557, shaft value on the angles, VGX minus 0.1, VGY minus 0.1, VGZ plus 0.1, no trim, minus 6.8 on DELTA-VC, fuel was 38.8, LOX 39.0, plus 50 on balance, and we ran an increase on the PUGS, NOUN 44 showed us in a 60.9 by 169.9.
Roger. We copy your burn status report. And the spacecraft is looking good to us on telemetry.
Everything looks good up here.
Apollo 11 is getting its first view of the landing approach. This time we are going over the Taruntius crater, and the pictures and maps brought back by Apollo 8 and 10 have given us a very good preview of what to look at here. It looks very much like the pictures, but like the difference between watching a real football game and watching it on TV. There's no substitute for actually being here.
Roger. We concur, and we surely wish we could see it firsthand, also.
We're going over the Messier series of craters right at the time, looking vertically down on them, and Messier A we can see good sized blocks in the bottom of the crater. I don't know what our altitude is now, but in any case, those are pretty good size blocks.
Okay. Just roughly, it looks like you are about 120 miles or 130 miles right now - make that 127 miles.
We're approaching PDI point now. Over.
There's Secchi in sight.
We're going over Mount Marilyn at the present time, and it's ignition point.
Roger. Thank you. And our preliminary tracking data for the first few minutes shows you in a 61.6 by 169.5 orbit. Over.
Roger.
And Jim is smiling.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
11, Houston. During your SPS burn as played back on tape down here, we've observed the nitrogen tank Bravo pressure in the SPS system dropping a little bit more than we anticipated. It's holding steady right now. We'll continue to watch it and keep you posted if anything comes up. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Right. And it has held steady - -
Currently going over Maskelyne Mas -
Okay.
And Boothill, Duke Island, Sidewinder, looking at Maskelyne W, that's the yaw round checkpoint, and just coming into the terminator. At the terminator it's ashen and gray. As you get further away from the terminator, it gets to be a lighter gray, and as you get closer to the subsolar point, you can definitely see browns and tans on the ground, according to the last Apollo 11 observation anyway.
Roger, 11. We're recording your comments for posterity.
(Laughter) Okay.
Did somebody in the background - do they accuse us of being compromisers? Huh!
And landing site is well into the dark here. I don't think we're going to be able to see anything of the landing site this early.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. When you have a free minute, could you give us your onboard readout of N<sub>2</sub> tank Bravo, please. And we'd like to make sure you understand that ever since you stopped thrusting with the SPS, the temperature in this tank has remained steady. Over. Make that the pressure has remained steady.
Roger. We understand tank pressure has stayed steady. Thank you.
Roger. We're showing the N<sub>2</sub> tank pressure and the tank Bravo to he 1960, something like that, and Alfa is, oh, about 2250. Over.
Roger. We show 2249 in Alfa and 1946 down here.
All right.
Houston, Apollo 11. How about coming up with some roll, pitch, and yaw angles in which to stop this so called ORB RATE that I'm doing.
Roger. Standby.
We'll have them for you in a minute, 11.
Okay. And time to stop also, please.
Yes, indeed.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We show you, in the flight plan, staying in orbital rate until about 79 hours 10 minutes. Do you have some particular attitude or reason for wanting to go inertial? Over.
No, that's fine. I just wanted to confirm that. Until 79 10, then we'll breeze around here in orbit.
Roger. And we've got an observation you can make if you have some time up there. There's been some lunar transient events reported in the vicinity of Aristarchus. Over.
Roger. We just went into spacecraft darkness. Until then, why, we couldn't see a thing down below us. But now, with earthshine, the visibility is pretty fair. Looking back behind me, now, I can see the corona from where the Sun has just set. And we'll get out the map and see what we can find around Aristarchus
We're coming upon Aristarchus right now - -
- - Okay. Aristarchus is at angle Echo 9 on your ATO chart. It's about 394 miles north of track. However, at your present altitude, which is about 167 nautical miles, it ought to be over - that is within view of your horizon: 23 degrees north, 47 west. Take a look and see if you see anything worth noting up there. Over.
Both looking.
Roger. Out.
Houston, 11. It might help us a little bit if you could give us a time of crossing of 45 west.
Say again, please, 11.
You might give us a time of crossing of 45 west, and then we'll know when to start searching for Aristarchus.
Roger. You'll be crossing 45 west at 77 04 10 or about 40 seconds from now. Over. Thirty seconds from now.
Okay.
Apollo 11, when we lose the S-band, we'd like to get OMNI Charlie from you. And update my last, that 77 04 was the time when Aristarchus should become visible over your horizon. 77 12 is point of closest approach south of it. Over.
Okay. That sounds better because we just went by Copernicus a little bit ago.
Roger. We show you at about 27 degrees longitude right now.
Righto.
Houston, when a star sets up here, there's no doubt about it. One instant it's there, and the next instant it's just completely gone.
Roger. We copy.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We request you use OMNI Charlie at this time. Over.
Okay. Going to OMNI Charlie.
Roger. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Seems to me since we know orbits so precisely, and know where the stars are so precisely, and the time of setting of a star or a planet to so very fine a degree, that this might be a pretty good means of measuring the altitude of the horizon ...
Roger.
Hey, Houston. I'm looking north up toward Aristarchus now, and I can't really tell at that distance whether I am really looking at Aristarchus, but there's an area that is considerably more illuminated than the surrounding area. It just has - seems to have a slight amount of fluorescence to it. A crater can be seen, and the area around the crater is quite bright.
Roger, 11. We copy.
Houston, Apollo 11. Looking up at the same area now and it does seem to be reflecting some of the earthshine. I'm not sure whether it was worked out to be about zero phase to - Well, at least there is one wall of the crater that seems to be more illuminated than the others, and that one - if we are lining up with the Earth correctly, does seem to put it about at zero phase. That area is definitely lighter than anything else that I could see out this window. I am not sure that I am really identifying any phosphorescence, but that definitely is lighter than anything else in the neighborhood.
11, this is Houston. Can you discern any difference in color of the illumination, and is that an inner or an outer wall from the crater? Over.
Roger. That's an inner wall of the crater.
No, there doesn't appear to be any color involved in it, Bruce.
Roger. You said inner wall. Would that be the inner edge of the northern surface?
I guess it would be the inner edge of the westnorthwest part, the part that would be more nearly normal if you were looking at it from the Earth.
11, Houston. Have you used the monocular on this? Over.
Stand by one.
Roger. Like you to know this quest for science has caused me to lose my E memory program, it's in here somewhere, but I can't find it.
11, this is Houston. We're - we're hearing only a partial COMM. Say again please.
I think ...
Houston, we will give it a try if we have the opportunity on next - when we are not in the middle of lunch, and trying to find the monocular.
Roger. Copied you that time. Expect in the next REV you will probably be getting ready for LOI 2.
So, let's wind this up, and since we've got some other things to talk to you about in a few minutes. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, this is Houston. We're targeting - planning to make the LOI 2 burn now using bank A only. We'll have the PAD and everything for you next time around. Just trying to economise a little on bank B. Bank B is holding, though.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
11, Houston. In order to improve the communications a little bit here, we'd like to try to get you on the high gain antenna. We're recommending a pitch angle of 0, yaw 355 - I say again 355, the track switch to MANUAL, and wide beamwidth. Over.
Okay. You ready to switch to high gain now?
That's affirmative.
11, Houston. Do you read?
Roger. We read you. It seems to be rather marginal on the high gain.
Roger. We concur.
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you give us a time of crossing the prime meridian 150 west? Over.
Roger. Stand by about a half a second, here. Okay. Your time of crossing the 150 west meridian will be 77 50 05. Over.
Thank you.
11, this is Houston. We have about 6 minutes remaining until LOS, and in order that we may configure our ground lines, we'd like to know if you're still planning to have the TV up with the beginning of the next pass. Over.
Roger, Houston. We'll try to have it ready.
This is Houston. We are inquiring if it is your plan to. Over.
It never was our plan to; but it's in the flight plan, so I guess we'll do it.
Houston. Roger. Out.
11, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
For use in connection with the prime meridian crossing, you have an orbital period now of 2 hours 8 minutes and 37 seconds. Over.
Thank you.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. A little over 2 minutes to LOS. All your systems parameters and orbit are looking good from the ground. We have AOS on the other side at 78 23 31. Over.
Roger. 78 23 21.
Roger. That was 31 on the end.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
This is Apollo 11. Are you picking up our signals okay?
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Affirmative. We are reading you loud and clear on voice and we have a good clear TV picture, a little bright crater in the - -
- - No, no, no - -
- - the bottom of the picture. I guess that's the spot on the tube.
I'm sorry about that one.
And if you give us P00 and ACCEPT, we will uplink our new state vector and target load to you.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. One of the larger craters on the back side - I noticed a small, dark speck on the outer wall and I put the monocular on it. I was able to see - oh, an area maybe a quarter of a mile in diameter. It was really a freshlooking dark colored pit, and that seems to be in contrast with all the other fresh little craters or holes that you can perceive on the walls of any of these craters. Around this particular one there seems to be two or three of these - especially the one that caught my attention. Quite remarkable. Over.
Roger. Do you have a location on that one?
No, not a precise one. I've got several pictures of it, though.
Roger. We copy.
We're getting a beautiful picture in down there now, 11. The color's coming in quite clearly, and we can see the horizon and the relative blackness of space, and without getting into the question of grays and browns, it looks, at least on our monitor, sort of a brownish gray.
That's a good, reasonable way of describing it. It appears to me as though it made a difference just sitting back in the tunnel and gazing at all windows; it makes a difference which one you're looking out of. For example, the camera right now is looking out the number 5 window, and it definitely gives a rosier or tanner tinge, especially when you look straight through it and not at an angle. Over.
Roger.
And if you rear back 95 or 100 degrees ...
... Still holding ... Okay.
Say again, 11?
I'd say we're about 95 degrees east, coming up on Smyth's Sea.
Roger. And for your information, we show you at an altitude of about 92 miles above the surface right now.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you observe a difference in the N<sub>2</sub> pressures before LOI? It seems to me as though the two were not equal on the ... B tank was a little low on pressure. Over.
I'm flying it in SPS minimum impulse, Houston, and it's rather difficult to keep it on a constant data. The LM wants to wander up and down. I'm not sure if it's in response to MASCONN's or what, but I can get it completely stabilized in DATA and let it alone, and in another couple of minutes it will have developed its own rate.
This is Houston. Roger.
Houston, we'll be moving shortly from the side window to the hatch window, and we'll try and pick up some of the landmarks that we'll be looking at as we approach the powered descent. Over.
11, this is Houston. Roger. And we're through with the uplinks; the computer is yours. You can go to BLOCK and we'll have the information on nitrogen for you shortly. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Okay, Houston. Several minutes ago I was exactly steady on data, and since then I have been moving toward the LM, pointed straight down toward the radius vector, and that's been despite a number of down minimum pitch impulses.
Roger.
We're over Smyth's Sea right now.
Roger.
We're about 88 degrees east, I would estimate.
We show you about south of the - southwest of the crater Jansky right now.
Smyth Sea doesn't look much like a sea. It - The area which is devoid of craters, of which there's not very much, is sort of a hilly looking area. It's not like the maria at all.
Roger. We copy that about the sea, and it looks like you were just giving us a view of the crater Neper, the large crater on the left, and Jansky on the right.
We think you're close, but no cigar.
11, this is Houston. Would you care to comment on some of these craters as we go by?
Roger. We're approaching the approach path to ignition. This is equivalent to 13 minutes before ignition, and we're at about 83 degrees, I guess - 83 degrees east. That correspond to location you're holding there presently?
Roger. We're showing your present position as about 77 - 76 degrees east looking back towards the east.
Hey, you should be looking back at Smyth Sea now.
Roger.
Okay.
Houston, what you're seeing in the middle of the screen now is the crater Schubert and Gilbert U is in the center right now; and this comes up at about - a little over 12 minutes before power decent. Instead of me looking - Instead of looking back at it, we'd be looking straight down at it in descent.
Roger.
And we show you at an altitude now of about 110 miles; and, of course, you'll be considerably lower at the initiation of powered descent.
Okay, Houston. Look at register 3 on the DSKY data. This data is increasing toward my desired of 315; and I'll let the hand controller alone here, and I'll bet you it reverses itself.
Roger, 11. We're watching the DSKY now, and it's still coming in beautifully on the TV.
Okay. There's - on the right side of the screen at the present time, there's a triple crater with - with a small crater between the first and second; and the one at the bottom of the screen is Schubert Y. Zoom in; it does have a central peak in Schubert Y. Actually, several of them, and you can observe those plus the rim craters at the bottom of your screen.
Roger. We're seeing the central peak quite clearly now.
Okay. We're zooming in now on a crater called Schubert N. Schubert N, very conical inside walls and the bottom appears to be nearly flat.
Look at data on the DSKY. It's stabilized and is holding steady now.
Roger.
Looking out the window I can see a number of small craters on the bottom of Schubert N.
We're coming up on the Foaming Sea where I'll be doing some P22 marking on a crater of my choice, name of crater, Camp.
Okay. We'll be watching for Neper.
And notice register 3 has reversed itself, and it's heading back the other way now without any pitch thruster firing.
Roger, Mike. We confirm that you've changed the direction of your pitch rate.
Generally speaking - -
The crater - -
- - The tendency seems to be to pull the LM down toward the center of the Moon there as in a gravity gradient experiment.
Roger, 11. We copy - -
It may have something to do with MASSCON's or it may - -
Roger. We copy ...
...
It may have something to do with MASSCON's or it may just be the peculiarity of the DSKY display.
Okay. We've observed the behavior of your DSKY, and I think we've got the data here to work on it. Let us grind around a little while on it, and we'll report back to you, probably in a REV or two.
Okay. Well, in the meantime, I'm going to pitch down toward 315.
Roger.
Three craters - three horizontal craters that you now have in the field of view are immediately underneath the ground track. The right hand is the largest crater that you see, Dubiago P.
Roger. We concur on the identification of that crater.
And we show you coming up on landmark Alfa 1 here shortly.
Roger. Mike's having his first look at Alfa 1 at the present time.
Yea. It's a very bright crater. It's not a large one but an extremely bright one. It looks like a very recent and, I would guess, impact crater with rays streaming out in all directions which should make my - Correction - the Foaming Sea easy to see coming up on it now. Crater Camp is one of the smaller ones out on the - on the floor of the Foaming Sea.
Here we show you over the Sea of Fertility now, and we ought to have Langrenus down south of track a few degrees, about 9 degrees south of track.
Now the crater that's in the center of the screen now is Webb. We'd be looking straight down on it at about 6 minutes before power descent. It has a relatively flat bottom to the crater, and you can see maybe two or three craters that are in the bottom of it on the western wall, the wall that's now nearest the - the camera. Near the bottom of the screen, we can see a dimple crater, just on the outside. And then coming back toward the bottom of the screen and to the left, you can see a series of depressions. It's this type of connected craters that give us most interest to discover why they're in the particular pattern that they're in. I'll zoom the camera in now and try and give you a closer look at it.
Roger. We're observing the dimple crater now. The central peak we can see on the Orbiter photos doesn't seem to stand out very well here.
Well, they're not central peaks. They're depressions in the center.
Roger.
And you'll notice on the pitch thruster activity, I've still - I've put in a dozen minimum impulses in pitchdown, and I'm still far from correcting back to 315.
We're moving the camera over to the right window now to give you Langrenus, its - its several central peaks and -
Roger. We got Langrenus in our screen now.
Okay, 11. This is Houston. We're getting a beautiful picture of Langrenus now with its rather conspicuous central peak.
The Sea of Fertility doesn't look very fertile to me. I don't know who named it.
Well, it may have been named by a gentleman whom this crater was named after, Langrenus. Langrenus was a cartographer to the King of Spain and made one of the - one of the early reasonably accurate maps of the Moon.
Roger. That's very interesting - -
... at least it sounds better for our purposes than the Sea of Crises.
Amen to that.
Okay. It looks like you're coming inside now on the camera.
Well, I can't get behind to see the monitor. I'll bring the focus in, but we're going to be looking down past one of the LM quads and one of the antennas almost straight down at the ground track that we'll be seeing coming in now. I guess there's maybe 2 or 3 minutes before power descent.
All right, that should put the LM structure about in focus, and I'm going to move it out to infinity and then expand the field of view.
Crater Secchi is out my window now, window number 2.
Hello, Apollo 11. This is Houston. We show you coming up on the terminator at 78 53, about 7 minutes from now, and we've also got the LOI 2 and TEI 5 PAD's ready for you after the TV whenever you want to terminate. Over.
Roger.
And we're getting a good view of the track leading into the landing site now and -
Okay, And it looks like we got Secchi K, went by about 10 seconds ago; coming up on Apollo Ridge.
And in the right hand portion of our screen right now, we can see Messier Alfa and Bravo with the light colored rays streaming off in one direction.
I don't know if you can make out, but in the Sea of Fertility there are a number of craters that are just barely discernible, old, old craters whose outlines are just barely able to be seen.
Roger. I think we can make them out. The color really enhances our ability to discern features and craters over what we see in real time on our black and white monitor.
Right. The - At these low Sun angles, there's no trace of brown, it's now returned to a very gray appearance and, like the 8 crew says, it has a look of plaster of paris to it at this Sun angle, which is completely lacking in ...
Roger.
Okay. This is very close to ignition point for power descent. Just passing Mount Marilyn that - that triangular shaped mountain that you see in the center of the screen at the present time with crater Secchi Theta on top of the far northern edge of the mountain.
Roger. We're getting a good view of Mount Marilyn and the Secchi Theta.
And now we're looking at what we call Boot Hill; occurs 20 seconds into the descent.
The bright, sharp rimmed crater at the very right edge of the screen, Censorinus T. Now passing the - the 1 minute point in power descent.
Roger. And for your information, your current altitude is 148 nautical miles above the surface.
Don't you think?
I'm unable to determine altitude at all looking out the window. I couldn't tell whether we were down at 60 or up at 170.
I bet you could tell if you were down at 50,000 feet.
I wouldn't be surprised.
We're passing some steep ridges here. The edge of some old craters that were photographed by Apollo 10; and those - the crew of Apollo 10 was very impressed with the steepness of these ridges when they came over them at about 50,000 feet.
Roger. We can observe they're also steep even from this altitude. You got quite a shadow being cast by the Sun at these low angles.
The entire surface is getting considerably darker than the surface that we looked at previously when the Sun was quite high above us. The crater in the - bright crater in the center of the screen, - well, the smaller one is Censorinus.
Roger. And we show you low over 1 minute from the terminator at the present time.
How's the brightness of the picture you're receiving? You think we ought to open f stop some as we approach the terminator?
Yes. The brightness is still doing quite well. You can go ahead and open it up a stop or two. The automatic light level compensation seems to be working beautifully.
There's a good picture of Boot Hill.
Roger. We're - -
Three minutes and 15 seconds into the descent.
Roger. We're seeing Boot Hill now.
The next crater coming into the bottom, that's Duke Island right there, and to the left, the crater - the largest of the craters near the center of the picture right now is Maskelyne W. This is a position check during descent at about 3 minutes and 39 seconds, and it's our down range position check and cross range position check prior to yawing over face up to acquire the landing radar. Past this point, we would be unable to see the surface below us until getting very near the landing area.
Roger. I imagine you'll get a - you'll get a real good look at that tomorrow afternoon.
Sinuous Rille is the one that was referred to in Apollo 10 as Sidewinder.
That's a good name, too: Sidewinder and Diamondback. It looks like a couple of snakes down there in a lake bed.
And we're approaching the terminator now. See the - -
Roger.
Contrast has increased and only the sunlit side of these ridges remain illuminated, while the dark sides and the shadow will become completely black.
11, this is Houston. The picture's getting a little grainy now. You might go ahead and open up the f stop.
Landing point is just barely in the darkness. That one crater, the upper part of which you see, lower part completely in darkness. The small, well defined crater is Moltke, which is about abeam of the landing sight.
Roger. We can just see; it looks like a little less than half of its rim right now.
And we can make out just barely some features on the surface, maybe from earthshine.
Are you wide open on the f stop at this time?
Yes, we are.
Yes. And it looks like we're just about to get the Sun coming into the lens, so we'll have to move the camera away.
Roger.
We can't see any earthshine or any surface features at all in earthshine now due to the fact that the LM is very bright and is causing our pupils to contract. It's a very fantastic view to see the terminator as you look along the edge of it. I think you'll agree that some of these craters that you're seeing in the picture now are really accentuated by the lengthening of the shadows as they come close to the terminator.
Yes. It's a very beautiful and a rugged sight that we've got on the screen now.
And I think you've got some interesting data on thruster firing versus pitch angle. It looks like that LM just wants to head down towards the surface, is all.
Roger. I have a comment here that says that's what the LM was built for.
I believe!
And as the Moon sinks slowly in the west, Apollo 11 bids good day to you.
Roger. We sort of thought it was the Sun setting in the east.
Well, it depends on your point of view.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. When you're ready to copy, I have an LOI 2 PAD and a TEI 5 PAD. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
I'm passing 182 inertial. I'm going inertial now.
Ready to copy LOI 2 PAD.
Roger on the inertial. And here we go on the LOI 2 PAD. LOI 2, SPS/G&N: 38320, plus 166, minus 081; TIG 080 11 3603. NOUN 81: minus 01408, minus all balls, minus 00743. Roll all balls, 196 359 00657, plus 00537. DELTA-VT 01592 017 01531. Sextant star 23 1160 138. The rest of the PAD is NA. GDC align, Vega and Deneb 243 183 012. Ullage, two jets 19 seconds. Remarks: On your DAP load, we would like an R1 20101 vice the value which appears in the flight plan. In making the sextant star check this must be done between GET of 79 30 10, at which time the star comes above the horizon, and 79 52 10, which is your local sunrise due to the fact that this star's relatively close to the Sun. Your burn orientation is heads down, retrograde pitched up 28 degrees with respect to local horizontal. The calculated values for NOUN 42 are HA 65.6 and HP 54.6. Both of those being plus. Read back. Over.
Roger, LOI 2: SPS/G&N: 38320, plus 166, minus 081 080 11 3603, minus 01408, minus all balls, minus 00743, all zeros, 196 359 00657, plus 00537, 01592 017 01531 23 1160 138. Vega, Deneb 243 183 012, two jet 19 seconds, DAP, R1 20101. Sextant star between 79 30 10 and 79 52 10. Attitude is heads down, retrograde pitched up 28 degrees. HA after the burn - Was that NOUN 42 for HA and 64.6 and HP 54.6? Over.
Roger. On the NOUN 42 value, the last stuff you gave, HA is 65.6, HP is 54.6. Otherwise, I readback correct. I'm standing by with your TEI 5 PAD. Over.
Roger. HA 65.6 for NOUN 42. And ready to copy.
11, this is Houston. TEI 5 SPS/G&N: 37201, minus 060, plus 047; TIG 086 09 3666. NOUN 81: plus 33521, plus 03441, minus 01458; roll NA, pitch 032. The rest of the PAD is NA. Ullage two jet, 16 seconds undocked. Over.
Roger. TEI 5 SPS/G&N: 37201, minus 060, plus 047 086 09 3666, plus 33521, plus 03441, minus 0145 458, NA, 032. The rest is NA. Two jet, 16 seconds, undocked. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Readback is correct. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston.
Houston, you want us back on downvoice backup? Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. That's affirmative on the downvoice backup. We'd like you to confirm your UPTELEMETRY switch in the NORMAL position. Over.
Roger. It's in BLOCK. Did you get us the - You got us a new CSM state vector and an LOI 2 target load in between all that television, didn't you?
That's affirmative.
Thank you.
And what I'm asking for is the switchover to - -
The UPTELEMETRY switch is in NORMAL. Over.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. During the LOI 1 burn, your engine burned a little bit more propellant than we predicted, and consequently, we'd like to update - or send you a new TEI 4 PAD. Over.
Okay.
Our chamber pressure onboard was higher that time, too. It's all on the onboard tape, the time entry, and the chamber pressure; but to make a long story short, it worked its way up to 100.
Roger.
And down here, we showed a chamber pressure of on the order of 103 to 104 psi during your burn on playback.
Okay.
Go ahead with the TEI 4.
Roger. TEI 4 revised: SPS/G&N: 38320, minus 055, plus 060 084 30 2749, plus 31380, plus 03475, minus 01032; roll NA, pitch 034. Rest of the PAD is NA. Ullage two jets 16 seconds, undocked. No LOI 2. Over.
Just in TEI 4 SPS/G&N: 38320, minus 055, plus 060 084 30 2749, plus 31380, plus 03475, minus 01032, NA, 034. All the rest of the PAD's NA. Two jets, 16 seconds, undocked. No LOI 2.
11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We've been looking at your systems data on playback, and everything is looking good. In particular, the SPS looks good. I would like to remind you, though, of a request to perform this burn on the bank A ball valves only, and you are GO for LOI 2. Also, we have currently in the flight plan, you scheduled tomorrow to start entering the LM at about 96 hours GET, and we'd like to know if you have any plans to initiate this ingress into the LM earlier. If so, we can call the people in ahead of time. Over.
Well, we didn't have any plans to. No. We just wanted to be ready at that time.
Roger. We just wanted to make sure that we were ready when you were ready. Over.
Okay. And to get the sextant star in LOI 2, that's roll zero. Is that affirmative?
That's affirmative. Roll zero.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. Five minutes until LOS. And with respect to your request for the nitrogen bottle pressures preburn, just before the burn, we were showing 2270 pounds per square inch on bottle Alfa and 2350 on bottle Bravo. Over.
Apollo 11. Roger. Thank you.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Two minutes to LOS. Your AOS on the other side is 80 33 21, and the friendly White Team will see you when you come out from behind the Moon.
Apollo 11. Roger.
Thank you, Bruce.
Make that your friendly "Greens". Your friendly White Team CAP COMM will see you when you come out from behind the Moon. I think it's basically the Maroon Team here, and we "Greenies" are leaving.
Okay. I don't blame you, Hank.
Roger. I'd rather be up there.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by. Over.
VGY minus 0.0, VGZ minus 0.1, DELTA-VC minus 5.2, fuel 362, OX 364, unbalance plus 50, and our postburn now 94's, 66.1 by 54.4. Go ahead.
Roger. We copy, Neil. Would you say again the DELTA-VZ? We missed that. Over.
Roger. That was minus 0.1.
Roger. Copy the burn report. Sounds good.
And all looked good up here.
Apollo 11, Houston. We missed your DELTA-TIG and also your DELTA burn time. Over.
DELTA-TIG was zero and the burn time was 17 seconds.
Copy 17.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'll be satisfied if you pump up the cabin to 5.4. Over.
Okay. We're showing about 5.2 right now.
Roger.
And, Charlie, the LM/CM DELTA-P is just over 1 pound right now.
Copy. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. If you read, please attempt to acquire on the high gain. We're having trouble locking up on the TM and we have no voice. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11, Apollo 11.
Roger.
Roger. We're reading you five by. Go ahead. Over.
Roger. We have you on high gain now.
Roger. We lost the TM and the voice for about 5 minutes here. We attempted a handover and fouled it up in some manner, but we got you back now. Thank you much.
Okay. We're pressurizing the LM at this time.
Copy.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We have a P22 AUTO optics update for you if you're ready to copy. Over.
Ready to copy.
Roger, Mike. It's landmark Alfa 1: T1, 82 37 35; T2, 82 42 50. We're 7 miles north. Over.
Copy. P22: T1, time 82 37 35; T2, 82 42 50. And the target is 7 miles north. Thank you.
Roger.
I get the distinct impression, Charlie, that mare there laps up over the edge of the mountains at the shorelines.
Roger. We copy.
Houston. On your comment about the mare lapping up to the terrain - mountainous terrain, is that an impression like a lava flow coming in around a prominence, Neil, or is it more -looks like it's sloping up at that point? Over.
It isn't true everywhere, but there's certainly places where there seems to be a slope downward towards the shoreline on the mare. In other words, from the mare down to the shoreline is a downward slope indicating that it might be a lava flow.
Roger.
Crossing Duke Island and Maskelyne W.
Say again, Neil. Over.
We just crossed Duke Island and Maskelyne W.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're wondering if you've started into the LM yet. Over.
We have the CSM hatch out, the drogue and probe removed and stowed, and we're just about ready to open the LM hatch now.
Roger. Thank you much, Neil. We'll be standing by.
Okay, Charlie. We're in the LM. The docking index mark is the same.
Roger. We copy.
Charlie, apparently there just doesn't seem to be any slow way to get that REPRESS to AUTO without making a big bang.
Apollo 11, Houston. Say again. Over.
Roger. There just doesn't seem to be any slow way to get the REPRESS closed to AUTO and avoid a big bang. Over.
We copy, Buzz. Thank you much. Out.
We concur with that, Buzz.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'll have LOS 81 45, next AOS - Stand by.
Next AOS 82 32. Over.
Okay. 82 32.
Houston, Apollo 11. I am going to start a maneuver to P22 attitude at this time.
11. Roger. We copy. Over.
Okay. We're noticing some water inside the command module for the first time. There's a little puddle of it on the aft bulkhead sort of like 101 had.
Roger.
I'd like to know how EECOMM wants to get rid of it. There are a number of different ways and what does he think is the best one?
We'll be with you in a moment, Mike. Stand by.
No big rush. It will wait until the next REV or two.
All right.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've played back the LOI 2 burn. It looks really good to us. The systems were all good. We got an orbit on the limited amount of tracking at 65.4 by a 53.9. Over.
Sounds good, Houston.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by. Out.
Okay, Houston. We'll be done with P22 in just a couple of minutes.
Roger. We copy all that. You're looking good.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead.
Roger. You copy that NOUN 49 on your downlink? If you've had enough time, I'll proceed.
We got it. Go ahead, Mike.
Apollo 11, Houston. We see a NOUN 89. You can do the VERB 34 now. Over. Beat me to it.
Yes. I've done it, Charlie.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
All that procedure for P22 seemed to work very well. The only thing that was a little odd, is that there was some DAP thruster activity. I had pitch in ACCEL COMMAND, and roll and yaw in RATE COMMAND, and somehow, roll and yaw got excited and the DAP went into a flurry of thruster firing. We've noticed the same thing in the CMS, and just written it off as a CMS peculiarity.
Roger. We saw that activity, Mike. We'll see if we can track it down and let you know. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. You can proceed to sleep attitude now. Over.
That's in work, Houston.
Okay.
Houston, we're holding inertial a little while to study the approach to the landing zone.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo ... in the Eagle - Apollo 11 in the Eagle. I've got ... for our landing area.
Apollo 11, Houston. You are breaking up badly. Say again. Over.
Roger. I can see the entire landing area from the position I'm in looking out the left window in the LM.
Roger, Buzz. Understand you can see the entire landing area looking out the LM windows. Over.
That's right.
...
Apollo 11, Houston. Say again. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. We got a lot of noise on the downlink. Would you please try your high gain in wide beamwidth, and the angles are 180 the yaw and pitch zero. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read us on the high gain? Over.
Roger, Mike. You're a lot better now. Over.
Okay. You want a wide beam for some reason?
That's affirmative. We got you in the shadows, though. You are looking right down along the engine bell towards the Earth so we need you in wide beam. Over.
Okay. Fine. We're starting our maneuvers to sleep attitude. Roll 82, pitch 229, yaw zero.
Roger. The angles you got in the flight plan will he good when you get there.
Houston, 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Okay. We are on page activation 12 and 13, step 4, and verify descent talkbacks gray, and they're barberpole.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. We would like you to take the low voltage taps OFF; RESET, then ON. Over.
Stand by. We got it. We just had one circuit breaker out of position.
Okay.
We have them gray now.
Roger.
... should have warmed up by now.
Oh, he's transmitting on B.
Hey, Mike, you transmitting on B?
Houston, Apollo 11 - Apollo 11/Eagle. Over.
Roger, Eagle. This is Houston. We read you. Over.
Roger. I read you about four by four. Could you give me a short count, please?
Roger, Eagle. Coming in with the short count - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Houston out. Over.
Roger. Are you copying my low bit rate? Over.
Roger. We got some beautiful data here, Eagle. We're - All those guys are looking at it - systems guys. We'll have some word for you in a minute how everything looks.
Roger. I'm all ready to switch to high bit rate if that's okay with you.
Would you please stand by, Eagle. We want to get to the proper sleep attitude before we proceed on with the COMM check. Over.
Standing by.
Houston, Eagle. We'll go ahead with the camera checkout. I'm still on low taps, and I assume there's no problem doing that. Over.
Stand by.
That's affirmative. No problem on that, Eagle. You can go ahead and power up the sequence camera. Over.
Should have done that before.
Eagle, be advised - sounds like a hot mike. Over.
Right. Yes.
Roger. If you're reading me now, I am in hot mike because I'm in ICS push to talk, and DOWNVOICE BACKUP. Over.
Roger. We just wanted to remind you. Over.
Thank you.
Columbia, this is Houston. Are you maneuvering to sleep attitude? Over.
Eagle, this is Houston. We have lost all the voice and data with Columbia. Would you see if he is maneuvering to sleep attitude? Over.
Hey, Mike. You maneuvering to sleep attitude?
...
I don't believe they can hear you, Mike. Are you maneuvering now to sleep attitude?
...
Houston, Eagle. The Columbia has maneuvered to sleep attitude. He's got the high gain antennas - antenna angles set in, and he should be communicating with you. Over.
Roger. We don't have him. Stand by.
Eagle, Houston. Would you please have Columbia put in COMMAND RESET? Over.
Wilco. COMMAND RESET.
Eagle, Houston. Since we're in sleep attitude, I'll give you another long count. If you're reading in this mode, we'd like you to switch to high bit rate. Over.
Roger. Go ahead with your short count.
Roger. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. We're reading you five by. You can go to high bit rate now. Over.
Roger. Going to high bit rate now.
Eagle, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston, this is Eagle. Roger. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Roger. Reading you five by also, Buzz, and we got the high bit rate. It's looking beautiful through Goldstone. Giving you a count: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Please give us a count. Over.
Roger, Houston. Eagle with a count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Over.
Roger. Stand by. We're reading you five by. Over.
Okay. I'm ready to go S band voice. Over.
Stand by, Eagle. Stand by on step 4.
Columbia, this is Houston. Would you please give us P00 in ACCEPT. We've got a load for you. Break. Eagle, we're ready to go to step 4. Please select S band voice to VOICE. Over.
Hello, Eagle. This is Houston. How do you read - normal voice? Over.
Eagle - Houston, this is Eagle. Read you loud and clear on S band, normal voice. How me? Over.
Roger. You're beautiful in this mode, Buzz. We're reading you five by. Coming with a short count and we'd like one back from you. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Houston out.
Roger. Houston, Eagle. You're gorgeous also. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Eagle, over.
Roger, Eagle. This is better than the downvoice backup. Stand by 1
Eagle, Houston. Everybody's happy as a clam with this mode. We'd like to stay here for a little bit. Telemetry looks great, and the; voice is great. Over.
Roger. Understand. I'm checking out camera number 4 now.
Eagle, Houston. Say again what you're checking out? Over.
Roger, Houston. Eagle has checked out both 70 millimeter cameras and both 16 millimeter cameras, and all work fine. Over.
Sounds great. Stand by.
Eagle, Houston. We've looked over your systems on the high bit rate. Everything looks super; we're ready to go. Over.
Roger. Stand by. You want to go back to low bit rate now?
Stand by on that. Over.
Eagle, Houston. We look good through the 210 on this mode. We're going to shift data select to an 85 foot dish to see what we've got, and then we'll be back to you on the 210. If you'll stand by a couple of minutes in this mode, we'll be back with you. Over.
Roger. Eagle standing by.
Eagle, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Houston, Eagle. Read you loud and clear. Over.
Roger. We're reading you five by. We've got the voice good through the 85; the telemetry is in and out through the 85. Stand by. We'll be back with you through the 210. Over.
Eagle, Houston. You can go step 5 now. We'd like low bit rate. Over.
Houston, Eagle. You have low bit rate.
Roger. Copy, Eagle.
Eagle, Houston. Could you give me a short count - this mode? Over.
Houston, this is Eagle with a short count. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Eagle. Over.
Roger, Eagle. You're five by. This S band voice is really beautiful. Over.
And, Eagle, Houston. We'll be standing by in this mode for a minute or so. We'll be back with you if you'll just stand by. Over.
Roger.
Eagle, this is Houston coming through the 210. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Read you loud and clear.
Eagle, this is Houston. We're happy with all our data in all modes. You can power down the COMM now. Over.
Roger. I understand. Eagle will power down the COMM, and we are just approaching 27 volts now. It looks like we won't have to bother with the high taps.
Right.
We're powering down. Out.
Roger. Copy. Out.
Columbia, this is Houston. We got a TEI 11 PAD for you and an update on the water dump. Over.
Stand by one, Houston. Are you through with the DSKY?
That's affirmative. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Columbia. Ready to copy TEI 11. Over.
Roger, Columbia. Here we come with the TEI 11. SPS G&N: 37200, minus 060, plus 047. NOUN 33, 098 05 2422, plus 41448, plus 03719, minus 02422. Roll is NA, pitch 020, the rest of the PAD is NA. Set stars are NA. The ullage is two quads - correction, two jets for 16 seconds; use Bravo and Delta. In the comments, the undocked present CSM - correction, this is for - TEI 11 is undocked. Present onboard weight of the CSM is 37200 pounds, about 50 Alfa on your DAP. Over.
All right. I read back: TEI 11, SPS G&N: 37200, minus 060, plus 047, plus 098, 05 2422, plus 41448, plus 03719, minus 02422; NA, 020; the rest of the PAD NA. Ullage, two jets for 16 seconds, Quads B and D. Undocked present CSM weight is okay in the DAP.
Roger, 11. And we'd like you to do a waste water dump at 84 hours down to 25 percent. Over.
Roger. I understand. Waste water dump to 25 percent at 84 hours.
Roger. And, Mike, we'll have LOS in about 11 minutes at 83 44. AOS is 84 30, and prior to - or at LOS, we would like you to go - Configure the S band for high gain track to REACQ, high gain beam to NARROW, and let's try that to see if we can get an automatic REACQ at the next AOS. Over.
Good idea.
I'm in REACQ and NARROW now.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Also, that water that you got on the aft bulkhead, we - If it's not too much, we just recommend sopping it up and then throwing the sponges away in the waste stowage area. If it's too much, then we recommend using the procedure in the checklist on page F10-14. Over.
All right. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you have Buzz make sure he gives us the OPS pressure readings before you close up? Over.
Will do.
Houston, 11. The OPS read 5750, both bottles.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
11, Houston. Roger. Reading you fine, and it looks like the automatic REACQ went very well just as soon as you came around the limb. We have several small items to discuss with you here just before you go to sleep. Over.
Go ahead. Over.
Okay, 11. First of all, on our LM systems checks, everything went fine. I would like to remind you, though, tomorrow you may see an ascent pressure light when you activate the MC&W. There should be no problem, however. You did note that the APS AUX tank pressure was only reading 111 psi, which is normal at this point, but below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium which has been dissolved into the propellant. Over.
Roger. Understand that. Thank you.
Roger. And next item, the supercritical helium rise rate is nominal, and you also had that question for us about your thruster activity during the P22 on the last REV. Believe we understand that now, as you reported that your pitch was in ACCEL COMMAND and your yaw and roll were in RATE COMMAND. You were firing your pitch thrusters. This will couple rates into your yaw and roll axes, and the - You were at that time holding only half a degree deadband and coupling rates into yaw and roll produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axes. Over.
Yes. That may be true. It's very peculiar coupling, in that it waits longer than you would think and its reaction is greater than you would think. We were getting yaw rates of around four tenths of a degree per second, for example.
Roger, Mike. We did play the data back, and that's the way it looked upon analysis of the chart recordings back here. Over.
Okay. Fine.
They've also looked at the results of your landmark tracking. The marks all apparently were very good, and we've got a full page of data here relative to the altitudes of the various site locations, which I won't read up to you, but I did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well. I also have your consumable budgets, particularly your RCS propellant quantities. They're Deltas from nominal if you should want them. Your worst quad is quad Charlie, which is 9 percent low. I'll not read up the others unless you want them. Over.
Okay. How about the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge? You want that now?
I'll have to stand by just a moment.
Okay. And then the other one is, we're still charging battery A.
11, Houston. We would like to delay the fuel cell purge until the backside of the Moon, and you go ahead and - should terminate your battery charge at this time. Over.
Okay. Understand. I knew we had another O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> purge coming up in the morning; I wasn't sure whether you wanted to go through with this one or not. I'll wait until the next side and then do it.
That's fine, Buzz.
Terminate battery charging now.
That's right, and one other systems item here - in order to balance your CRYO tanks, would you get your O<sub>2</sub> tank 1 and your H 2 tank 2 heaters off? Over.
Okay. I have O<sub>2</sub> tank heater 1 off, and H<sub>2</sub> tank heater 2 off.
That's right, Mike, and we believe you have your quad Bravo and quad Charlie turned off in your DAP at this time, and a 5 degree deadband. We'd prefer a 10 degree deadband for your sleep period overnight here. Over.
Okay.
One other item relative to a malfunction procedure. It's unlikely that you'll have to worry about this tomorrow, but in your malfunction list under docking on page F11 9, there is a malfunction procedure for a high O<sub>2</sub> flow rate at the top of - under tunnel at the top of page 11 9. We would like to have you not use that malfunction procedure should you encounter the high O<sub>2</sub> flow rate, and instead, check back with Houston for a revised procedure should you find that situation. Over.
Understand, and note has been made in my checklist.
11, Houston. Roger. That just about takes care of all the items we have here on the ground before time to hit the sack, and I guess you will have a presleep check for us before you go to bed.
Roger. We're in the midst of cycling the O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> fans now.
Roger.
And the radiation is as follows: CDR 11012, CMP 10013, LMP 09015. Negative medication. Over.
Roger. Copy, 11.
Houston, Apollo 11.
11, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We're thinking about taking the monocular with us on into the LM. We think it might prove to be of some use. Over.
Roger, Buzz. It sounds like a good idea for some of your surveying work there inside the cockpit. Over.
Okay. You want to run that by with whoever might be concerned?
I sure will.
Apollo 11, Houston. We have apparently lost the high gain lock. We would appreciate it if you would give us a help manually to try to relock up on the high gain. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. ..
11, Houston. Reading you very weak, still too far down in the noise to complete the full transmission. If you'd give us a hand on a manual relock, we'd appreciate it.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're still unable to pick you up on the high gain antenna. Request you go to MANUAL, and wide beamwidth. The pitch and yaw angles in your checklist are good ones. You should be able to find us there. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read now?
11, Houston. Loud and clear this time. How me?
Loud and clear. You faded out on your last transmission. Over.
Roger. Are you in wide beam now?
Negative. I got you locked back on again REACQ and narrow.
Roger. That's all we want. We want to stay in narrow, and we're a little puzzled about why we lost you here a few minutes ago. Do you have any ideas?
No, we sure don't (cough) - sure don't. We're showing - we're showing about 15 degrees plus pitch and about 270. That ought to be good and clear.
We concur there. We still don't have any good ideas on why we were lost then.
11, Houston. Would you confirm that we did acquire automatically when you came around the limb for this passage. Over.
That's confirmed.
Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11.
11, Houston. On your AUTO RCS SELECT switches, we show quad Bravo disabled but quad Charlie only partially disabled. Charlie 3, I believe, is the only one you have selected off. Is that correct?
Yes. Roger. That's correct.
Roger.
How do they look to you now, Houston?
11, Houston. We see them all disabled at this time. Thank you.
Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, Houston. We're going to try to check out this ability to automatically reacquire on the S band, and what we want to do is to secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds. Then we will turn it back on and see if the spacecraft equipment will automatically reacquire. So if you do not get a call from us within about 3 minutes, that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance on a manual acquisition. Over.
Okay. We understand.
11, Houston. We also would appreciate - if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire. Over.
Roger. We'll do that.
11, Houston. It looks like we're locked back up again with no delay. How does it look on board? Over.
Roger. The signal strength dropped very rapidly to zero; and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 seconds, moved toward 40 degrees pitch and 240 degrees yaw. Right now, they're sitting on about 15 degrees pitch and about 265 degrees yaw. So they didn't move very far, about 30 degrees apiece; and then they picked right back on up again. Over.
Roger. Some of "The Luckiest People" in the background there. We copied your pitch and yaw angles.
11, Houston. Could you give us the location of your - pitch and yaw location of your position indicators? Over.
Roger. They're in the same position as the antenna right now; plus 15 degrees pitch and - no, now wait a minute. I got them - got it at about 275 instead of 265.
Okay. Thank you.
11, Houston. We'd like to try the same procedure once more. We'll leave the carrier a little longer and be back up for a call within 4 minutes. Over.
Okay.
11, Houston. We're locked back up again. Can you give us a report on how the antenna behaved?
Roger. It was essentially identical as before. The pitch went to 45, 40 to 45 and the yaw went to about - to about 255, 245 to 255; and then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw. Over.
11, Houston. Roger. Your angles are 45 and 255. Do I understand that as soon as the carrier dropped, it went to these angles; or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was reenabled and the antenna began to reacquire? Over.
No. As soon as the carrier dropped off, why, it drifted over into those angles and stayed there. Then when it came back up again, why, it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off. Gradually brought it on in to the angles where it is right now; and then the signal strength would take several jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. Over.
11, Houston. Understand. And on another subject, request you zero your optics for the night. Over.
Roger. Zeroed.
Apollo 11, Houston. Can you confirm that you have changed the CO<sub>2</sub> filter as per flight plan in the last hour? Over?
No. We're still eating. We're about to do it. We'll let you know.
Roger, 11. And we've got about 14 minutes until LOS. AOS is 86 30, an hour away. We're wondering whether or not you plan to have one man up at that time or would you all like to be asleep inside the next hour? Over.
Somebody will be up.
Roger. The thing that we're still puzzling on is the antenna, and if - as long as there will be somebody up, why, we would like to have somebody check the automatic REACQ on the next AOS.
Okay. We'll do that. We haven't chlorinated the water yet, and we haven't changed the lithium hydroxide. We're just still finishing up dinner.
Roger, Mike. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. We have LOS coming up in 2 minutes now, and AOS will be at 86 plus 28 plus 15. Over.
We'll see you on the other side, Houston.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
11, Houston. Loud and clear here. Over.
Okay. We just appeared to get a solid lock for the last - oh, about a minute. The ... needle's been wandering up and down, and the pitch and yaw needles have been wandering around, but it appears to have reacquired by itself solidly now. We're just finishing up our fuel cell purge. Hydrogen on number 3 is the last to go off. It'll be coming off in just a second.
Roger, 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. We believe we've tracked down the reacquisition problem we had on the previous REV. It looks like it was a receiver power supply here on the ground and no problems in the spacecraft at all. Over.
Okay. Glad to hear it.
11, that really winds things up as far as we're concerned on the ground, for the evening. We're ready to go to bed and get a little sleep. Over.
Yes. We're about to join you.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11. Good morning from the Black Team.
Good morning, Houston.
Good morning. We got about 2 minutes to LOS here, Mike.
... You guys wake up early.
(Laughing) Yes, you're about 2 minutes early on the wakeup. Looks like you were really sawing them away.
You're right.
11, Houston. For planning purposes, you can go ahead and take the monocular into the LM with you.
Okay. I'll tell them. How are all the CSM systems looking?
11, Houston. Looks like the command module's in good shape. Black Team has been watching it real closely for you.
We sure appreciate that. Because I sure haven't.
Say again.
I say because I sure have not.
Roger.
Apollo 11. Thirty seconds. AOS will be 94 plus 21.
94 21.
Apollo 11, Houston. Standing by.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. Go.
Roger. How do you read the BIOMED in the LMP with the LCG on? Over.
Roger. Stand by, 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. We have good data on all 3 crewmen. No. Belay that. The Commander we do not have yet.
Okay. He's not up yet.
Houston, Apollo 11. We just had a very good view of the landing site. We can pick out almost all of the features we've identified previously.
11, Houston. Roger. Sounds real fine. And, 11, I have your maneuver PAD and consumables update whenever you want them.
Stand by.
Stand by a little, please.
Roger. We're standing by. And that's the block data on the maneuver PAD, by the way.
Houston, Apollo 11 is a couple of minutes away from this rolling right 40 degrees to roll 122, pitch 229, yaw 0. Over.

Okay. Thank you. And on board, we're reading for quad Alfa 75 percent, Bravo 78, Charlie 78, and Delta 77 percent.
11, Houston. We copy.
Apollo 11, Houston. I have your base line altitude update now, if Buzz is ready to copy.
...
Go ahead.
Roger. Alfa 1 is 500, that's 500 feet above the landing site. Over.
Okay. Alfa 1 is 500 feet above the landing site. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11. Our crew status report for sleep: CDR 5.5, CMP 6.0, LMP 5.0. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. We have that now.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead.
Roger. The "Black Bugle" just arrived with some morning news briefs if you're ready.
Go ahead.
Roger.
...
Okay. Church services around the world today are mentioning Apollo 11 in their prayers. President Nixon's worship service at the White House is also dedicated to the mission, and our fellow astronaut, Frank Borman, is still in there pitching and will read the passage from Genesis which was read on Apollo 8 last Christmas. The Cabinet and members of Congress, with emphasis on the Senate and House space committees, have been invited, along with a number of other guests. Buzz, your son, Andy, got a tour of MSC yesterday. Your Uncle Bob Moon accompanied him on the visit which included the LRL. Among the - -
- - Thank you.
Roger. Among the large headlines concerning Apollo this morning, there's one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit. An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called Chang-o has been living there for 4000 years. It seems she was banished to the Moon because she stole the pill of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in the shade of a cinnamon tree. The name of the rabbit is not reported.
Okay. We'll keep a close eye out for the bunny girl.
Roger. You residents of the spacecraft Columbia may be interested in knowing that today is Independence Day in the country of Colombia. Gloria Diaz of the Philippines was crowned Miss Universe last night. She defeated 60 other girls for the global beauty title. Miss Diaz is 18, with black hair and eyes, and measures 34-1/2, 23, 34-1/2. First runner up was Miss Australia, followed by Miss Israel, and Miss Japan. While you're on your way back Tuesday night, the American and National League Allstars will be playing ball in Washington. Mel Stottlemyre of the Yankees is expected to be the American League's first pitcher. No one is predicting who will be first pitcher for the National League yet. They have nine on the roster. Even though research has certainly paid off in the space program, research doesn't always pay off, it seems. The Woodstream Corporation, parent company of the Animal Trap Company of America which has made more than a billion wooden spring mousetraps, reports that it built a better mousetrap but the world didn't beat a door to its path - didn't beat a path to its door. As a matter of fact, the company had to go back to the old-fashioned kind. They said, "We should have spent more time researching housewives and less time researching mice". And the "Black Beag - Bugle" is all completed for the morning.
Thank you very much. We appreciate the news.
Black Team, we'll be looking for an interesting day with you all tomorrow.
Roger. We'll be going off here shortly, and we'll pick you up in the morning for sure.
Apollo 11, Houston. Three minutes to LOS; AOS at 96 plus 20.
Apollo 11. 96 20. Thank you.
Hello, Columbia. Houston. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Houston, this is Eagle. How do you read? Over.
Eagle, this is Houston. Are you calling? Over.
Roger. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Reading you about three by, Buzz; a lot of noise on the loop. We think it's coming from Columbia, but we can't tell. We're unable to raise voice with him. Would he please go to high gain. Over.
Okay. I'll have him go to high gain. It's probably the glycol pump you hear in the background, and I'm up to the point where I turn on the IMU. Would you recommend I hold off here for a few minutes or go ahead and power up the IMU? Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Hey, get your high gain to working.
Houston.
Eagle, this is Houston. You can turn on the IMU. Over.
...
Houston, this is Columbia.
Columbia, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston ...
Hello, Eagle. This is Houston. We've got a noisy downlink on the downvoice backup. Would you please select S band voice to VOICE? Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
Roger. About three by, Mike. We've got a lot of noise in the background. It's clearing up now. Break. Eagle, Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston, Eagle. About four by four. Go ahead.
Roger. Just getting a voice check. Say the page you're on in the activation checklist. Over.
Roger. I'm on page 27. Over.
Roger. Understand 27. We copy. Out.
Columbia, this is Houston. Would you please give us P00 in ACCEPT. We have a state vector for you. Over.
Stand by one.
Houston, Columbia. You have P00 in ACCEPT, and how are you reading me now?
Roger. Understand, we have P00 in ACCEPT. You're about three by in - on the voice, Mike. Over.
Okay. You're coming in loud and clear, and I'm configured for normal voice. If you've got any switch changes, let me know.
Roger. We've got some noise somewhere in the system down here, I think. We're working on it. And I've got a 130 landmark update for you, and also a DAP load whenever you're ready to copy. Over.
Stand by one.
Go ahead with the 130 update.
Roger, Mike. Coming at you with the 130, P1 is 98 37 35, P2 98 42 44, 4 miles north. Over.
Okay. P1 98 37 35, P2 98 42 44, 4 miles north of track; and go ahead with your DAP load.

36651, 33627, minus 0.72, plus 0.51. Over.
Both are good readbacks. Out.
Houston, Eagle. Are you satisfied with the LGC self test? Over.
Roger. Understand. You passed the LGC self test. Over.
Negative. I was asking you if you were satisfied with it. As far as I can tell, it's satisfactory. And also the primary EVAP flow is actuated to number 1 at 96 05. Over.
Roger. Copy on the primary EVAP. We've got the low bit rate, Buzz. We couldn't see that LGC self test. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Columbia. The docking tunnel index angle remains unchanged.
Roger. Copy. Out.
Houston, Eagle is going to secondary transmitter/receiver and secondary power amplifier, and I'll check with you in 60 seconds. Over.
Roger. Stand by. We're standing by. Over.
Okay.
Columbia, Houston. We are through with the computer. You can go back to BLOCK. Over.
Houston, Eagle. On secondary transmitter/receiver and power amplifier, how do you read? Over. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Over.
Roger. Reading you five by, Buzz. How me? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Out.
Roger. That's about the same as before. Switching back to PRIMARY.
Roger.
Houston, Eagle. Back on PRIMARY, and I'm ready to proceed with the steerable antenna activation.
Roger. We're standing by, Buzz. Go ahead. Over.
And I'll go to BIOMED left - right momentarily.
Roger.
Houston, Eagle. Got a real nice lock on - lockon on the steerable antenna, and you should be receiving BIOMED right and PCM high. Over.
Roger, Eagle. We got you five by. It's really beautiful. We've got the high bit rate and the BIOMED. Out.
Eagle, Houston. Do you copy? Over.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Eagle. For your information, we're doing the glycol pump check now.
Roger. Copy.
And there's the secondary glycol pump.
Roger.
And I'm on secondary, or number 2 pump right now, and I'll hold here for a couple of seconds and then switch back to number 1.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Houston.
Roger, Columbia. We noticed your DAP configuration. We'd like you to turn off B3 and C4, Mike, and for register 2 in the DAP, we'd like all ones. Over.
B3 and C4 are both off on panel 8 and I understand you want - Say again what you want on register 2.
Roger. In the DAP, we'd like you load all ones. Over.
All right.
Columbia, Houston. Did you hit the COMMAND RESET around - after LOS on the last pass? Over.
That's affirmative. When we were having difficulty getting you, Charlie, I pushed the COMMAND RESET to make sure I had control of high gain.
Roger. Thank you much. We're in good shape now. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Eagle. Can you tell me if you're picking up BIOMED on the CDR now? Over.
Stand by.
Eagle, Houston. We're not getting any BIOMED from the CDR now. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Eagle, Houston. We got the BIOMED on the commander now. Over.
Very good. Thank you.
Houston, Eagle. We're ready for an E memory dump if you are. Over.
Roger. We're ready. Go.
Eagle, this is Houston. We see the optics zero switch on. Before you take some marks, don't forget to cycle it back off and on, and then on. Over.
Roger. Houston, Eagle here. I wish we had one of those optics. I'll tell Mike about it.
Roger, Columbia. Excuse me. Sorry about that.
Eagle, Houston. Could you give us a hack on the time that you switched to LM power and also verify that we're on glycol pump 1. Over.
This is Eagle. We're on pump 1, stand by for the switchover time.
Roger.
The switch time to LM power is 95 54 00. Over.
Roger. Copy, Neil. Is Buzz back in the Columbia now? Over.
Yes. He is.
Roger. Thank you.
Hello, Columbia, this is Eagle on Simplex B. How do you read?
You are loud and clear in Simplex B, Neil.
Roger. Read you loud and clear.
Okay. Would you configure for Simplex A, please?
Roger. Going to Simplex A.
Columbia, Eagle. How do you read on VHF A?
Reading you loud and clear on A.
Roger. Read you loud and clear.
And I'm ready to get a time hack from you. Load the CSM time.
Okay.
Do you want the T-EPHEM first?
Let's get your clock first and then we'll get T-EPHEM.
Okay.
Give me a time for load.
97 01 30. Correction on that, Neil. 97 - make that 97 03 30.
Okay. I have 97 03 30 set in.
Okay. And you've got about a minute to go.
Okay.
15 seconds to go. 10. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

MARK it.
97 03 30.
Got it.
Okay. Let's do a 0665 on my Mark.
Did you get that, Mike?
Standing by for your Mark.
Okay, 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Okay. 97 04 03.86.
Okay. I'm within three hundredths. That's within our ability to keep together, I think.
Roger.
Okay. Now you want to give me T-EPHEM VERB 05, NOUN 01 ENTER?
Okay. I've got VERB 05, NOUN 01, ENTER. Going to 17 06 ENTER.
Roger.
Are you ready to copy?
Go ahead.
Roger. Register 1, 5 balls; register 2, 20017; register 3, 20616. Over.
Understand R1, 5 zeros; R2, 20017; R3, 20616.
That's correct.
And I'm standing by configured to record your PCM data.
And I'm ready to start on a docked IMU coarse align when you are; and when you're ready, go MIN deadband ATT hold.
Okay. Stand by.
We're minimum deadband, attitude hold.
Okay. Now I need your NOUN 20.
Okay. I got VERB 06, NOUN 20. Give me a Mark on it.
Okay.

Register 1, plus 11202, plus 20741, plus 00211. Over.
Copy. 11202, 20741, 00211.
That's correct.
Eagle, Houston. That coarse align looked good to us. Over.
Roger.
Okay, Mike. Your attitude hold's no longer required.
Thank you.
Okay, Mike. I'd like to copy a NOUN 20 again, 06 NOUN 20. Be on my Mark.
Standing by for your Mark.
3, 2, 1; stand by. Take it again.
Okay.
3, 2, 1.

That's correct.
Eagle, Houston. I -
Okay, Houston. Did you copy -
Eagle, Houston. We have the angles. I'll read them back. Over. For the command module, 11154, 20792, 00230. For the LM, 18995, 02852, 35863. Over.
That's correct for Eagle and command module.
Roger.
Did you get the time? Was 97 14 20.
Roger. Copy, Eagle. Out.
Columbia and Eagle: LOS for both spacecrafts 97 32, AOS 98 18. Houston, out.
Eagle,Houston. We have your gyro torquing angles if you're ready to copy. Over.
Roger. We're ready to copy.
Roger. Eagle. For X minus 00060, Y plus 00620, Z plus 01080. Over.
Understand. X minus 00060, Y plus 00620, Z plus 01080.
Roger, Eagle. Good readback. Out.
Houston, this is Eagle. Do you want us to go ahead and do a VERB 42 at this time?
Stand by. That's affirmative, Eagle. We'd like you to go ahead and fine align. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Eagle, LMP. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Five by, Buzz. How me? Over.
Loud and clear. I'm going to be going through an ascent battery check. You want to check my BIOMED's briefly? Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Eagle, Houston. We got a good BIOMED on you, Buzz. Over.
Okay. Let me know where it ought to be at this point.
Roger. You can stay there at that point. When we go LOS, we'd like you to go off on the BIOMED. Over.
Roger.
Do you copy those angles, Houston - torquing angles?
Roger. They're correct. You can torque. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. We have about 4 minutes LOS. That makes AOS 98 18. Over.
Eagle. Roger.
Columbia. Roger.
Eagle, Columbia.
Columbia, Eagle. Go ahead.
Roger. The capture latch is in the probe or engaged in the drogue. Would you like to set them from your side?
Roger. Stand by.
Houston, Eagle. ED battery A is 37.0 and battery B is 36.9. Over.
Roger. Copy both of those, Buzz. Out.
Eagle, Houston. We looked at the E memory. It's GO. Over.
Roger. E memory GO.
Mike, the capture latches look good.
Thank you.
Eagle, Houston. We'd like you to go to the OMNI antenna, and next AOS, we'd like you to be in forward. Over.
Roger. Going to - which OMNI do you want now, aft?
Eagle, Houston. We'd like aft now and forward at AOS. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Thirty seconds to LOS. Both spacecraft looking good going over the hill. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're standing by. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Do you read? Over.
Eagle, Houston. Do you read? Over.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Eagle, Houston. No voice. Will you verify forward OMNI? Over.
Columbia, Houston. We have no voice with Eagle. Would you please verify that Eagle is on forward OMNI. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Eagle, Houston. Over.
Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.
Roger. Are you reading me, Buzz? Over.
Roger. I've got you now. I fed in those angles for the S band but I couldn't get a lockon because the antenna would be looking through the LM in order to reach the Earth. Over.
Roger. We copied in the P22 attitude that you will not be able to get a high gain lockon. We have a DAP data load, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay. LM weight 33627, CSM weight 36651, pitch trim 00470, roll trim 00589. Over.
Roger. LM weight 33627, CSM weight 36651, pitch trim 00470, roll trim 00589. Over.
Roger, Buzz. That's a good readback. You're about two by with these OMNI's in this configuration; we won't have very good COMM until we get through with the P22. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Eagle, Houston. Would you select S band voice to VOICE. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Downvoice backup. Do you read?
Roger. We read you. Columbia, did you call? Over.
Affirmative. Downvoice backup. How do you read me?
Roger. Better, Mike. We're reading you now about four by. No voice at all with you earlier. Let's stay in this configuration. Eagle, are you in VOICE mode? Over.
Roger. Eagle is in VOICE mode. How do you read? Over.
Roger. You're about three by now, Buzz. We're satisfied with this COMM configuration. Let's stay with where we are. Over.
Houston, Columbia is in OMNI Charlie downvoice backup, and if you get a chance, would you look up the coordinates of 130 for me, please? I have been - conflicting information between my cue card and my flight plan. I'd like to know which coordinate values you want me to use.
Roger. Stand by.
Houston, Eagle. Completed gear extension okay.
Columbia, Houston. We're satisfied with what you already have loaded in P22 for these coordinates. Over.
Thank you, Houston.
Columbia, Houston. The coordinates you have loaded in P22 are - we have - are Site 130 prime. Do you concur? Over.
I have the coordinates loaded on the cue card which are for crater 130.
Columbia, Houston. We made an error on those coordinates. We'd like you to load for latitude in a NOUN 89 plus 01 243, longitude over 2 plus 11 844, altitude minus 001 46 as shown in the flight plan. Over.
Okay, Houston.
Eagle, Houston. Could you give us an idea where you are in the activation? Over.
Roger. We're just sitting around waiting for something to do. We need a state vector, a REFSMMAT, a reading on the AGS. And we need you to watch our DAP load, give a voice check, and throttle check. Over.
Roger. Eagle, we'll have the state vectors and the REFSMMAT as soon as we get the high gain. Over. It will be about another 10 minutes or so before we get through the P22, and when we maneuver to attitude and get the high gain, we'll have the updates for you. Over.
Roger. We'll go ahead with the DAP and throttle ... check if you don't have the gimble drive check, okay?
Roger. Understand you're going to the DAP throttle check. That's affirmative.
Houston, Columbia. These T1 and T2 times are still good, aren't they?
Say again. Over.
I say the T1 and T2 times remain unchanged, don't they?
That's affirmative. Over.
Thank you.
Houston, Eagle.
Go ahead, Eagle. Over.
Roger. In the first of - on page 47, step 1, we had the guidance control in PGNS and mode control PGNS AUTO and, of course, the circuit breakers are not in on the thrusters yet. So when we started through the DAP and proceeded on NOUN 46 - and we're looking at NOUN 47 now, so we've got an RCS TTA light and we've got four out of the eight other bright colored red flags. I think that this is explained by the fact that we are in PGNS and AUTO and unable to fire the thrusters.
Roger. Stand by.
Eagle, Houston. You are correct. The lights are there and the flags because we haven't closed the breakers yet. Over.
Roger.
And Houston, Eagle. Are you going to use the high gain before you can look at our GDA position indicator?
Stand by.
Eagle, Houston. We can see all the throttle data - -
I can give high ...
Go ahead. Over.
I could give you high bit rate on the OMNI if that would help any.
Negative. We have all the throttle data we need. You can stay low bit rate. You can proceed through the throttle test, but do not do the gimbal trim. Over. Repeat, do not do the gimbal trim.
Roger. Understand.
Boy, you just can't miss those check points, Diamondback and Sidewinder.
AUTO optics are pointed just a little bit north of crater 130.
Roger. Copy, Columbia, Out.
...
Houston, Eagle. We are ready to pressurize the RCS. Over.
Stand by.
Eagle, Houston. You can go ahead with your RCS pressurization, but we would like to hold off on RCS checkout until we get the high bit rate. Over.
Roger.
And Eagle, Houston. Have you deployed the landing gear yet? Over.
That's affirmative. The landing gear is out and ...
Roger.
Houston, Columbia. I've completed my marks. I've gone ACCEL COMMAND in all three axes to prevent that thruster firing that last time.
Roger.
Houston, Columbia. Say again on the necessary data on the downlink. Let me know and I'll proceed.
Columbia, stand by on the NOUN 49. Over.
Standing by, Houston.
Columbia, Houston. We got your NOUN 49; you can proceed. Over.
Roger.
Colum - correction, Eagle, Houston. We see the MASTER ARM, you can go ahead and press. We see the press now. Over.
Roger. Looks good.
Roger, Buzz. If you've got - would like, I've got your AGS abort constants. Over.
Ready to copy.
Roger. For your AGS address 224, plus 60267; 225, plus 58148; 226, plus 70312; 227, minus 50031. Over.
Roger. 224, plus 60267; 225, plus 58148; 226, plus 70312; 227, minus 50031. Over.
Roger. Good readback. Out.
Eagle, Columbia. My P22 is complete. I'm continuing this maneuver to AGS CAL attitude.
Roger. Fine. We copy.
Roger.
Eagle, Columbia. Your high gain angles are - Corrected - Eagle, Houston. Your high gain angles are 165 pitch, yaw 66. Over.
Roger. ...
Stand by about another ...
Houston, Eagle. I think I've got you on the high gain antenna now. AGS are go.
Columbia, Houston. If you go to REACQ on the high gain, we can acquire you now. Over.
Eagle, Houston. We got some loads for you if you'll give us P00 and DATA. Over.
You've got P00 and DATA.
Roger. We've got both of you on the high gains now. It sounds great now. Over.
Copy. Roger.
Columbia, Houston. I have a SEP PAD if you're ready to copy. Over.
Stand by one.
Ready to copy.
Roger, Mike. SEP PAD, RCS/G&N: NOUN 47 and NOUN 48 are NA, NOUN 33, 100 395 000, NOUN 81 is NA, roll 000 007 000. Rest of PAD is NA.
SEP, RCS/G&N at a TIG of 100 39 50: roll 0, pitch 007, yaw 0. Over.
Roger. Good readback.
Houston, Eagle. Are you ready for us to start the RCS checkout now?
As soon as we finish the uplink. Stand by one. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Columbia. Comment on P22. Worked just fine. The crater I marked on is a small crater down inside crater 130 as described by John Young.
Roger. We copy.
Eagle, Houston. On our load - during our load, we had to do a VERB 96 to stop integration. We're going to start over again on this load. Over.
Eagle. Roger.
And, Eagle, here. I have read out address in the AGS 404, 405 and 406, and I had believed that 405 and 406 would both be all zeros, and I would propose maybe that I reset them to zero. I realize that 404 should be a negative number, and it is minus 13495. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Eagle, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Buzz, we've got - The only thing we're missing here is the drift check. After we finish our load, we'd like you to do the drift check with Columbia. Over.
GO.
Eagle, Houston. The 404, 405, 406 look fine to us. Over.
Roger. I am going to be setting them up to zero for the undocking. The question is do you want me to reset 404, 405, 406 back to the numbers that they are now, or can I leave them zero? I intend to set 404 to a minus 13495. Over.
Stand by.
Eagle, Houston. We would like you to zero, as called out in the timeline, all three addresses, 404, 405, 406, before undocking. After docking you can load them hack to the values that you have right now. Over.
Eagle. Roger.
And, Houston, Eagle here. Both RCS helium pressures are reading 2900. Over.
Copy. Out.
Eagle, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Buzz. There seems to be some confusion here on 405 and 406. We'd like you to zero them out prior to undocking, and after undocking you can - we'd like them still zeroed. Over.
Roger. I agree with that. Thank you.
Yes.
Eagle, Houston. We've got the load in the - We have reselected P00; your integration is going again for you; the computer is yours. We'd like to do the drift check now. Over.
Roger. In work.
Columbia, let's flick it in 0620 when you are ready.
Standing by until your Mark, Neil.
Okay. 3, 2, 1.
MARK.

Eagle, Houston. We've copied the angles and will read back if you are ready. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Neil.
For the CM - for Columbia: 35864, 02073, 35954.
For Eagle: 30374, 20078, 00053. Over.
That's correct, and GET was 99 hours and 4 minutes even.
Roger. Copy. Out.
Eagle, Houston. Have you initialized the AGS yet? Over.
Negative. I haven't had a state vector yet.
Roger, Buzz. Have you done the 377 yet?
Roger. Standing by for your K factor.
Roger. Stand by.
Columbia, Houston. We have got a load for you. Could we have P00 and ACCEPT? Over.
You got it.
Roger. Thank you, Mike. And break. Eagle, we've got a K factor for you. Over.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Roger, Buzz. K factor coming at you: 90 00 00 15. Over.
Roger. 90 00 00 15.
Roger. That's good. That's a good ENTER there.
Eagle, Houston. We recommend the AGS initial - Well, we see it coming up now on the AGS initialization. Over.
Roger.
Eagle, Houston. After the AGS initialization, we'll be ready for the RCS checkout.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. We got the load in. You can go back to BLOCK.
Thank you.
Columbia, Houston. Did you get a - copy any LM data, low bit rate, behind the Moon? Over.
That's affirmative.
Roger. Stand by.
Or at least I've configured for it. I'm not sure Eagle sent it or not.
No, we did not send V data. Eagle. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Eagle, Houston. The alignment and the initialization looked good to us. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. LOS is 99 30; next AOS 100 16. Over.

Eagle, Columbia. Let me know when you come to your RCS hot fire checks so I can disable my roll.
Wilco.
Roger. We're right there now. And we'd like you - CSM in MID deadband ATT hold. Over.
That's where I am.
And, Houston, you have high bit rate with us now, I believe? We're ready to proceed with the RCS checks.
Roger, Eagle. We're standing by. We're ready. Over.
Columbia, we'd like wide deadband ATT hold. Over.
Okay. Going wide deadband ATT hold.
You got it.
Are you going to do your hot fire now?
Roger.
Okay. I'm disabling my roll.
Roll is disabled.
Roger.
Roger. Would you believe you've got thrusters on board that vehicle.
Give me a call just as soon as your hot fire is complete, please.
Wilco.
Houston, Eagle. The RCS hot fire is complete. How did you observe it? Over.
Stand by. Eagle, Houston. The RCS hot fire looks super to us. We're all GO.
Roger. Mike, would you confirm that thrusters B3 and C4 are off? Over. And your radar transponder off.
C4 is off; B3 is off. Transponder is to HEATER which is the same as being off, and I've got my roll jets back on now.
And you're maneuvering. Right?
Will be shortly, Neil.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're GO for undocking. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Starting a trim maneuver to AGS CAL attitude.
Houston, Columbia.
Go ahead, Columbia. Over.
Roger. There will be no television of the undocking. I have all available windows either full of heads or cameras, and I'm busy with other things.
We concur. Over.
Okay.
And, Eagle, Houston. We'd like you to select aft OMNI now. It will be good for both LOS and AOS. Over.
Roger. Going to aft OMNI.
Apollo 11, Houston. One minute to LOS.

The Eagle has wings.
Roger.
Looking good.
Roger, Neil. We got a - If you will give us P00 and DATA, we've got the loads for you.
Okay. You've got it. P00 and DATA.
Roger. Let us know when you are ready to copy. We have a DOI PAD, and a PDI PAD. Over.
You check our tracking light, Mike?
Back off? Okay. I'm ready to start my yaw maneuver if it suits you, Mike.
Does it look like you are going to be able to do this without burning thrusters, Mike?
Go ahead, Houston. Eagle is ready to copy.
Roger, Eagle. Coming at you with a DOI PAD: 101 36 14.07. NOUN 81, minus 00758, plus all balls, plus 00098 plus - correction, 00572, perigee plus 00085 00764 030 000 293.

Roger. Good readback, Buzz. Out.
Neil, I'm maneuvering in roll.
Roger. I see you.
Houston, Eagle. Are you copying the very large numbers for range and range rate in VERB 83? And did you just give us a state vector that changed one of the two vehicles? Over.
Roger, Eagle. We gave you a LM state vector. We have not changed the CSM state vector, however. Over.
Okay. That explains it. Over.
Columbia, Houston. On my Mark 9 30 to ignition.
MARK.
9 30.
Eagle, Houston. Would you have Columbia go to the high gain, yaw 0, pitch minus 20. Over.
You want him to go to high gain yaw 0? Say again the numbers.
Roger, Neil. Yaw 0, pitch minus 20, high gain angles. Over.
Okay. Yaw 0, pitch minus 20 on the high gain.
That's affirmative. We've lost all data with him.
To Columbia?
He says he'll do that as soon as he gets around there.
Roger.
Okay.
Columbia, Houston. How do you read?
I read you loud and clear, Houston. How me?
Roger, Mike. Five by. On my Mark 7 minutes to ignition.
MARK.
Seven minutes.
I agree. Everything's looking real good.
Apollo 11, Houston. You are looking good for separation. You are GO for separation, Columbia. Over.
Columbia understands.
We're really stabilized, Neil. I haven't burned a thruster in 5 minutes.
I'll make a small trim maneuver.
Mike, what's going to be your pitch angle at SEP?
007 degrees.
Okay.
Is that close enough for you or do you want it to a couple of decimal places?
No. That's good.
I think you've got a fine looking flying machine there, Eagle, despite the fact you're upside down.
Somebody's upside-down.
Okay, Eagle. One minute until TIG. You guys take care.
See you later.
Houston, Columbia. My DSKY is reading 4.9, in X, 5.0 ..., make it and EMS 105.4. Over.
Roger. Copy. Columbia, it looks good to us. Over.
Thanks.
Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to terminate average G. Over.
Roger. In P00.
You're going right down U.S. 1, Mike.
Eagle, Columbia. At your convenience, I would like to switch over to VHF ranging modes.
Roger. Let's go to VHF ranging now.
Okay.
MARK.
Eagle, Columbia. I am reading you loud and scratchy. Neil is not coming through too well on his VOX. Could you be quiet for 15 seconds while I get this locked on.
Okay.
I've got a solid lock on. I have you at 0.27 miles.
Eagle, Houston. We've got a state vector for you. We'd like P00 and DATA. Over.

Roger. Good readback, Eagle. Out.
Would you put your tracking light on, please?
It's on, Mike.
Thank you.
Columbia, Houston. We've got the load in. You can go back to BLOCK. Over.
Is that for Columbia?
That's affirmative, Columbia.
Okay. Thank you, Houston.
Mike, you want to give us a Mark when you're right at 7 miles - I mean seven tenths of a mile?
Will do.
Okay. We just got seven tenths on the radar.
MARK.
Yes. I'm oscillating between 0.69 and seven tenths.
Very good. We've got 4200 on the ... meter.
I'm steady on 70 now. Yes. I read you sort of scratchy, but I read you.
Houston, Apollo - or Houston, Columbia. Over.
Roger. Go, Columbia. Over.
Roger. I still need a DOI P76 PAD, and a PDI 1 plus 12 P76 PAD sometime at your convenience.
Roger. Stand by.
Columbia, Houston. DOI P76 PAD, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Ready to copy.
Roger, Mike. NOUN 80 - correction, NOUN 84: minus 00758, plus all zeros, plus 00098; NOUN 33: 101 36 1400, and stand by for the PDI plus 12.

Roger. One error, Columbia, on the TIG for DOI; seconds was 1407. Over.
Roger. 1407.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to turn off your rotational direct - rotational control power direct number 2 off. Over.
It's off. Thank you.
Columbia, Houston. On those P76's, a friendly reminder from your FIDO: add half the burn time to the TIG. Over.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. We've lost data with Eagle. Will you please have him select aft OMNI? Over.
Eagle, this is Columbia. Houston would like you to select aft OMNI.
Roger. I got it now. Houston, you reading Eagle now on aft OMNI?
That's affirmative, Eagle. Reading you five by.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. We'll have LOS at 101 28. AOS for you 102 15. Over.
Thank you.
Eagle, Houston. It appeared to us when you were doing the P52, maneuvering the S band, the high gain went into the stop. Verify that both S band breakers are in. Over.
Roger. I think I'd gone up to 90.0 before it went there. The one on this side is in and I'll check the other later.
Okay. Thank you, Buzz.
Eagle, Houston. You are GO for DOI. Over.
Roger. GO for DOI. Do you have LOS and AOS times?
Roger. For you LOS at 101 28. AOS 102 16. Over.
Roger. Copy.
And, Buzz, S band steerable update for you on the angles at AOS: 219 and yaw 30. Over.
Roger. That's in the flight plan. Thank you.
Houston, Columbia. How are all the systems looking?
Say again, Over.
Just wanted to get a systems check from you sometime prior to LOS.
Roger.
Houston, Eagle. You can - Torquing angles NOUN 93 on four zeros and a 3 are minus 00292, plus 00289, minus 00094.
Roger. Copy. Stand by. Roger, Eagle. You can torque it. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Columbia, Houston. Your systems are looking good going over the hill. Approximately 7 minutes to LOS.
Thank you.
Eagle, Houston. Place the BIOMED to Commander. Over.
Roger. You got him.
Thank you, sir.
Eagle, Houston. We've lost the high bit rate. Would you please select low bit rate? Over.
You got it.
And, Eagle, on my Mark we'll have 12 minutes to ignition. Over.
Roger.
Eagle, Houston. Stand by for my Mark.
MARK.
Twelve minutes to ignition.
We copy.
Columbia/Eagle, Houston. Three minutes to LOS. Both looking good going over the hill.
Columbia. Roger.
Eagle. Roger,
Columbia, Houston. We're standing by. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Five by, Mike. How did it go? Over.
Listen, babe. Everything's going just swimmingly, Beautiful.
Great. We're standing by for Eagle.
Okay, He's coming along.
We copy. Out.
And, Columbia, Houston. We expect to lose your high gain sometime during the powered descent. Over.
Columbia. Roger. You don't much care do you?
No, sir.
Houston, Eagle. How do you read?
Five by, Eagle. We're standing by for your burn report. Over.
Roger. The burn was on time. The residuals before nulling: minus 0.1, minus 0.4, minus 0.1, X and Z nulled to zero ... nulling ...
Columbia, Houston. We've lost all data with Eagle. Please have him reacquire on the high gain, Over.
Eagle, this is Columbia. Houston would like you to reacquire on the high gain. They've lost your data. Over.
Eagle, did you copy Columbia?
Eagle, Houston. Did you call?
Eagle, Houston - Houston, Eagle. How do you read now?
Roger. Five by, Neil. We copied up to the AGS residuals. Would you please repeat the AGS residuals in the trim - correction - the Sun check? Over.
Roger. AGS residuals: minus 0.1, minus 0.2, minus 0.7. And we used the PGNS NOUN 86 for DELTA-VZ which was 9.5, versus yours which was 9.1, and I believe that may explain the difference. Apogee 57.2, perilune 9.1, Sun check to three marks, NOUN 20, minus NOUN 22, plus 0.19, plus 0.16, plus 0.11. Over.
Roger. Copy. Looks great.
Columbia, Houston. We've lost Eagle again. Have him try the high gain. Over.
Eagle, this is Columbia. Houston lost you again. They're requesting another try at the high gain.
Eagle, Houston. We have you now. Do you read? Over.
Loud and clear.
Roger. We see your VERB 47.
Yes. I don't know what the problem was there. It just started oscillating around in yaw. According to the needle, we're picking up a little oscillation right now, as a matter of fact.
Roger. We'll work on it.
Horizon checklist right on time.
Roger.
Did you copy the star - I mean the Sun check, Charlie?
That's affirmative. We did, Buzz. Out.
Eagle, Houston. The AGS initialization looked good to us. Over.
Roger.
Our radar checks indicate 50,000 foot perilune. Our visual altitude checks steadying out at about 53,000.
Roger. Copy.
And, Houston, we got a 500 alarm early in the program. Went to DESCENT 1, proceeded on it, and we're back at AUTO again. Over.
Roger. We saw that, Buzz. Thank you much. Out.
All right. I say again - Okay. That wasn't an alarm; that was a code. Okay.
Roger. We saw that.
Eagle, Houston. We recommend you yaw 10 right. It will help us on the high gain signal strength. Over.
Eagle, Houston. If you read, you're GO for powered descent. Over.
Eagle, this is Columbia. They just gave you a GO for powered descent.
Columbia, Houston. We've lost them on the high gain again. Would you please - We recommend they yaw right 10 degrees and reacquire.
Eagle, this is Columbia. You're GO for PDI and they recommend you yaw right 10 degrees and try the high gain again.
Eagle, you read Columbia?
Roger. We read you.
Okay.
Eagle, Houston. We read you now. You're GO for PDI. Over.

Roger. I think I've got you on high gain now.
Roger.
Say again the angles, though.
Roger.
I'll set them in to use them before we yaw around.
Roger. Pitch 212, yaw plus 37.
OMNI's in.
... 10 ... 10 percent ...
Columbia, Houston. We've lost them. Tell them to go aft OMNI. Over.
They've lost you. Use the OMNI's again.
...
Say again, Neil?
I'll leave it in SLEW. Relay to us. See if they have got me now. I've got good signal strength in SLEW.
Okay. You should have him now, Houston.
Eagle, we've got you now. It's looking good. Over.

Roger.
AGS and PGNS look real close.
At 7 minutes, you're looking great to us, Eagle.
Okay. I'm still on SLEW so we may tend to lose as we gradually pitch over. Let me try AUTO again now and see what happens.
Roger.
Okay. Looks like it's holding.
Roger. We got good data.
Eagle, Houston. It's descent 2 fuel to MONITOR. Over.
Going to 2.
Give us an estimated switchover time please, Houston.

Thank you.
You're looking good here.
Okay. We're going to be busy for a minute.

Yes. I heard the whole thing.
... good show.
Fantastic.
Engine STOP RESET.
Houston, Columbia went UPTELEMETRY COMMAND, RESET, to reacquire on the high gain.

Eagle, Houston. You loaded R2 wrong. We want 10254.
Roger.
And do you want V horizontal 5515.2?
That's affirmative.

Say again?
Like an AGS to PNGS align. Over.
Roger. We're standing by for it.
... quantity ...
Eagle, Houston. You are STAY for T2. Over.
Correction, you're - -
Roger. STAY for T2. We thank you.
Roger, sir.
Tranquility Base, Houston. We recommend you exit P12. Over.
Hey, Houston, that may have seemed like a very long final phase. The AUTO targeting was taking us right into a football field size - football field sized crater, with a large number of big boulders and rocks for about ... one or two crater diameters around it, and it required a ... in P66 and flying manually over the rock field to find a reasonably good area.
Roger. We copy. It was beautiful from here, Tranquility. Over.
We'll get to the details of what's around here, but it looks like a collection of just about every variety of shape, angularity, granularity, about every variety of rock you could find. The colors - Well, it varies pretty much depending on how you're looking relative to the zero-phase point. There doesn't appear to be too much of a general color at all. However, it looks as though some of the rocks and boulders, of which there are quite a few in the near area, it looks as though they're going to have some interesting colors to them. Over.
Roger. Copy. Sounds good to us, Tranquility. We'll let you press on through the simulated countdown, and we'll talk to you later. Over.
Roger.
Okay. This one sixth g is just like the airplane.
Roger. Tranquility. Be advised there's lots of smiling faces in this room and all over the world. Over.
Well, there are two of them up here.
Roger. That was a beautiful job, you guys.
And don't forget one in the command module.
Roger.
Tranquility, Houston. We have you pitched up about 4 1/2 degrees. Over.
That's confirmed by our local observation.
Roger.
And thanks for putting me on relay, Houston. I was missing all the action.
Roger. We'll enable MSFN relay.
I just got it, I think.
Roger, Columbia. This is Houston. Say something. They ought to be able to hear you. Over.
Roger, Tranquility Base. It sure sounded great from up here. You guys did a fantastic job.
Thank you. Just keep that orbiting base ready for us up there now.
Will do.
Columbia, Houston. LOS 103 27, AOS 104 13. Over.
Thank you.
Tranquility Base, Houston. All your consumables are solid. You're looking good in every respect. We copy the DPS are venting. Everything is copasetic. Over.
Thank you, Houston.
Houston, the guys that said that we wouldn't be able to tell precisely where we are are the winners today. We were a little busy worrying about program alarms and things like that in the part of the descent where we would normally be picking out our landing spot; and aside from a good look at several of the craters we came over in the final descent, I haven't been able to pick out the things on the horizon as a reference as yet.
Roger, Tranquility. No sweat. We'll figure out - We'll figure it out. Over.
You might be interested to know that I don't think we notice any difficulty at all in adapting to one sixth g. It seems immediately natural to move in this environment.
Roger, Tranquility. We copy. Over.
The area out the left hand window is a relatively level plain cratered with a fairly large number of craters of the 5  to 50 foot variety, and some ridges - small, 20, 30 feet high, I would guess, and literally thousands of little 1  and 2 foot craters around the area. We see some angular blocks out several hundred feet in front of us that are probably 2 feet in size and have angular edges. There is a hill in view, just about on the ground track ahead of us. Difficult to estimate, but might be a half a mile or a mile.
Roger, Tranquility. We copy. Over.
Sounds like it looks a lot better than it did yesterday - -
...
- - at that very low Sun angle. It looked rough as a cob then.
It really was rough, Mike. Over the targeted landing area, it was extremely rough, cratered, and large numbers of rocks that were probably some, many larger than 5 or 10 feet in size.
When in doubt, land long.
So we did.
Tranquility, Houston. After you get through this P57, we'd like an E memory dump. Over.
Roger. After this first P57, you want an E memory dump.
That's affirmative.
Columbia, Houston. We have a P22 update for you, if you're ready to copy. Over.
At your service, sir.
Roger, Mike. T1, 104 32 18; T2, 104 37 28. And that is 4 miles south. This is based on a targeted landing site. Over.
Okay. Roger. Understand based on a targeted landing site; T1, 104 32 18; T2, 104 37 28, and 4 miles south.
Roger.
Do you have any idea whether they landed left or right of center line? Just a little bit long, is that all we know?
Apparently that's about all we can tell. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Tranquility, Houston - -
And, Houston, our mission timer is now reading 902 34 47 and static.
Roger. Copy your mission timer's now static. It - Say again the time?
902 34 47.
Roger. Copy, Tranquility. That gravity align looked good to us. We see you recycling.
Well, no. I was trying to get time, 16 65 out, and somehow it proceeded on to the 622 before I could do a VERB 32 ENTER. I want to log a time here, and then I'd like to know whether you want me to proceed on the torquing angles or to go back and reenter again before torquing. Over.
Roger, Buzz. Stand by.
Tranquility, Houston. We'd like you to recall P57 and run through the gravity align one more time. Over.
Roger. I concur with that.
Roger, Tranquility. For the mission timer, two suggestions. Set the circuit breaker, panel 11; also reset and attempt to start. That nine in the first digit might have something to do with it. Over.
Okay. We've tried both of those. If the circuit breaker is in when I reset the - put it in RESET, I get 902 04 40. When I release it now, I get 902 04 49. I'm going to cycle the circuit breaker.
Roger.
I cycled the circuit breaker and got all nines. And we'll not now reset from all nines.
Roger.
Tranquility, Houston. We'll research this problem and be back with you momentarily on the mission event time - correction, the mission timer.
Okay.
I'd say the color of the - The local surface is very comparable to that we observed from orbit at this Sun angle, about 10 degrees Sun angle, or that nature. It's pretty much without color. It's gray, and it's a very white, chalky gray, as you look into the zero phase line; and it's considerably darker gray, more like a ash - ashen gray as you look out 90 degrees to the Sun. The - Some of the surface rocks in close here that have been fractured or disturbed by the rocket engine plume are coated with this light gray on the outside; but where they've been broken, they display a dark - very dark gray interior; and it looks like it could be country basalt.
Roger, Tranquility. We see the NOUN 93, VERB 34.
Roger. I assume you wanted it. Roger.
Tranquility, Houston. Please vent fuel and OX again. Over. It's building back up.
Okay. OX going now.
Tranquility, Houston. You can open both fuel and OX vent now. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Tranquility standing by for GO on a AGS to PGNS align and a lunar align. Over.
Stand by.
Tranquility, Houston. You are GO for the AGS to PGNS align and a lunar align. Over.
Roger.
Tranquility, Houston. Please vent the fuel. It's increasing rapidly. Over.
We show 30 psi in the fuel and 30 in the oxidizer.
Roger. We're reading somewhat different than that. Stand by.
The fuel temperature is reading 64 in the descent, and the oxidizer - that's descent 2 - and the oxidizer is off scale low. Descent 1 is showing 61 in the fuel and 65 in the oxidizer.
Roger. Stand by. Tranquility, Houston. Please take the fuel vent switch and hold it open. Over.
Okay. We're holding it open. Indicating about 24 psi on board.
Roger.
Now indicating 20 psi in the fuel side.
Roger.
And 22 in the OX.
Roger.
Now indicating 15 psi in both tanks.
Roger.
Tranquility, Houston. If you haven't done so, you can release the fuel vent switch now. Over.
Roger.
Tranquility, Houston. We have indication that we've frozen up the descent fuel helium heat exchanger, and there's some fuel trapped in the line between there and the valves; and the pressure we're looking at is increasing there. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Tranquility Base, Houston. If you have not done so, please close both fuel and OX vents now. Over.
They're closed.
Thank you, sir.
From the surface, we could not see any stars out the window; but out my overhead hatch, I'm looking at the Earth. It's big and bright and beautiful. Buzz is going to give a try at seeing some stars through the optics.
Roger, Tranquility. We understand. Must be a beautiful sight. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Two minutes to LOS. You're looking great going over the hill. Over.
Okay. Thank you. Glad to hear the system's looking good. You have a suggested attitude for me? This one here seems all right.
Stand by.
Let me know when it's lunch time, will you?
Say again.
Oh, disregard.
Columbia, Houston. You got a good attitude right there.
Okay. Thank you.
Tranquility Base, Houston. If you want me to, I can give you a hack on the mission time, every 30 minutes. Over.
Tranquility, Houston. I'm counting down to T3 time. If you'd like to give me a hack, we can set up an event timer. Over.
Okay. How about counting up?
Roger. You want it counting up? Stand by.
Tranquility, Houston. On my Mark, 62 30.
MARK.
62 30 from - past PDI.
What we're looking for, Charlie, is the time counting up to T2 that'll be equal to 60 minutes - or T3, be equal to 60 minutes on T3.
Roger. We'll have it for you.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Reset the event timer to zero and on my Mark at 103 39 41. We'll give you a hack, and it'll be 1 hour. Over.
Roger.
And we've got about - almost 3 minutes to go, Neil. Over.
Okay.
Tranquility Base, stand by on the event timer.
Tranquility Base, Houston. On my Mark start your event timer.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Roger. We got it; thank you.
Roger, Neil.
Tranquility, Houston. We see the star angle difference. Looks good.
Okay. That last star was Navi, and it wasn't too well distinguishable. I can see where that error could come in. I think for the gravity alignment with one star, Rigel will be quite good.
Roger. Stand by on the NOUN 93.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. We'd like you to torque that. Over.
Houston, this is Tranquility. Do you want us to accept this position? Over.
Tranquility, Houston. We're looking at it. Stand by. We'd like you to pull the circuit breaker on panel 11 for the mission timer. Over.
Roger. I've already done that, Charlie.
Okay.
Tranquility, Houston. We'd like you to reject that RLS. Over.
Roger.
And, Tranquility Base, Houston. We'd like you to call - after this, call P00, and give us a E memory dump.
Okay. Here comes the E memory dump.
Roger.
And we got 1106.
Roger.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. Did I copy PROGRAM ALARM 1106 from you? Over.
Roger. That' s affirmative.
Okay. Stand by.
Could that, by any chance, be due to the fact that I flashed the updata link switch to DATA while that was going on? Over.
Stand by.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. The SPAN guys think that's conceivable. Stand by. I think we want another VERB 74.
Okay. Standing by.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. We'd like another VERB 74. Over.
Roger. Here it comes.
Tranquility Base, Houston. On my Mark it will be GET 103 53.
MARK.

Roger, Tranquility. Good readback. We also have a CSI PAD if you are ready to copy.
Okay. We are ready to go.
Roger. Coming at you with a CSI: NOUN 11, 105 35 3700, 107 11 3000, 0538, minus all zeros. FDAI is NA, 0937 - correction, 09356, 10315, plus 0538, minus all zeros, plus 0012. Over.
Roger. Say again R1 and NOUN 86.
Roger. R1 is plus 0538, and we have a load for you. Will you please give us P00 and DATA? Over.
Roger. Before I do that I would like to designate the rendezvous radar up to plus-X.
Roger.
Okay. CSI readback: NOUN 11, 105 35 3700, 107 11 3000, 0538, minus all zeros, NA, 09356, 10315. NOUN 86, plus 0538, plus all zeros, and the last one was 0012. And what's the sign of that, please?
Tranquility, Houston. The DELTA-VY is minus all zeros. The DELTA-VZ is plus 0012. Over.
Roger. Plus 0012.
Roger. Good readback.
Houston, Tranquility Base. The DSKY's yours, and updata link to DATA.
Roger. Thank you, Tranquility.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. On my Mark it will be 37 minutes to T3. Over.
Okay.
Stand by.
MARK.
Thirty seven minutes till T3.
Okay. Thank you.
Tranquility, this is Houston. It's your computer. We got the load in. You can start your P57.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, Tranquility Base. Does somebody down there have a mike button keyed? Over.
Stand by, and we'll check.
Tranquility, Houston. Do you still hear it now? Over.
I still hear it. It sounds like somebody banging chairs around in the back room.
Roger. That's a VOGAA that you hear for the CSM to keep the noise down on the loop. Maybe we got a MSFN relay or something. Stand by.
Okay.
Tranquility, Houston. We got the MSFN relay in. You're hearing the VOGAA, which is a noise suppression device. We'll try to take it out. Over.
All right. Thank you.
Tranquility, Houston. It ought to be a little quieter up there now. We disabled the MSFN relay.
Okay. I think the noise has stopped now. Thank you, Charlie.
Roger.
Tranquility Base, Houston. On my Mark, 25 minutes till T3. Stand by.
MARK.
Twenty five minutes until T3.
Roger. Thank you, Charlie.
Houston, Columbia. How's it going?
Columbia, Houston. We're reading you about three by. Over.
Roger. I'm on OMNI Charlie. How's it going?
Roger. Understand. OMNI Charlie. Mike, be advised we have an update for you on the P22 for the LM. We estimate he landed about 4 miles downrange. Your T1 times are updated and your T2, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Ready to copy.
Ready to copy.
Okay. Roger, Columbia. T1 104 32 24, 104 37 33, 2 miles south. Time of closest approach is 104 39 08.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. We copy the NOUN 93. You can torque them. Over.
You said 4 miles long, is that correct, Houston?
That's affirmative, Columbia. It's about 4 miles long. Stand by. We'll have you a map location momentarily. Over.
Houston, Tranquility Base. Do you have an updated LM weight for us? Over.
That's affirmative. Stand by on the DAP. Our DAP PAD for you is LM weight 10906. Over.
Roger. 10906.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. With a latitude/longitude over two update for LM position. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Mike. We got an update on the LAT longitude for the LM, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Roger. Columbia, it's plus 7 - correction, plus 0.799 for the LAT, plus 11.730 for the longitude over two. Over.
Thank you. The altitude remain unchanged?
Say again. Over.
Does the altitude remain unchanged? ...
That's affirmative.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. You are stay for a T3. We have some surface block data if you're ready to copy. Over.
Roger. Understand we're stay for T3. Stand by.
Okay, Houston. Go ahead with your block data.

Roger.
Hello, Columbia. Houston. We will not come up on the MSFN relay. We'd like you to come on panel 9, turn on your VHF to TR. Over.
Okay. I'm on panel 9. Ready to receive. You want me to transmit for some reason with it?
Say again, Mike. You're about two by.
Roger. Panel 9 is configured VHF, RECEIVE. You want me to transmit with the HF for some reason? Why do you want me in TR?
Columbia, this is Houston. We don't want you to transmit, Mike. We just want you in that position in case you want to talk to Tranquility. Break. Tranquility, Houston. Say again. Over.
Roger. I have a fairly good sized difference between battery volts on 5 and 6; 6 is reading 33.5 and 5 is reading 36.5. Is that what you expect? Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Tranquility, Houston. They are both coming up in voltage. No problem. We're still GO. Over.
Roger.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. Could you please give us a readout now of all of your descent tank pressures? Over.
Okay, Houston. On descent 1, fuel and oxidizer are reading 10 psi; and descent 2, fuel is reading 10 psi, oxidizer 11 psi.
Roger, Tranquility. Thank you much. Out.
Houston, Tranquility Base is ready to go through the powerdown and terminate the simulated countdown.
Roger. Standby.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. You can start your powerdown now. Over.
Roger. It's in progress.
And, Tranquility Base, the White Team is going off now and letting the Maroon Team take over. We appreciate the great show. It was a beautiful Job, you guys.
Roger. Couldn't of had better agreement from all of you back there.
Houston, Tranquility.
Go, Tranquility. Over.
Roger. Our recommendation at this point is planning an EVA with your concurrence starting about eight o'clock this evening, Houston time. That is about 3 hours from now.
Stand by.
Well, we will give you some time to think about that.
Tranquility Base, Houston. We thought about it; we will support it. You're GO at that time. Over.
Roger.
You guys are getting prime time TV there.
Hope that little TV set works, but we'll see.
Roger.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. Was your eight o'clock Houston time a reference to opening the hatch or starting the PREP for EVA at that time? Over.
That would be hatch opening.
That's what we thought. Thank you much.
That might be a little later than that, but in other words, start the PREP in about an hour or so.
Houston, Columbia. Copy NOUN 49?
Stand by, Columbia.
Tranquility Base, Houston. That's fine. We are ready to support you any time, Neil. Over.
Roger.
Roger.
Break. Columbia, we see the NOUN 49. Stand by.
Columbia, Houston. We got the data. We would like a VERB 34. Over.
All right. Stand by one, Charlie, for the next one.
Roger, Columbia. Did - How did Tranquility look to you down there? Over.
Well, the area looks smooth, but I was unable to see him. I just picked out a distinguishable crater nearby and marked on it.
Roger.
It looks like a nice area, though.
Hello, Columbia. Houston. I understand you could not see Tranquility. What were you marking on? Over.
Houston, Columbia. I say again, I could not see him. AUTO optics pointed at a spot very close to the coordinates which you gave me, so I picked a tiny crater in that area and marked on it so I will be able to have repeatable data, but I was unable to see him.
Roger. Copy.
Hello, Tranquility Base. Houston. On our DPS venting and that fuel problem, our heat exchanger is cleared up. We heard that the ice is melted, and we are in good shape now. Out.
Houston. Tranquility is going to put the track modes in P00 now.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Columbia. Go.
Columbia, Houston. We noticed you are maneuvering very close to gimbal lock. I suggest you move back away. Over.
Yes. I am going around it, doing this CMC AUTO maneuvers to the PAD values of roll 270, pitch 101, yaw 45.
Roger, Columbia.
How about sending me a fourth gimbal for Christmas.
Columbia, Houston. You were unreadable. Say again please.
Disregard.
Columbia, Houston. Several items for you. Over.
Ready to copy.
Columbia, Houston. First of all, we'd like a waste water dump to 10 percent on the backside. Secondly, it does not look like we are going to need any plane change at this time, so we will not be uplinking a new REFSMMAT. Third item, I would like all of your CRYO heaters to AUTO, and we are ready for a battery charge, battery BRAVO; it will last about 7 hours. If you should go to sleep, we will be terminating that BATT charge, but at the moment, we can go ahead and start the BATT charge on BATT Bravo. And a final item, for your SM RCS configuration for your rest period, register 1 for the DAP is 11111; DAP register 2, 01100. And your AUTO RCS select switches, quad Alfa, pitch jets on only, quad Bravo all on, quad Charlie and quad Delta all off. Over.
Roger. Dump waste water to 10 percent on the backside. Use prior REFSMMAT, CRYO heaters on to AUTO, battery B charge until I go to sleep. DAP is 11111, 01100. Select quads A pitch only on, C and D all up. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Roger.
Columbia, Houston. We will have a state vector update for you a little later. We are not prepared with it right now; and on another subject, from Tranquility Base, they are prepared to begin their EVA early. They expect to begin DEPRESS operations in about 3 hours at 108, approximately 108 GET. Over.
Sounds good to me. Tell them to eat some lunch before they go.
Columbia, Houston. We'd like your PRD readouts when possible, and we've checked over your EM dump. It all looks okay.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Tranquility, Houston. We'd like your PRD readout, and we have double checked your EM dump. It all looks okay. Over.
Roger. Understand our E memory dump was good. CDR's dosimeter is 11014.
And LMP is 09011.
Roger, Tranquility. Break. Columbia, we would like for you to REACQ with your high gain; attempt a manual lock on. Over.
...
Houston, Tranquility here. The LMP's readout may possibly be 09017. Over.
Tranquility, Houston. Roger. 09017 is an update on your readout.
Columbia's in high gain.
I'll let you know for sure when it goes to either 12 or 18.
Tranquility, Houston. Roger. The medics report your latter reading, 17, appears to be the correct one. Over.
Roger.
Columbia's in the high gain.
Roger, Columbia. You're sounding much better now.
Columbia, Houston. Request P00 in ACCEPT, and we'll uplink another state vector. Over.
Roger. Going P00 in ACCEPT.
Columbia, Houston. Suggest you put BATT A on your BATT relay bus. Over.
Okay.
Columbia, Houston. We're through with your computer. You can go to BLOCK.
Roger. BLOCK.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Tranquility Base.
Tranquility Base, Houston. We've reviewed the checklist, and about the only change in order to advance the EVA that we've found is that you'll want to delay your lithium hydroxide change until after the EVA rather than before. Over.
Roger. We'd just as soon make a change and jettison the old one. Over.
Tranquility Base, Houston. We would like to delay that LOIO - LiOH change until after the EVA. There is a possibility you could jettison the canister when you jettison your PLSS. Over.
All right. We'll plan it that way. Over.
Roger, Tranquility.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Houston, Columbia.
Columbia, Houston. We show your EVAP OUT temperature running low. Request you go to manual temperature control and bring it up. You can check the procedures in ECS MAL 17. Over.
Roger, Houston.
Columbia, Houston. I have a P22 update for you.
Columbia. Go ahead.
Columbia, Houston. Your P22 AUTO - AUTO optics landmark ID on LM. T1, 106 plus 30 plus 31; T2, 106 plus 35 plus 41, 2 nautical miles south. Your TCA, 106 plus 37 plus 16. Shaft angle 357.9 and trunnion angle 44.3. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Columbia, Houston. We have your LOS in 3 minutes. AOS will be 106 plus 11. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Tranquility. Over.
Tranquility, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. This is the LM pilot. I'd like to take this opportunity to ask every person listening in, whoever and wherever they may be, to pause for a moment and contemplate the events of the past few hours and to give thanks in his or her own way. Over.
Roger, Tranquility Base.
That's about ready to fall off.
As a matter of fact, it just doesn't look like it sunk in at all.
Tranquility Base, Houston. We'd like some estimate of how far along you are with your eating and when you may be ready to start you EVA PREP. Over.
I think that we'll be ready to start EVA PREP in about a half an hour or so.
Roger, Tranquility.
Houston, Columbia. How do you read?
Columbia, Columbia. This is Houston.
Houston, this is Tranquility Base. We are beginning our EVA PREP.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston, Roger. Copy. You're beginning EVA PREP. Break. Break. Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. Over.
You're loud and clear. The waste water dump is down to 10 percent. I have a question on the P22. Do you want me to do another P22, or is all that information just for my own use in tracking the LM for photographic purposes?
Columbia, this is Houston. We request that you perform another P22. We'd like you to let the AUTO optics take care of the tracking and devote your energies to trying to pick out the LM on the lunar surface. If you can find the LM, of course. We're looking for marks on it; but tracking of geographical features doesn't do us all that much good. Over.
Okay. Fine. I'll do it. And on the ECS system, the - Whatever the problem was, it seems to have gone away without any changing of J52 sensors or anything like that. My glycol evaporator outlet TEMP is up above 50 now, and it's quite comfortable in the cockpit; so we'll talk more about that one later.
Roger, Columbia. Did you shift into manual control, or did the problem resolve itself under AUTO control? Over.
The problem went away under AUTO.
Roger. That's the best type. Out.
I did cycle out of AUTO into - I did cycle out of AUTO into MANUAL, back into AUTO.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Tranquility Base, Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Tranquility, this is Houston. We need a second set of PRD readings so that we may establish a rate. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
CDR is reading 11014.
LMP is reading 09017 and three quarters.
Tranquility, this is Houston. We copy your readings, Out.
Houston, Columbia. How do you read on OMNI D, Dog?
Columbia, this is Houston. We're reading you loud with background noise on OMNI D. Over.
Okay. I'll stay on D here for a while. I'm about to go into ...
Roger. Out.
Houston, Columbia. I'm coming up on my time for the first pass when I may - -
Now while we've got time, you can.
- - be able to see the LM. Do you have any topographical cue that might help me out here? AUTO optics is tracking between two craters. One of them, as the LM sees it, would be long at 11 o'clock. The other would be short and behind him at 5 o'clock. They're great big old craters - depressions.
Stand by.
Columbia, this is Houston. The best we can do on topo features is to advise you to look to the west of the irregularly shaped crater, and then work on down to the southwest of it. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Another possibility is the southern rim of the southern of the two old looking craters. Over.
Roger, Houston. Columbia ... I kept my eyes glued to the sextant that time hoping I'd get a flash of reflected light off the LM, but I wasn't able to see any of my scan areas that you suggested.
Roger. On that southern of the old craters, there's a small bright crater on the southern rim. One plot would put him slightly to the west of that small bright crater, about 500 to 1000 feet. Do you see anything down there? Over.
Its going past now, Bruce, but I scanned that area that you are talking about very closely, and no, I did not see anything.
Roger. Out.
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Columbia, this is Houston. On your LAM 2 map, we'd like to confirm the topographical area in which you were looking on this last period of sightings. As we understand you, you were looking in the vicinity of Papa 7 to November 8. Is that correct? Over.
Stand by one.
Roger.
Houston, Columbia.
Go ahead, Columbia.
One of the craters I was talking about is located exactly at Mike 6.7.
Roger. We found that one.
The other one is located at 7 - The other one is located at 7.2, two thirds of the way from Mike to Nan.
Roger. We believe you were looking a little too far to the west and south. Over.
Roger. Understand. I was looking where auto optics was tracking, on the average, and understand that it should have been more to the north and more to the west; actually a tiny bit outside the circle, huh?
More to the north and a little more to the east. The feature that I was describing to you, the small bright crater on the rim of the large, fairly old crater, would be about Mike 0.8 and 8.2. Over.
Well, just give me your best estimate as to his location and his coordinate system, and I'll plot it on my map and go from there.
Roger.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Can you give us some idea of where you are in the surface checklist at the present time? Over.
Okay. We're at the top of page 27.
Roger. Out
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Go ahead, Columbia.
Roger. I finally got you back on OMNI D. I've been unsuccessfully trying to get you on the high gain, and I've gone COMMAND RESET to PROCESS. How do you read me now?
Roger. Reading you loud with background noise. Understand that's OMNI Delta or OMNI Bravo? Over.
OMNI Delta and you were cut out. I never got your coordinates on estimated LM position. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Estimated LM position is latitude plus 0.799, longitude over 2 plus 11.730. On your chart we would place it - Stand by on the charts and readback on the latitude and longitude.
Yes. The latitude and longitude over 2, 799 and 11730 are the ones that I been using in P22. But what I'm interested in is - is grid coordinates on that map we're using.
Roger. We'll have them for you in a second.
Thank you.
Houston, Columbia. Could you enable the S band relay at least one way from Eagle to Columbia so I can hear what's going on?
Roger. There's not much going on at the present time, Columbia. I'll see what I can do about the relay.
Columbia, this is Houston. Are you aware that Eagle plans the EVA about 4 hours early? Over.
Affirmative. When's hatch open time in GET estimated?
Roger. Somewhere around 108 hours. We'll have an update for you on that a little later.
Okay. I haven't heard a word from those guys, and I thought I'd be hearing them through your S band relay.
Roger. They're on about page Surface 27 in the checklist, proceeding in good time.
Glad to hear it.
You got a crowd there in MCC?
Roger. You're last, Columbia.
Roger. I expect you probably have about nine CAP COMMS and 11 Flight Directors with no place to plug in.
Roger. Out.
That ratio might even be reversed.
Glycol evaporator outlet temperature is 50 degrees and the comfort in here is just fine.
Roger. We copy 50 degrees on the glycol, and comfort index fine.
If you'll excuse me a minute, I'm going to have a cup of coffee.
Roger.
Apollo - Columbia, this is Houston. Your map coordinates are Papa decimal 2 and 6 decimal 3 on the LAM 2 chart. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy the coordinates for the LM? Over.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. If you read we request high gain antenna, yaw 180, pitch 0. I say again, yaw 180, pitch 0 on the high gain. Over.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston, Columbia on the high gain.
Columbia, this is Houston reading you loud and clear. Over.
Read you loud and clear, Bruce.
Roger, Mike. I have the coordinates - -
What's new?
Well, what's new is I think we have some more coordinates for you on the LM location. Over.
Ready to copy.
Roger, Mike. Papa 0.2 and 6.3 on your LAM 2 chart. Over.
Roger. Papa 0.2 and who 0.3?
6.3, I say again, 6.3.
Thank you. Papa 0.2 and 6.3. I'll try them.
Roger.
Okay. What you are saying is, if you look at the cat's paw, then that's just about, oh - his middle finger, a little bit - one to two o'clock from his middle finger. Is that right?
Roger. About one to two o'clock from the middle finger if you are using 12 o'clock being to the west. Over.
That must be the way the cat's faced. Okay. I'm with you.
Okay. And I got LOS and AOS times for you.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Your LOS at 107 plus 23 plus 03. AOS at 108 plus 09 plus 06. The next pass for COAS tracking: your time of closest approach is 108 35 28. That's 3 miles south of track. Over.
I understand all that, but with this new information would you like me to try P22 and look for him in a different spot?
Stand by a minute, please.
Okay. Because I was looking in the wrong place last time. AUTO optics was not pointing me at the coordinates you gave me.
Roger.
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
On your next pass, Columbia, rather than performing a P22 as such, we would like you to look in the vicinity of the coordinates that we gave you, which is our best analysis based on map physics and the trajectory, and we also have another set of coordinates that we would like you to search in the vicinity of. This last one being based on all interpretation of the geological features that were seen by the crew on their way down. The coordinates of this second site are Mike 0.7 and 8.0. I say again, Mike 0.7 and 8.0. I say again, Mike 0.7 and 8.0. Over.
Roger. Copy. Mike 0.7 and 8.0. The only thing is, my best tool for looking is the sextant and if I'm going to crank the sextant up, I might as well let P22 go at the same time, or don't you think so?
Roger. If you want to go that way, crank it up and then you can drive it around and look where you want. Over.
Okay.
And if you can find the LM, then by all means, track it or make a note of where it was and we can track it on the next REV. If you are ready, we have a REFSMMAT update that we can pass up to you at this time, if you will give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.
Okay. P00 in ACCEPT you got. And this is an updated landing site RESFMMAT. We still believe that a plane change is not required. Is that affirmative?
That's affirmative, Columbia.
Good show.
Columbia, this is Houston. We are through with the uplink. It's your computer.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, Columbia.
Go ahead, Columbia.
On our next pass, I'd appreciate the S band relay mode. Over.
Roger. We're working on that. There haven't been any transmissions from Tranquility Base since we last talked to you. We cannot give you a full S band relay without being assured of high gain antenna. We're working on the partial relay for you. Over.
Okay. Understand, Bruce. Thank you very much.
Columbia, this is Houston. Approximately 2 minutes to LOS. All your systems are looking good from down here. Over.
Does it look to you like the 240 controller is properly controlling the glycol evaporator outlet TEMP? It locks all right up here.
Roger, Columbia. During this pass on the front side, it looked okay to us.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Tranquility Base.
Go ahead Tranquility Base.
Okay. We are on about the middle of page 28, Surface - 28.
Roger, Tranquility. We copy
All right -
... minimum.
I think we'd ... to put ...
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Tranquility. We're coming up in about 6 minutes on GET of 108. If you'd like to start your event timer, we can give you a hack at 108 00. Over.
Wilco.
Houston, Tranquility. We're ready to start with the electrical checkout. We're going to S band modulate FM. Over.
Roger. Tranquility, this is Houston. We copy. Go ahead with the FM. And we missed the mark at 108. Do you want us to try and give you one at 108 05? Over.
I think we've got the timer going. We've got 1 minute and 30 seconds.
MARK.
Roger. We copy, and you're in SYNC with us.
It's increase.
T/R.
In.
Help you on that?
Feed it, or disconnect, or what?
Say again.
Connect PLSS electrical umbilical to PGA.
Let me *** up tight *** have to *** up straight *** up. Got her about ***
That's got it.
*** Right.
Fastest VOX in the west.
Mark. All right. Okay.
Aren't they?
Well, we've got antennas down and *** not real good, is it? Okay. Yours is up. We'll put my antenna up.
Okay.
Okay.
How do you read now?
Okay.
Okay. I think that's going to be better.
You read me all right now?
Yes.
Okay. That sounds pretty good.
I guess it's a combination of the volume and the antenna. May have been just the volume that was way up too high. Why don't you try stowing it again; see if that makes any difference.
Okay.
All right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. That - That sounds pretty good.
... Okay?
Better keep it pretty close to your mouth, though.
Okay. Open up your audio circuit breaker, and disconnect the LM COMM cable.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Columbia on the high gain. How do you read ?
Roger, Columbia. Reading you loud and clear on the high gain. We have enabled the one way MSFN relay that you requested. The crew of Tranquility Base is currently donning PLSS's. The LMP has his PLSS on, COMM checks out, and the CDR is checking his COMM out now. Over.
Sounds good. Thank you kindly.
Houston, Columbia. I tweaked the platform up on the back side. I have a P52 option 3 when you're ready to copy the data.
Go ahead, Columbia.
Roger. Stars 43 and 44: star angle difference 4 balls 1, NOUN 93 plus 000 - -
Audio circuit breaker CLOSED.

Got her.
Houston, Tranquility. How do you read ? Over.
Neil, Neil, this is Houston through Tranquility. Radio check. Over.
Roger. Houston, this is Neil. How do you read?
Neil, this is Houston. We're reading you loud and clear. Break, break. Buzz, this is Houston through Tranquility. Over.
Roger, Houston. This is Buzz through Tranquility. How do you read? Over.
We're reading you loud and clear, Buzz. Out.
*** and are you getting a signal on the TV? Over.
That's affirmative, Neil. The data that we're receiving looks good and we are receiving SYNC pulses and a black signal on TV.
Okay. You'll find that the area around the ladder is in a complete dark shadow so we're going to have some problem with TV, but I'm sure you will see the - You'll get a picture from the lighted horizon ...
This is Houston. We copy, and right toward the end of your transmission after you mentioned lighted horizon, you trailed off down into the noise level, Neil. Over.
Okay.
Columbia, this is Houston. Are you reading Tranquility all right on the relay? Over.
I believe so. I haven't heard anything fairly lately, and it's breaking up. But up until about 3 minutes ago, I was reading them loud and clear.
Roger. Sounds like you're getting it all.
Thank you.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. We request you open the TV circuit breaker at the present time. We've had it on about 15 minutes now with the MESA closed. Over.
Roger.
Houston, do you read ***
Say again, Neil.
***
Neil, Neil, this is Houston. I can hear you trying to transmit; however, your transmission is breaking up. Over.
Roger. ***
Buzz, Buzz, this is Houston. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Houston. This is Buzz. How do you read? Over.
Roger. You're coming through loud and clear, Buzz. It's a beautiful signal.
Neil's got his antenna up now. Let's see if he comes through any better now.
Okay. Houston, this is Neil. How do you read?
Neil, this is Houston. Reading you beautifully.
(Static) My antenna's scratching the roof.
We copy, your antenna scratching the roof. Roger.
They hear everything but that.
Houston, this is Tranquility. We're standing by for a GO for cabin DEPRESS. Over.

Verified.
I don't know if you guys can read me on VHF, but you sure sound good down there.
And locked.
Okay.
All right. The vent window is clear. And remove LEVA from the engine cover. Verify EV visor is attached.
How's the COMM now, Houston? Over.
Buzz, this is Houston. The COMM is very good. You are coming in loud and clear, and Mike passes on the word that he is receiving you and following your progress with interest.
Very well, thank you.
Got all the material up in the back?
Complete.
Helmet locked?
Yes. Locked and aligned.
Now, if you'll pull the RCU down.
Wonder if we're triggering all the time.
I don't think so.
Houston, Neil. How do you read?
Neil, this is Houston. Read you loud and clear and I read both the comments that said: "I wonder if we're triggering all the time" and "I don't think so." Prior to that it was relatively quiet. Over.
Okay. We're hearing a little bit of background noise, and I just wanted to make sure that we weren't continually keyed.
Don't sound like it.
Want to put the light back up?
Neil, this is Houston. Would you verify your RCU vent window's clear? Over.
That's verified.
Roger. Out.
That's good.
Okay.
...
Okay. We can stow this.
Okay. It is stowed. All right, PREP for EVA.
First you connect the water hose.
Okay. Let me get yours.
Okay. Now we should be able to stow these. Huh?
Columbia, this is Houston. Any joy on the LM that pass? Over.
Okay. They're all stowed. Connect PLSS water hose to PGA. Let's see; let me do that.
Okay. That's in and locked.
Okay.
Houston, Buzz here. Over.
Go ahead, Buzz. This is Houston.
Roger. Our COMM just seemed to clear up a good bit. Did CSM just go over the hill?
Negative. He's been over the hill, here, for a minute or so.
Correction -
Okay.
He should be losing contact with you in about a minute.
The flag locks are comp - checked. *** locks are checked, blue locks are checked, lock locks, red locks, purge locks; and on this side, the PLSS locks, and lock locks; both sides, water locks and the COMM.

Mine is back to EMU. Already done that pretty well.
Pretty well, complete.
Okay.
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Go ahead.
Roger. Were you successful in spotting the LM on that pass? Over.
That's negative. I checked both locations, and no joy.
Okay. If you'd like to look again next pass, we have a different set of coordinates based on the onboard P57 solution of the LM. These are Echo 0.3 and 4.8. I say again Echo 0.3, 4.8, same chart. Over.
Roger. I'll look there. And, also, how about putting that in your machine and coming out with some coordinates: latitude and longitude over 2, and altitude for P22, so it can help me as best it can.
Roger.
That P22 is still pointing in the wrong way.
Columbia, this is Houston. Latitude plus 0.523, longitude divided by 2, 11.710. Over.
Roger. Understand plus 00523 and plus 11710. Thank you.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Columbia, this is Houston. We're requesting high gain antenna, pitch, yaw, - pitch 0, yaw 200. That is, pitch 0, yaw 200. Over.
*** cooling unit circuit ***
Houston, this is Neil. How do you read?
Neil, this is Houston. Loud and clear.
Okay. That's a little bit better now. There we go.
Roger. Read you and clear.
You're not too loud and clear, but I think it's the same problem. Houston, how do you read Buzz?
Buzz, this is Houston. Loud and clear. You're really coming in beautifully. Over.
Very good.
Okay. Cabin REPRESS closed.
Okay.
Now. Now for the gymnastics.
What?
Now comes the gymnastics.
Oh, I think it'll be a lot easier.
Okay, I want to go to DUMP and go down to 3.5 and back to AUTO.
Okay, Going dump and it's down to 4.2, 4.1, - -
That's 3.5. Are you in AUTO? Verify cabin pressure at 3.5 and LM suit circuit pressure between 3.6 and 4.3.
It is. Suit circuit's at about 43.
Okay. Verify the PGA pressure is above 45, minus 46.
Minus 47.
Neil, this is Houston. Will you give us hack when you start - -
***
- - your chronometer. Over.
Roger.
Give it to them later.
Okay. Okay, let's go to dump.
Dump. Go to dump.
Houston, I'll set my watch at 56. Over.
Roger.
3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Houston, Columbia is back on the high gain.
Roger, Columbia. Loud and clear. And we copied you Mark there, Buzz.
Okay. I've got my water warning.
Okay. Water warning.
Is that yours?
Yes. Got mine.
Okay. Cabin pressure going towards zero. Verify LM suit circuit 36 to 43. That's verified. FIPGA pressure above 4.5. Okay. 4.7, coming down. Ready to open the hatch when we get to zero.
You want to bring down one of your visors now or leave them up? I'll read *** okay.
Inner visor down.
Four tenths of a pound in the cabin.
Down to about 0,2.
Sure takes a long time to get all the way down, doesn't it?
Yes.
Let me see if it will open now.
Okay.
Open my RCU there, would you, Buzz?
Push outward.
Need some light?
It's unlocked, yes.
Unlocked.
That'll be good enough.
It'll pop open.
Get a steady tone in the background?
I have a - static. A little bit of static.
I've got a little bit of a steady tone.
I don't guess I hear that.
Neil, this is Houston. What's your status on hatch opening? Over.
Everything is GO here. We're just waiting for the cabin pressure to bleed so - to blow enough pressure to open the hatch. It's about 0.1 on our gage now.
Sure hate to tug on that thing. Alternative would be to open *** too.
Neil, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We're showing a relatively static pressure on your cabin. Do you think you can open the hatch at this pressure of about 1.2 psi?
We're going to try it.
Roger.
The hatch is coming open.
Okay, Hold it from going closed and I'll get the valve to - -
Okay.
No. I'd better get up first.
Okay. The valves in AUTO.
Okay.
Might want to fill it up to FORWARD.
Your window cleared yet? Your water window cleared yet?
It was, yes.
Mine hasn't cleared yet.
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Columbia. Go ahead.
Columbia, this is Houston. We'd like you to cycle the fans in CRYO hydrogen tank number 1, and LOS time this orbit is 111 19 31.
Correction - Make that for the next orbit. You already have the AOS/LOS for this orbit.
Roger on time, and you want to cycle the fan in CRYO hydrogen tank 1.
Roger. Out.
Have you got your water valve on there?
Yes.
Columbia, this is Houston. We show you nearing high gain antenna scan limits. When you lose lock on us, we request OMNI Delta. OMNI Delta when you lose lock. Over.
Roger. OMNI Delta.
Okay. My window's cleared. I'm going to go to turn my cooling up a little bit.
Okay. My window's clear.
All RCU windows are clear. And suit circuit is 42 - 43. And I got ascent pressure light, a VF light, and a ECS light.
And we've got a water separater light. Hold it and I'll check.
All right.
And I'll look at your cabin fan 1 circuit breaker, and you look at glycol secondary.
I've got good cooling now.
Me, too.
Okay. Glycol pump secondary circuit breaker open?
I can see that. I have to lean this way.
Can't go any further.
My cabin fan 1 ***
Yes, That's good.
Can you check it?
It's open. Verified.
Okay. PGNS radar circuit breaker's open.
Well, I'm looking head on at it. I'll get it.
Okay. Let's get your antenna.
You'll have to fix my antenna.
Well, ready? - -
About ready to go down and get some Moon rock?
My antenna's out. Okay. Now we're ready to hook up the LEC here.
All right. That should go down with no twists at all. Put the bag up this way, that's even. Neil, are you hooked up to it?
Yes. Okay. Now we need to hook this.
Move that up there.
Okay.
Okay. Your visor.
Okay. Your back is up against the purse. All right. Now it's on top of the DSKY. Forward and up; now you are clear. Little bit toward me. Straight down, to your left a little bit. Plenty of room. Neil, you're lined up nicely. Toward me a little bit, down. Okay. Now you're clear. You're catching the first hinge on the bottom.
What hinge?
All right. Move, here roll to the left. Okay. Now you're clear. You're lined up on the platform. Put your left foot to the right a little bit. Okay. That's good. Roll left, Good.
Okay. Now I'm going to check PLSS here.
Okay. You're not quite squared away. Roll to the - roll right a little. Now you're even.
That's okay?
That's good. You've got plenty of room to your left. It's a little close on the ***
How am I doing?
You're doing fine.
Okay. Do you want those bags?
Yes. Got it.
Okay. Houston, I'm on the porch.
Roger, Neil.
Okay. Stand by, Neil.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. One minute and 30 seconds to LOS. All systems GO. Over.
Columbia. Thank you.
Stay where you are a minute, Neil.
Okay. Need a little slack?
You need more slack, Buzz?
No. Hold it just a minute.
Okay.
Okay. Everything's nice and straight in here.
Okay. Can you pull the door open a little more?
All right.
Okay.
Did you get the MESA out?
I'm going to pull it now.
Houston, the MESA came down all right.
This is Houston, Roger. We copy. And we're standing by for your TV.
Houston, this is Neil. Radio check.
Neil, this is Houston. Loud and clear. Break. Break. Buzz, this is Houston. Radio check, and verify TV circuit breaker in.
Roger, TV circuit breaker's in, and read you five square.
Roger. We're getting a picture on the TV.
You got a good picture, huh?
There's a great deal of contrast in it, and currently it's upside down on our monitor, but we can make out a fair amount of detail.
Okay. Will you verify the position - the opening I ought to have on the camera?
Stand by.
Okay. Neil, we can see you coming down the ladder now.
Okay. I just checked getting back up to that first step, Buzz. It's - not even collapsed too far, but it's adequate to get back up.
Roger. We copy.
It takes a pretty good little jump.
Buzz, this is Houston. F/2 - 1/160th second for shadow photography on the sequence camera.
Okay.
I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM footpads are only depressed in the surface about 1 or 2 inches, although the surface appears to be very, very fine grained, as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. Down there, it's very fine.
I'm going to step off the LM now.
That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.
And the - the surface is fine and powdery. I can - I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. I only go in a small fraction of an inch, maybe an eighth of an inch, but I can see the footprints of my boots and the treads in the fine, sandy particles.
Neil, this is Houston. We're copying.
There seems to be no difficulty in moving around as we suspected. It's even perhaps easier than the simulations at one sixth g that we performed in the various simulations on the ground. It's actually no trouble to walk around. Okay. The descent engine did not leave a crater of any size. It has about 1 foot clearance on the ground. We're essentially on a very level place here. I can see some evidence of rays emanating from the descent engine, but a very insignificant amount.
Okay, Buzz, we ready to bring down the camera?
I'm all ready. I think it's been all squared away and in good shape.
Okay.
Okay. You'll have to pay out all the LEC. It looks like it's coming out nice and evenly.
Okay. It's quite dark here in the shadow and a little hard for me to see that I have good footing. I'll work my way over into the sunlight here without looking directly into the Sun.
Okay. It's taut now.
Okay. I think you're pulling the wrong one.
I'm just - Okay. I'm ready to pull it down now. There was still a little bit left in the -
Okay. Don't hold it quite so tight.
Okay.
Looking up at the LM, I'm standing directly in the shadow now looking up at Buzz in the window. And I can see everything quite clearly. The light is sufficiently bright, backlighted into the front of the LM, that everything is very clearly visible,
Okay. I'm going to be changing the ***
Okay.
The camera is installed on the RCU bracket, and I'm storing the LEC on the secondary strut.
I'll step out and take some of my first pictures here.
Roger. Neil, we're reading you loud and clear. We see you getting some pictures and the contingency sample.
Neil, this is Houston. Did you copy about the contingency sample? Over.
Roger. I'm going to get to that just as soon as I finish these picture series.
Okay. Going to get the contingency sample there, Neil.
Right.
Okay. That's good.
Okay. The contingency sample is down and it's ***. Looks like it's a little difficult to dig through the initial crust.
This is very interesting. It's a very soft surface, but here and there where I plug with the contingency sample collector, I run into a very hard surface, but it appears to be very cohesive material of the same sort. I'll try to get a rock in here. Just a couple.
That looks beautiful from here, Neil.
It has a stark beauty all its own. It's like much of the high desert of the United States. It's different but it's very pretty out here. Be advised that a lot of the rock samples out here, the hard rock samples, have what appear to be vesicles in the surface. Also, I am looking at one now that appears to have some sort of phenocryst.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Okay. The handle is off the *** in about 6 or 8 inches into the surface. I could *** easy ***.
Yes, it is. it's - I'm sure I could push it in farther, but it's hard for me to bend down further than that.
Now, you can throw so far.
You can really throw things a long way up here.
That pocket open, Buzz?
Yes, it is. It's not up against your suit though. Hit it back once more. More toward the inside. Okay. That's good.
That in the pocket?
Yes. Push down.
Got it?
No. It's not all the way in. Push it. There you go.
Contingency sample is in the pocket. My oxygen is 81 percent. I have no flags, and I'm in minimum flow.
This is Houston. Roger, Neil.
Okay. I have got the cameras on at one frame a second.
Okay.
And I've got the 80 percent, no flags.
Are you getting a TV picture now, Houston?
Neil, yes we are getting a TV picture.
Neil, this is Houston. We're getting a picture. You're not in it at the present time. We can see the bag on the LEC being moved by Buzz, though. Here you come into our field of view.
...
Roger.
Hold it a second. First let me move that over the edge for you.
Okay. Are you ready for me to come out?
Yes. Just stand by a second. I'll move this over the handrail.
Okay.
All right. That's got it. Are you ready?
All set. Okay. You saw what difficulties I was having. I'll try to watch your PLSS from underneath here.
All right. The backup camera's positioned.
Okay. Your PLSS is - Looks like it is clearing okay. Your toes are about to come over the sill. Okay. Now drop your PLSS down. There you go; you're clear. And laterally you're good. You've got an inch clearance on top of your PLSS.
Okay. You need a little bit of arching of the back to come down. ... How are are my feet from the edge?
Okay. You're right at the edge of the porch.
Okay. Back in *** little of foot movement *** porch. Little arching of the back. Helmet comes up and clears the bulkhead without any trouble at all.
Looks good.
Neil, this is Houston. Based on your camera transfer with the LEC, do you foresee any difficulties in SRC transfer? Over.
Negative.
Okay. Now I want to back up and partially close the hatch.
Making sure not to lock it on my way out.
(Laughter) A pretty good thought.
That's our home for the next couple of hours and we want to take good care of it. Okay. I'm on the top step and I can look down over the RCU, landing gear pads. It's a very simple matter to hop down from one step to the next.
Yes. I found I could be very comfortable, and walking is also very comfortable.
You've got three more steps and then a long one.
Okay. I'm going to leave that one foot up there and both hands down to about the fourth rung up.
There you go.
Okay. Now I think I'll do the same ***
A little more. About another inch.
There you got it.
That's a good step. About a 3-footer.
Beautiful view!
Isn't that something! Magnificent sight out here.
Magnificent desolation.
Looks like the secondary strut *** little thermal effects on it right here, Neil.
Yes. I noticed that. That seems to be the worst, although similar effects are on - all around.
... powder, isn't it?
Isn't it fine?
Right in this area I don't think there's much of any *** fine powder *** clods together, and it's hard to tell whether it's a clod or a rock.
Notice how you can kick it out.
Yes. And it bounces and then -
Reaching down is fairly easy. I got my suit dirty at this stage.
The mass of the backpack does have some effect in inertia.
There's a slight tendency, I can see now, to *** backwards *** due to the soft, very soft texture.
You're standing on a rock, a big rock there now.
This pad sure didn't ***
No. It didn't.
There's absolutely no crater there at all from the engine.
No.
I wonder if about right under the engine is where the probe might have hit.
I'd like that.
Yes. I think that's a good representation of our sideward velocity at touchdown there - hole at the probe.
I see that probe over on the minus-Y strut. It's broken off and bent back up.
It did, didn't it? The other two both bent over.
Can't say too much for the visibility right here without the visor up. It's dark. It looks like there is a *** surface of it is *** pounded rock *** And incidentally, these rocks *** very powdery surface ***
Say again, please, Buzz; you're cutting out.
I say that the rocks are rather slippery.
Roger.
A powdery surface when the sun hits. *** they split up all the very little fine porouses *** Will tend to slide over it rather easily.
Traction *** seems quite good. ***
*** About to lose my balance in one direction and recovery is a quite natural and very easy *** And, moving your arms around, Jack, doesn't *** off the surface *** not quite that light-footed.
And, I have the insulation off the MESA now and MESA seems to be in good shape.
Got to be careful that you are leaning in the direction you want to go, otherwise you *** slightly inebriated. In other words, you have to cross your foot over to stay underneath where your center-of-mass is.
And, Neil, didn't I say we might see some purple rocks?
Find a purple rock?
Yes. They are small, sparkly *** fragments *** places *** would make a first guess that some sort of biotite *** We'll leave that to further analysis ***
*** compact underneath *** completely no *** you don't sink down more than ... a quarter of an inch.
Okay, Houston. I'm going to change lenses on you.
Roger, Neil.
Okay, Houston. Tell me if you're getting a new picture.
Neil, this is Houston. That's affirmative. We're getting a new picture. You can tell it's a longer focal length lens. And for your information, all LM systems are GO. Over.
We appreciate that. Thank you.
Neil is now unveiling the plaque *** gear.
Roger. We got you boresighted, but back under one track.
For those who haven't read the plaque, we'll read the plaque that's on the front landing gear of this LM. First there's two hemispheres, one showing each of the two hemispheres of the Earth. Underneath it says "Here Man from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace for all mankind." It has the crew members' signatures and the signature of the President of the United States.
Ready for the camera?
No. I'll get it. No, you take this TV on out.
Watch the LEC, there.
Now I'm afraid these ... materials are going to get dusty ***
The surface material is powdery. *** How good your lens is, but if you can *** smudges ... very much like a very finely powdered carbon, but it's very pretty looking.
Would you pull out some of my cable for me, Buzz?
Houston. How close are you able to get things in focus ?
This is Houston. We can see Buzz's right hand. It is somewhat out of focus. I'd say we were focusing down to probably - oh, about 8 inches to a foot behind the position of his hand when he was pulling out the cable.
Okay. How's the temperature on there?
Temperature of the camera is showing zero.
I'm a little cool. I think I'll trade ***
I'm on intermediate now, Houston, and I show 3.78. No flags, 70 ***
Houston. Roger. Out.
And, we'll probably need a little *** distance *** back location *** television camera.
Neil, look at the minus Y-strut, the direction of travel there *** travel from right to left.
Right.
This one over here underneath the ascent engine where the probe first hit - the minus-Y probe first hit.
I got plenty of cable?
You've got plenty. Plenty more.
Okay. I think I've got the end of it.
Something interesting: in the bottom of this little crater here - It may be -
Now keep going. We've got a lot more.
Okay.
Getting a little harder to pull out, here.
How far would you say I am, Buzz?
Forty, 50 feet. Why don't you turn around and let them get a view from there and see what the field of view looks like?
Okay.
You're backing into the cable.
Okay.
Turn around to your right, would be better.
I don't want to go into the Sun if I can avoid it.
That's right. Yes.
I'll just leave it - -
- - All right.
- - sit like that and walk around it.
Houston. How's that field of view going to pick up the MESA? *** far away?
Roger.
Neil, this is Houston. The field of view is okay. We'd like you to aim it a little bit more to the right. Over.
Okay.
Okay. That's all the cable we have. *** not going out. I'll start working on the solar wind - -
A little bit too much to the right. Can you bring it back left about 4 or 5 Degrees?
Okay. That looks good Neil.
Okay, now. Do you think I ought to be farther away, or closer?
Can't get too much further away.
Let's try it like that for a while. I'll get a couple of panoramas with it, here.
Roger. You look okay as far as distance goes, Neil. And we'll line you up again when you finish the panorama. Now you're going too fast on the panorama sweep. You're going to have to stop, or -
I haven't stopped - I haven't set it down yet. That's the first picture in the panorama. Right there.
Roger.
It's taken just a little - about north, north east.
Tell me if you've got a picture, Houston.
We've got a beautiful picture, Neil.
Okay. I'm going to move it.
Okay. Here's another good one.
Okay, we got that one.
Okay. Now, this one is right down front, straight west. And I want to know if you can see an angular rock in the foreground.
Roger. We have a large angular rock in the foreground, and it looks like a much smaller rock a couple of inches to the left of it. Over.
All right. And then on beyond it about 10 feet is an even larger rock that's very rounded. That rock is about - The closest one to you is about sticking out of the sand about 1 foot. And it's about a foot and one half long, and it's about 6 inches thick, but it's standing on edge.
Roger.
Okay, Neil. I've got the table out and the bag deployed.
We've got this view, Neil.
This is straight south.
Roger. And we see the shadow of the LM.
Roger. The little hill just beyond the shadow of the LM is a pair of elongate craters about - probably the pair together is about 40 feet long and 20 feet across, and they're probably 6 feet deep. We'll probably get some more work in there later.
Roger. We see Buzz going about his work.
How's that for a final?
For a final orientation, we'd like it to come left about 5 degrees. Over.
Now back to the right about half as much.
Okay?
Okay. That looks good there, Neil.
Okay.
Okay. You can make a Mark, Houston. *** deployed.
Roger. Solar wind.
And, incidently, you can use the shadow that the staff makes to *** getting it perpendicular ***
Roger.
Some of these small depressions *** tend to sink - oh, maybe 2 or 3 inches. *** suggest exactly what the Surveyor pictures showed when they pushed away a little bit. You get a force transmitted through the upper surface of the soil and about 5 or 6 inches of bay breaks loose and moves as if it were caked on the surface, when in fact it really isn't.
I noticed in the soft spots where we had footprints nearly an inch deep that the soil is very cohesive and it will retain a - will retain a slope of probably 70 degrees along side of the footprints.
Okay?
Yes. I think that's excellent.
They didn't come off?
*** get the ***
*** that part? *** a rock here.
You'll have to extend that one.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
***
Houston, Columbia on the high gain. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. Over.
Yes. Reading you loud and clear. How's it going?
Roger. The EVA is progressing beautifully. I believe they are setting up the flag now.
Great.
I guess you're about the only person around that doesn't have TV coverage of the scene.
That's all right. I don't mind a bit.
How is the quality of the TV?
Oh, it's beautiful, Mike. It really is.
Oh, gee, that's great! Is the lighting half way decent?
Yes, indeed. They've got the flag up now and you can see the stars and stripes on the lunar surface.
Beautiful. Just beautiful.
That's good. See if you can pull that end off a little bit. Take that end up a little.
It won't pull out.
Okay.
Neil, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Roger, Houston. Loud and clear.
Roger. Out.
Loud and clear, Houston.
Roger, Buzz.
I'd like to evaluate the various paces that a person can *** traveling on the lunar surface. I believe I'm out of your field of view. Is that right, now, Houston?
That's affirmative, Buzz.
You are in our field of view now.
Okay. You do have to be rather careful to keep track of where your center of mass is. Sometimes, it takes about two or three paces to make sure you've got your feet underneath you.
About two to three or maybe four easy paces can bring you to a nearly smooth stop. *** change directions, like a football player, you just have to to *** foot out to the side and cut a little bit.
So-called kangeroo hop does work, but it seems that your forward mobility is not quite as good as - it is in the conventional - more conventional one foot after another.
It's hard saying what a sane pace might be. I think it's the one that I'm using now - would get rather tiring after several hundred *** but this may be a function of this suit, as well as lack of gravity forces.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Could we get both of you on the camera for a minute, please?
Say again, Houston.
Roger. We'd like to get both of you in the field of view of the camera for a minute.
Neil and Buzz, the President of the United States is in his office now and would like to say a few words to you. Over.
That would be an honor.
Go ahead, Mr. President. This is Houston. Out.
Neil and Buzz, I am talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you *** for every American. This has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they, too, join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one; one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.
Thank you, Mr. President. It's a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the United States but men of peace of all nations, and with interest and a curiosity and a vision for the future. It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today.
And thank you very much and I look forward - All of us look forward to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday.
I look forward to that very much, sir.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Loud and clear, Houston.
Roger. I got a P22 AUTO optics - AUTO optics PAD for you.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. P22 landmark ID, LM: T1, 110 26 56; T2, 110 32 06. Three miles south; time of closest approach, 110 33 40. Shaft 353.855, trunnion 46.495, roll zero, pitch 250, yaw zero. Over.
Roger. Thank you. Readback not required.
Roger. Out.
Houston, it's very interesting to note that when I kick my foot *** with no atmosphere here, and this gravity *** they seem to leave, and most of them have about the same angle of departure and velocity. From where I stand, a large portion of them will impact at a certain distance out. Several *** the percentage is, of course, that will impact *** different regions *** it's highly dependent upon *** the initial trajectory upward *** where most of the *** already the particles are found, ... terrain.
Roger, Buzz. And break. Break. Columbia, this is Houston. When you track out of high gain antenna, then let's request OMNI Delta, OMNI Delta. Over.
So be it.
I've noticed several times in going from the sunlight into the shadow, that just as I go in, I catch an additional reflection off the LM *** along with the reflection off my face onto the visor, makes visibility very poor just at the transition *** sunlight into the shadow. I essentially have so much glare coming onto my visor *** shadow *** helmet actually gets the shadow. Than it takes a short while for my eyes to adapt to the lighting conditions. *** inside the shadow area, visibility, as we said before, is not too great, but both visor's up *** what sort of footprints we have and the general condition of the soil. Then, after being out in the sunlight a while, it takes - Watch it, Neil! Neil, you're on the cable.
Okay.
Yes. Lift up your right foot, right foot. It's still - your toe is still hooked in it.
That one?
Yes. It's still hooked in it. Wait a minute. Okay. You're clear now.
Thank you.
Now, let's move that over this way.
Okay. I've got it.
The blue color of my boots has completely disappeared now into this *** still don't know exactly what color to describe this other than ash cocoa color. It seems to be covering most of the lighter part of the boot *** color that *** very fine particles ***.
Buzz, this is Houston. You're cutting out on the end of your transmissions. Can you speak a little more closely into your microphone? Over.
Roger. I'll try that.
Beautiful.
Well, I had that one inside my mouth that time.
It sounded a little wet.
In general, time spent in the shadow doesn't seem to have any *** thermal effects. *** inside the suit. There is a difference, of course, in the ... radiation and the helmet. So I think there's a tendency to feel a little cooler in the shadow than the Sun.
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Columbia in Delta.
Roger. You should have VHF AOS with the LM right about now. VHF LOS will be about 40 minutes 15 seconds. Over.
Thank you.
As I look around the area, the contrast, in general, is *** comes about completely by virtue of the shadow *** down Sun ... very light colored gray, light gray color, a halo around my own shadow, around the shadow of my helmet. Then, as I look off across *** the contrast becomes strongest in that the surrounding color is still fairly light. As you look down into the Sun *** a larger amount of *** shadowed area is looking toward us. The general color of the *** surrounding *** the contrast is not as great. Surveying all the dusty area that we've kicked up *** considerably darker in texture. Now, I've kicked up one, and I imagine that this is *** Surveyor. The same is true when I survey across on - along the area that we're walking. In general *** to the fact that there are footprints there. General terrain where I've been kicking up a lot of this surface material is generally of a darker contrast *** color.
The panorama I'll be taking is about 30 or 40 feet out to plus ***
Say again which strut, Buzz?
The plus Z strut.
Roger.
And right in this area, there are two craters. The one that's right in front of me now as I look off in about the eleven o'clock position from the spacecraft, about 30 to 35 feet ... There's several eral rocks and boulders 6 to 8 inches across ... sizes.
I'm now in the area of the minus Y strut taking some ... photographs.
How's the bulk sample coming, Neil?
Bulk sample is just being sealed.
Houston, Columbia.
Columbia, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Roger. No marks on the LM that time. I did see a suspiciously small white object whose coordinates are - -
Go ahead with the coordinates on the small white object.
Easy - Easy 0.3, 7.6, but I ... right on the southwest end of a crater. I think they would know it if they were in such a location. It looks like their LM would be pitched up quite a degree. It's on the southwest wall of a smallish crater.
Roger. Copy Echo 0.3 and 7.6, and -
Columbia, this is Houston. While I'm talking to you, LOS will be at 111 19 31; AOS, 112 05 43. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Did you copy LOS AOS times? Over.
Negative, Houston. You broke. Disregard. I'll get them off the flight plans.
Roger. Out.
The jet deflector that's mounted on quad 1 seems to be a good bit more wrinkled *** right now on quad 4.
You're breaking up again, Buzz.
I say the jets deflector that's mounted on quad 4 seems to be - the surface of it seems lo be more wrinkled than the one that's on quad 1. Generally, underneath part of the LM seems to have stood up quite well to the *** get some pictures in the aft part of the LM that will illuminate the thermal effects much better than we could get them up here in the front.
Roger. Out.
We're going to get some particular photographs of the bulk sample area, Neil?
Okay.
And, Houston? Buzz here. I'm showing 3.78 psi, 63 percent, no flags, adequate, slight warming *** fingered.
Roger. And Neil has 66 percent O<sub>2</sub>, no flags, minimum cooling, and the suit pressure is 382.
Houston. Roger. Out.
Buzz, this is Houston. Have you removed the closeup camera from the MESA yet? Over.
Negative. Thank you.
*** get the panorama now. Okay.
Did you get it?
Houston, how does our timeline appear to be going?
Roger. It looks like you're about a half hour slow on it. We're working on consumables. Over.
All right.
Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. To clarify my last, your consumables are in good shape at this time. The 30 minute reference was with respect to the nominal timeline. Over.
Roger. I understand that.
I don't note any abnormalities in the LM. The pods seem to be in good shape. The primary and secondary struts are in good shape. Antennas are all in place. There's no evidence of problem underneath the LM due to engine exhaust or drainage of any kind.
Roger. Out.
It's very surprising, the very surprising lack of penetration of all four of the foot pads. I'd say if we were to try and determine just how far below the surface they would have penetrated, you'd measure maybe 3 inches, wouldn't you say, Neil?
At the most, yes. That Y strut there is probably even less than that.
Nice paint job.
I get a picture of the plus Y strut taken from near the descent stage, and I think we'll be able to see a little bit better what the thermal effects are. Seem to be quite minimal.
There's one picture taken in the right rear of the spacecraft looking at the skirt of the descent stage, shows a quite darkening of the surface color, a rather minimal amount of radiating or etching away or erosion of the surface. On descent, both of us remarked that we could see a large amount of very fine dust particles moving out. It was reported beforehand that we would probably see an upgassing from the surface after actual engine shutdown, but as I recall, I was unable to confirm that.
This is too big an angle, Neil.
Yes. I think you are right.
We're back at the minus Z strut now. *** very little force of impact that we actually had.
And, Neil, if you'll take the camera, I'll get to work on the SEQ bay.
Okay.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. I notice that -
Go ahead, Buzz.
Taking some close up pictures of that rock.
I was saying that, Houston, *** stop and take a photograph or something and then want to start moving again sideways, there's quite a tendency to start doing it with just gradual sideways hops until you start getting ***
Roger.
Can you see us underneath the LM over at the SEQ bay, Houston?
Yes indeed, Buzz. We can see your feet sticking our underneath the structure of the LM descent stage.
Okay. I'm just on the other side of the - -
Now we can see you through the structure of the minus Z secondary strut.
All right. The doors are open, and it looks like they are going to stay up without any problem.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We are about to lose you on the OMNI's. Request high gain antenna, REACQ mode Fish 20, yaw 135. Over.
You want to pick an area, Neil?
Make that yaw 175, Columbia, yaw 175 on the high gain.
Columbia is locked up on the high gain, Houston.
Roger. Out.
Houston, the passive seismometer has been deployed manually.
Roger.
And the manual deployment of the LR cubed, the little spring that is at the end of the string is pulled off of the picks head. However, I was able to reach up and get hold of the picks head and pull it loose. So, it will be deployed manually, also.
Roger.
And, the panorama is complete. *** and the LM - got the LM at 7 30 position at about 60 feet.
And the doors are closed and locked.
Roger.
Have you got us a good area picked out?
Yes. I think right out on that rise out there is probably as good as any.
I'll probably stay on the high ground there and - -
Watch it; the edge of that crater is - drops - -
Yes. It drops off there, doesn't it?
Get a couple of close ups on these quite rounded large boulders.
About 40 feet out - I'd say out at the end of that next - -
It's going to be a little difficult to find a good level spot here.
The top of that next little ridge there. Wouldn't that be a pretty good place?
All right. Should I put the LR cubed right about here?
All right.
I'm going to have to get on the other side of this rock here.
I would go right around that crater to the left there. Isn't that a level spot there?
I think this right here is just as level.
These boulders look like basalt, and they have probably 2 percent white minerals in them, the white crystals. And the thing that I reported as the vesicular before, I'm not - I don't believe I believe that any more. I think that small craters - they look like little impact craters where shot - B B shot has hit the surface.
Houston. I have the seismic experiment flipped over now, and I'm aligning it, but I'm having a little bit of difficulty getting the B B in the center. It wants to move around and around on the outside. ***
You're cutting out again, Buzz.
Roger. I say I'm not having too much success in leveling the PSE experiment.
The laser reflector is installed and the bubble is leveled and the alignment appears to be good.
Neil, this is Houston. Roger. Out.
Hey, you want to take a look at this B B and see what you make out of it?
I find it pretty hard to get perfectly level, too.
That B B likes the outside. It won't go on the inside.
That little cup is convex now, instead of concave.
I think you're right.
Believe it is.
Houston, I don't think there's any hope for using this leveling device to come up with an accurate level. It looks to me as though the cup here that the B B is in is now convex instead of concave. Over.
Roger, 11. Press on. If you think it looks level by eyeball, go ahead.
Okay.
...
There you go. Good work; good show. Hey, whoa; stop, stop! Back up.
Houston, as I was spacing the PSE, the right hand solar array deployed automatically. The left hand I had to manually *** the bar at the far end.
All parts of the solar array are clear of the ground now.
Buzz, this is Houston. I understand that you did successfully deploy both solar arrays. Over.
Roger. That's affirmative. And there isn't any way of telling whether that's lined up. I'm getting in the way; maybe I can get down here.
Neil, how does that appear to be pointing?
Neil, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We've been looking at your consumables, and you're in good shape. Subject to your concurrence, we'd like to extend the duration of the EVA 15 minutes from nominal. We will still give Buzz a hack at 10 minutes for heading in. Your current elapsed time is 2 plus 12. Over.
Okay. That sounds fine.
Roger. Out.
Buzz, this is Houston. If you're still in the vicinity of the PSE, could you get a photograph of the ball level? Over.
I'll do that, Buzz.
Right. We'll get a photograph of that. Houston, what time would you estimate we could allow for the documented sample? Over.
Oh, shoot. Would you believe the ball is right in the middle now?
Wonderful. Take a picture before it moves.
Neil, this is Houston. We're estimating about 10 minutes for the documented sampling. Over.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Columbia.
Roger. Like you to terminate charging battery Bravo at 111 plus 15. Over.
How about right now?
Roger.
Buzz, this is Houston. You've got about 10 minutes left now prior to commencing your EVA termination activities. Over.
Roger. I understand.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. The passive seismic experiment has been uncaged and we're observing short period oscillations in it. Over.
I hope you're watching how hard I have to hit this into the ground, to the tune of about 5 inches, Houston.
Roger.
It almost looks wet.
Got a sample.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, you cut the cable again.
All right, Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. We'd like you to - -
...
That clear?
Not quite.
Neil, this is Houston. We'd like you all to get two core tubes and the solar wind experiment; two core tubes and the solar wind. Over.
Roger.
Okay. While I'm getting the next one, maybe you can - ... away the box a little bit.
...
Buzz, this is Houston. You have approximately 3 minutes until you must commence your EVA termination activities. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Columbia, this is Houston. Approximately 1 minute to LOS. Over.
Columbia. Roger.
And, do you plan on commencing your sleep on the backside this pass? If so, we'll disable uplink to you while we're talking to the LM. Over.
Negative that.
Houston, were you able to record the documentary way where the two core tube samples were taken?
Negative. Out.
I didn't get a stereopair of those two, but they are right in the vicinity of the solar wind.
Neil, this is Houston. After you've got the core tubes and the solar wind, anything else that you can throw into the box would be acceptable.
Righto.
Cap ...
I got the cap.
Got the cap?
They're both good caps on ...
Okay.
And, you want to pick up some stuff, and I'll - -
Get these aseptic ones.
- - Move the solar wind in.
Buzz, this is Houston. It's about time for you to start your EVA closeout activities.
Roger. That's in progress.
Neil and Buzz, this is Houston. We'd like to remind you of the closeup camera magazine before you start up the ladder, Buzz.
Okay. Got that over with you, Neil?
No, the closeup camera's underneath the MESA. I'll have to pick it up with the prong. I'm picking up several pieces of really vesicular rock out here, now.
You didn't get anything in those environmental samples, did you?
Not yet.
Well, I don't think we'll have time.
Roger, Neil and Buzz. Let's press on with getting the closeup camera magazine and closing out of the sample return container. We're running a little low on time.
Roger.
Okay. Can you quickly stick this in my pocket, Neil, and I'll head on up the ladder?
Okay.
I'll hold it. You open the packet up.
... that'd kill us. Just hold it right there. Okay. Let the pocket go.
About through?
Got it.
Okay. Adios, amigo.
Okay.
Anything more before I head on up, Bruce?
Negative. Head on up the ladder, Buzz.
How are you coming, Neil?
Okay.
Did you get that solar wind rolled up there, Buzz?
Right. That's it right there.
Okay.
Think you can reach the - reach this hook that's hanging over here? You might entertain the idea of sending up the second one that way.
Okay.
Get the film off of that.
I will. Get that up now.
Okay. I'm heading on in.
Okay.
And I'll get the LEC all ready for the rock box.
Neil, this is Houston. Did the Hasselblad magazine go up on that sample return container also?
I've got the Hasselblad magazine hooked to the SRC now, yes.
Roger.
How are you doing, Buzz?
I'm okay.
About ready to send up the LEC?
Yes. Just about.
Okay.
Okay. That's got it clear.
Oh. Uh - oh. The camera came off. I mean the film pack came off.
Okay. Just ease it down now. Don't pull so hard on it. All right, let it go.
While you're getting that, I've got to get the camera.
Okay. This - This one's in. No problem.
Okay. Stand by a second.
Neil, this is Houston. Request an EMU check. Over.
Roger. Got 3.8 and I got 54 on the O<sub>2</sub> and no flags, and my flow is in N.
Neil and Buzz, for your information, your consumables remain in good shape. Out.
Roger, How's it coming, Neil?
Okay. I've got one side hooked up to the second box and I've got the film pack on.
Okay. Good.
Boy, that bilge from on the LEC is kind of falling all over me while I'm doing this.
All that soot, huh?
That's what it looks like down here.
I think my watch stopped, Neil.
Did it?
No, it didn't either. Second hand.
Okay. If you can just kind of hold it, why, I think I can do the pulling.
Okay. Stand by a minute. Let me move back.
Okay. Easy. All right, easy in the hatch now.
Okay. I'll get it the rest of the way. And I'll give it to you to - No, wait, just a second. Yes, a little more.
Buzz?
Okay. It's unhooked.
How about that - package out of your - brief. Get that?
No.
Okay. I'll get it when I get up there.
... now?
...
Okay?
Okay.
Neil, this is Houston. Did you get the Hasselblad magazine?
Yes, I did. And we got about, I'd say, 20 pounds of carefully selected, if not documented, samples.
Houston. Roger. Well done. Out.
...
Just keep your head down close. Now start arching your back. That's good. Plenty of room. Now, all right, arch your back a little, your head up against *** Roll right just a little bit. Head down. ... in good shape.
Thank you. Am I bumping now?
No, you're clear. You're rubbing up against me a little bit.
Okay?
*** All right. That's right. A bit to the left. Okay. Now move your foot, and I'll get the hatch.
Okay.
Okay. The hatch is closed and latched, and verified secure.
Okay. Now we turn the feedwater valve - CLOSED. And I got your PLSS antenna ...
Okay. Feedwater valve's CLOSED.
And your antenna's ...
Okay.
...
Okay. That's out. ... I did my part ... Okay.
...
This is Houston. Go ahead.

Roger, Columbia on Charlie. How do you read?
Roger, Columbia. This is Houston. Reading you loud and clear on OMNI Charlie. The crew of Tranquility Base is back inside their base, repressurized, and they're in the process of doffing the PLSS's. Everything went beautifully. Over.
Hallelujah.
And we'd like to get P00 and ACCEPT from you. We have a state vector uplink. And, after that, we'd like you to realign your platform to the new REFSMMAT that we sent up a REV or two ago. Over.
Roger. Understand. You want a option 1, P52 option 1.
Columbia, this is Houston. We're going to uplink you a new state vector, and then we'll send the REFSMMAT up again, because sending the state vector up will wipe out the one that you have on board; and then you can do a P52 option 1. Over.
P52.

Roger, Tranquility. We'd like to hold off as long as possible on the lithium hydroxide canister. Make that one of the last things you do in getting ready for the DEPRESS, if you can. Over.
Roger. We're planning on doing that. I was just wondering how much longer we want to wait, though. We've probably got another half an hour's worth of picture taking, and I guess we could run through an eat cycle and then change the canister, and then DEPRESS. Over.
Roger. That sounds fine to us.
Well, it'll be a little crowded in here for a while.
Well, we don't mind a bit.
Houston, Columbia. You got the new coordinates?
Columbia. This is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Have you got the new coordinates for me?
Roger. Latitude 00.691 - that would be plus 00.691 - and longitude over 2 is plus 11.713. The altitude is minus 1.44 nautical miles. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Columbia, this is Houston. On latitude, make that plus 00.692, rounding off. Over.
Okay.
Okay. I read back plus 00.692, plus 11713, and minus 00144. And you have a grid square for me?
Roger. Standby.
Columbia. This is Houston. Grid coordinates: Kilo 0.9, 6.3, on LAM 2. Over.
Kilo 0.9 and 6.3. Thank you. One of these grid squares is about as much as you can scan on a single pass.
Roger.
And for your information, Columbia, you're approaching the VHF line of site COMM limit with Tranquility Base. LOS will be at 38 minutes plus 25 seconds. Over.
Roger.
Roger. And we've had to disable the one way MSFN relay owing to a ground site reconfiguration down here. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Columbia. ...
This is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
Roger. I can't see them.
Roger. I guess that takes care of the news for today, Mike.
All right. Roger.
You might be interested in knowing, Mike, that we have gotten reflections back from the laser reflector ray they deployed, and we may be able to get some information out of that a little later.
Roger. I need a very precise position, because I can only do a decent job of scanning maybe one of those grid squares at a time. The area that we've been sweeping covers 10's and 20's and 30's of them.
Roger. We understand. This is intended to be your last P22. We don't want to use up too much fuel in this effort. Over.
Roger. How's the fuel coming?
Roger. There's no problem fuel wise. It's just that there seems to be a limit to the number of P22's and the number of grid squares you can search over.
Roger. Well, I'll continue this maneuver then to roll 82, pitch 218, yaw zero, if that's okay with you, and do a P52 in that attitude. And that'll be a sleep ...
Roger. That's fine with us. And P52 in that attitude.
Roger. A P52 and then the sleep attitude.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Tranquility Base. Go ahead.
Roger. When you all have a free moment, I have your T8 through T12 block data. Over.
Roger. Stand by one.
Houston, Tranquility Base. Ready to copy.
Roger, Tranquility. T8, 114 30 57; T9, 116 29 10; T10, 118 27 23; T11, 120 25 36; T12, 122 23 49. Readback. Over.
Roger. T8, 114 30 57; T9, 116 29 10; T10, 118 27 23; T11, 120 25 36; T12, 122 23 49. Over.
Readback correct. Houston out.
Houston. Columbia.
Houston, Columbia on high gain.
Houston, Tranquility Base.
Columbia. Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Columbia in the high gain.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear on the high gain, Columbia.
Roger. Going to P52 attitude. You want a crew status report?
Say again, Columbia?
I say again, I am maneuvering to the P52 attitude, and do you want a crew status report?
Roger. And go ahead with your crew status report.
Roger. No medication. Radiation 100.16.
Houston. We copy.
Houston, Tranquility Base.
Go ahead, Tranquility.
Roger. The weight of the RCU was 12 ounces. That was by itself without the bag, and the weight of the water from the CDR's PLSS was 12 1/2 ounces. That's reading zero with the bag on.
This is Houston. We copy. And, for your information, the new LM weight after jettison of equipment including lithium hydroxide canister is 10837. Over.
Okay. 10837.
Houston, Columbia. Did you copy the P52?
Columbia, this is Houston. Affirmative.
Okay.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. In the flight plan configuration, we show that the stability control circuit breaker ATCA on panel 16 should be open at this time. Over.
Houston, Tranquility. Say again which one should be closed?
Roger. Panel 16, row 2, STAB control ATCA, that is A T C A, and it should be open at this time. Over.
Roger. Coming open.
Roger. Out.
Housquin - Houston, Tranquility. Do you have a way of showing the configuration of the engine arm circuit breaker? Over. The reason I'm asking is because the end of it appears to be broken off. I think we can push it back in again. I'm not sure we could pull it out if we pushed it in, though. Over.
Roger. We copy. Stand by please.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Our telemetry shows the engine arm circuit breaker in the OPEN position at the present time. We want you to leave it open until it is nominally scheduled to be pushed in, which is later on. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Tranquility Base. The CDR's PRD reads 11014.
Roger. 11014 for the CDR.
Roger. LMP reads 09018. Over.
Roger. 09018.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Bruce. When you get a few minutes could you give me some words on tomorrow's activities - when they're going to start?
Roger.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Mike. Couple of quick flight plan update here. First off, we'd like to get an O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge at time 113 30. You - Are you copying? Over.
Roger. And copy.
Secondly, we will return to the nominal timeline with your scheduled wakeup of 121 hours and 12 minutes. We sort of slipped by lithium hydroxide canister change number 9 during the EVA and EVA PREP. We'd like you to accomplish that now. The COMM for sleep will be the normal lunar COMM configuration, the RCS configuration. We're requesting you use quads Alfa and Bravo. A DAP data load for R2 should be 01111. Readback. Over.
Roger. Oxygen fuel cell purge at 113 30. Return to the nominal timeline at 121 hours wakeup. Lithium hydroxide change number 9 right now. Normal lunar COMM sleep configuration, I'm in that now. On the RCS, I understood before you wanted to load the DAP register 2 011000 which made sense, and then later to pitch only on quad A, enable all on quad B, and C and D off. But you don't want to do that any more, huh?
Columbia. This is Houston. On your DAP load in R2, we're requesting a 0 an four 1's, that is, 01111. Over
Okay.
And you - -
Load's going in right now.
Roger. And you'll be enabling quads Alfa and Bravo on the AUTO RCS select switches. Disable Charlie and Delta.
All right.
And we have a little less than 2 minutes to LOS. If you're still up, AOS next time around will be 114 04. Over.
Roger.
And, Columbia, if it's agreeable with you, we'd like you to stay awake until we have one successful reacquisition on the high gain antenna. And I guess you can plan on turning in shortly after AOS this next pass. Over.
Okay.
Roger. Out.
Tranquility Base, Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
Go ahead. Houston.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear. Just wanted to make sure we still had COMM.
Roger. We just finished up - we're just finishing up our eat period. Be ready to go back into PREP for DEPRESS.
Roger.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. On your next depressurization, it's acceptable to use the overhead hatch dump valve in addition to or instead of the forward hatch dump valve to speed up the depressurization of the cabin. I have a T13 update for you, and if you could, sometime here, give us P00 and DATA; we'll uplink you a new CSM state vector. Over.
All right.
You've got the DSKY.
Roger. Your T13 time is 124 22 02. Over.
Roger. It's T13, 124 22 - is that 02? Over.
That's affirmative. That is 02. And do you have a time estimate for us until you're ready to start cabin DEPRESS? Over.
Fifteen minutes, maybe?
Roger.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Uplink complete. The computer's yours, and you can go out of DATA.
Roger.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
Go ahead. Tranquility Base, here.
Roger. Just want to let you guys know that since you're an hour and a half over your timeline and we're all taking a day off tomorrow, we're going to leave you. See you later.
I don't blame you a bit.
That's a real great day, guys. I really enjoyed it.
Thank you. You couldn't have enjoyed it as much as we did.
Roger.
It was great.
Sure wish you'd hurry up and get that trash out out of there, though.
Yes. We're just about to do it.
Okay.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. We show the suit relief valve still in the AUTO position. It should be closed. Over.
Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Go ahead.
Roger. We've successfully reacquired high gain antenna. Unless you have some other traffic with us, I guess we'll bid you a good night and let you get some sleep, Mike. Over.
Okay. Sounds fine.
And we're going to power down the voice subcarrier part of our uplink to you in order that we don't disturb you while we're talking to Tranquility Base. If you need us, just give us a call, and we can respond with a time lag of about a minute to a minute and a half in setting reconfigured. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger. And good night.
Good night, Bruce. Thanks a lot.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. We'd like you to ENABLE the thrusters in Bravo 1 and Bravo 2, AUTO RCS SELECT. Over.
Okay. Bravo 1 and Bravo 2 ENABLE.
Roger. Out.
Tranquility, this is Houston. For a reference, which dump valve are you using? Over.
We used the forward dump valve until about 2 psi, and we're using the overhead now.
Roger. Out.
They're both - they're both open now.
Houston, Tranquility Base. REPRESS complete.
Roger, Tranquility. We observed your equipment jettison on the TV, and the passive seismic experiment recorded shocks when each PLSS hit the surface. Over.
You can't get away with anything anymore, can you?
No, indeed.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. When you get back into your surface checklist and come over to the COMM reconfiguration on page Surface 45, we'd like you to enable the ranging feature on your S band. That is, when you come down to S band configuration, instead of CAUTION and WARNING ELECTRONICS, ENABLE TV, we'd like you to go into the RANGE position and leave it there for as long as you conveniently can until you get ready to commence your rest period; and we'll try to get a little more ranging data on you. Over.
Roger. Copy.
And of course, when you get ready to turn in, go back into caution and warning, ENABLE, and we'd like to say from all of us down here in Houston and really from all of us in all the countries and in the entire world, we think that you've done a magnificent job up there today. Over.
Thank you very much.
It's been a long day.
Yes, indeed. Get some rest there and have at it tomorrow.
Houston, Tranquility. Did you all come up with any other solution that we might try to the mission timer problem? Over.
Stand by, Tranquility. We'll be back with you in just a minute.
And, Houston, Tranquility. Have you had enough TV for today?
Tranquility, this is Houston. Yes, indeed. It's been a mighty fine presentation there.
Okay. Signing off. See you again tomorrow.
Roger.
Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Sorry to bother you, Columbia. Two things: we request that you select 10 degree deadband in your DAP in accordance with the procedures on Foxtrot 9 7 in your checklist; and secondly, we'd like to leave a display on the DSKY that is not one that's cycling, being continuously updated. What you have when you get through widening the deadband will be a static display, and that'll be satisfactory. Over.
Okay.
Roger. Goodnight again.
Tranquility Base, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. On your mission timer, we wanted to pull the circuit breaker and let it cool down for an hour and a half to 2 hours. I believe the breaker is currently open. It has been off, so go ahead and reset the mission timer circuit breaker. Put the timer control to RESET and hold it in RESET for 30 seconds, and then slew it to your desired settings left to right, and place the timer control to START. Over.
Okay. We'll try it.
Houston, our mission timer seems to be slewing okay. You want to give us a time hack? Or can we get it off the CMC   LGC, I mean?
Roger, Tranquility. I'll give you a time hack at 114 31 00. It's about 30 seconds from now. Over.
Stand by for a Mark at 114 31.
Okay. ... you.
Stand by.
MARK.
Tranquility, this is Houston. Did you copy my Mark at 114 31?
Roger. Thank you, and our mission timer is running now.
Roger. Very good. And, I've got a consumables update for you if you're ready to copy or listen. Over.
Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. RCS Alfa is 81 percent, RCS Bravo 75 percent. Coming up on 115 hours GET, descent oxygen is 31.8 pounds or 59 percent; descent amp hours 858, and ascent amp hours 574. Over.
Roger. Copy. Thank you very much.
Roger. Out.
Tranquility, this is Houston. We also have a set of about 10 questions relating to observations you made, things you may have seen during the EVA. You can either discuss a little later on this evening or sometime later in the mission at your option. How do you feel? Over.
I guess we can take them up now.
Okay. And your friendly Green Team here has pretty well been relieved by your friendly Maroon Team, and I'll put Owen on with the questions.
Tranquility - -
Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Go ahead.
Tranquility, Houston. First question here is how your best estimate of the yaw on the - of the LM as compared to the nominal preflight plan. Over.
We got 13 degrees left on the ball, and I think that's probably about right. Looking at the shadow and so on, we prob - probably about 13 degrees left of the shadow.
Roger. That's 13 degrees left of the shadow. And, next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near the first part of the EVA and any changes in composition that you might have observed during the bulk sampling interval. Over.
I'm not sure I understand that question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizable number of selected rock fragments of different types.
Roger, Neil. One of the implications here is the depth from which the bulk sample was collected. Did you manage to get down there several inches or nearer the surface? Over.
We got some down from as much as 3 inches in the area where I was looking at variation with depth in the bulk sample. There really wasn't appreciable difference, and I didn't run into any hard bed. Later on, or at some other times and other areas, why, I'd get down just a short distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further.
Roger. Believe we understand down as deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition to that depth. Next question, the - the second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time limitation, and wonder if you would be able to provide any more detailed description of the samples which were included in the second SRC. Over.
We got two core tubes and solar wind and about half of the big sample bag full of assorted rocks which I picked up hurriedly from around the area. I tried to get as many representative types as I could.
Roger, Neil. Next topic here relates to the rays which emanate from the DPS engine burning area. We're wondering if the rays emanating from the - beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding surface. Over.
The ones that I saw back in the aft end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker; of course, viewed from the aft end, why, they did have the Sun shining directly on them. It seemed as though the material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction, but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet, from the skirt of the engine. Over.
Roger. Understand that near the aft end out to the east that the rays did appear darker. I understand, Buzz, that these were - this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending outward. Is that correct?
No. I wouldn't say it was necessarily material that had been uncovered. I think some of the material might have been baked or in some way caused to be more cohesive and perhaps flow together in some way, I don't know. Now, in other areas, before we started trampling around out front, why, we could see that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant mark on the surface other than just having eroded it away. Now, it was different back in the - right under the skirt itself. It seems as though the surface had been baked in a streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show this. But that didn't extend out very far. Over.
Roger, Tranquility. And this baked appearance that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due to the heat of the engine at any rate. Next subject, did - -
I believe so.
Roger. Next subject, did either of the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the Moon during deployment? Over.
I think that two corners did touch, since when it was deployed, both of them didn't come out at the same time. It unfolded a little unevenly, and of course, the terrain that it was on was a little bit - not quite as level as it was - as I would like to have it. And I think that two corners did touch to about 1 inch - no, three quarters to a half an inch deep; and maybe along the bottom, it might have been maybe 3 inches, leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners; and I think these are on the western ones. Over.
Roger. Understand the description there. And the next subject, on the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect these tubes compare? Was there any difference? Over
Not significantly. I could get down to about the first 2 inches without much of a problem, and then as I would pound it in about as hard as I could do it, and the second one took two hands on the hammer, and I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod, and it just wouldn't go much more than - I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches. But even there, it didn't - For some reason it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. In other words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't - just penetrate in a way that would support it and keep it from falling over, if that makes any sense at all. It didn't really to me. Over.
Roger, Buzz. I think I've got the picture. You indicate that little difference between the two samples and that in each case you got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continue hammering rather vigorously in order to continue driving it in to a total depth of 8 or 9 inches, and even at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on you even after pounding in that far. Is that correct?
Yes. That's about it. It wasn't a rapid change in resistive force. And also I noticed when I took the bit off that the material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it - The way it adhered to the core tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. Over.
Roger. Understand the general impression of being moist as it packed in the core tube. Next question: we did copy your comments prior to the EVA of your general description of the area. We wonder if either of you would have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary of the geology of the area. Over.
Yes let's - we'll - We'll postpone our answer to that one until tomorrow. Okay?
Yes, indeed. That'll be fine. Just a couple more here, and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. Can you estimate the stroke of the primary and secondary struts? Over.
Well, I could do it like this, Owen. About all the struts are about equally stroked, and the height from the ground to the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 and 1/2 feet, huh?
Roger. Understand, Neil. Next topic, as - just after landing, you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus Z axis from the LM. Are there any large rocks in that direction that might block the solar ray during the sunset - as sunset approaches in your locality - Are there any large rocks that might tend to obscure the ray? Over.
No. I don't believe so, I think that it's - It's about as level as any other areas that we chose.
Roger. I - -
There's nothing large, anyway, that's going to get in the way.
Roger. Copy. That's also the way it appeared from the television, I think. And now the final question. You commented, Neil, that on your approach to the landing spot, you had passed over a football field sized crater containing rather large blocks of solid rock perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size. Can you estimate the distance to this football sized crater from your present position? Over.
I thought we'd be close enough so that when we got outside we could see its rim back there but I couldn't. But I don't think that we're more than a half mile beyond it. That is a half mile west of it.
Roger. So you estimate your present position less than half a mile approximately west of this large crater. Over.
That's correct.
Okay. Well, that takes care of the questions from our geologists for tonight, and unless you have something else, that'll be all for - from us for the evening. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Tranquility Base, Houston. We've now collected all the ranging data that we can use, and you can go back to caution and warning ENABLE. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Two more verifications, here. Can you - will you verify that the disk with messages was placed on the surface as planned, and also that the items listed in the flight plan - all of those listed there were jettisoned. Over.
That's - All that's verified.
Roger. Thank you, and I hope this will be a final good night.
Okay.
Columbia, Columbia, good morning from Houston.
Hi, Ron.
Hey, Mike, how's it going this morning?
How goes it?
Hey, real fine. While you're - -
I don't know yet, how's it going with you?
Real fine here. Columbia, request P00 and ACCEPT. We'll shove the state vector in for you right away.
Okay. It's coming up now, Columbia. We're going to keep you a little busy here. As soon as we get the state vector in, we'd like you to go ahead and do a P52 option 3 on this night pass, and then when you come on around the other side there, we'll give you some landmark tracking information on prime 130.
Okay.
And for your information, we're also going to have Tranquility Base do a P52 when you come around the other time; and I have the P22 information if you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Okay. Track landmark 130 prime using P22, and for information, this will properly position your rendezvous radar transponder. T1 is 122 plus 16 plus 05 - whoops, okay. Stand by.
Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours.
Okay. And I'd like the grid square of this crater 130 prime. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Say again about 130 prime.
I'd like its grid square, please.
Roger. Stand by.
Columbia, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I have the T1 and T2 times and also the longitude of the 130 prime. We're working on the grid squares and we'll get them shortly.
Okay. Ready to copy.
Okay. T1: 122 plus 16 plus 05. Tango 2 is 122 plus 21 plus 11, and 6 miles north of track. And do you want your NOUN 89 values?
Yes, please.
Roger. Latitudes, plus 01.243. Longitude over 2, plus 11.844. Altitude, minus 001.46. Over.
Copy T1: 122 16 05. T2: 122 21 11, 6 miles north, NOUN 89 is plus 01243, plus 11844, minus 00146.
Columbia, affirmative. And at the T1 time, put your rendezvous radar transponder switch to OPERATE.
All right.
And this 130 prime is the same one that you tracked prior to descent. Over.
Okay. You've updated your information as to the LM's position and this is your best estimate of where the LM is, is that correct?
Columbia, that's negative. This 130 is the little bitty crater there that you tracked - John Young's crater - that you tracked prior to descent. And we want that - -
Fine. Okay. You've given up looking for that.
Affirmative. We want this for one last fix on your plane.
All right. Fine. Understand. Thank you.
And when the LM does his P22 on your transponder, well then, that'll be our last shot at the LM's position.
Roger. Understand. Do you care whether my transponder is on before T1?
Roger. It'll be on WARMUP prior to that time, and you can go to OPERATE anywhere around that time.
Yes. I gather it's on its 24 minute warmup now?
Roger.
And, Houston. The computer is yours, you can go to BLOCK anytime.
Roger. BLOCK, going P52, option 3.
Roger. And we'll see you coming around the other side. About 1 minute to go, and all your systems are looking good.
Thanks, Ron.
Tranquility Base, Tranquility Base, Houston. Over.
Good morning, Houston. Tranquility Base. Over.
Roger. Loud and clear. And how is the resting standing up there. Did you get a chance to curl up on the engine can?
Roger. Neil has rigged himself a really good hammock with a waste tether, and he's been lying on the ascent engine cover, and I curled up on the floor. Over.
Roger. Copy, Buzz. Got a couple of changes to your surface checklist here, and in general, what we're going to want you to do is P22, tracking the command module for one last hack on your position there. And this will be - in other words, P57, P22, and then to press on with the checklist, and the rest of them are a couple of minor changes in the checklist. The main one being that we do not want the rendezvous radar on during the ascent, and we think that this will take care of some of the overflow of program alarms which we're getting during descent.
Okay. We had the rendezvous radar in SLEW during descent, though.
Tranquility Base, Houston. I missed that. Say again.
Roger. I say again. We had the rendezvous radar switch in the SLEW position, not the LGC position.
Roger. We copy that. But there's a greater duty cycle on - There's a good 15 percent duty cycle on the ascent program there, so just go ahead and leave it off. And I have the changes there if you want to get out your surface checklist, and I can go ahead and start giving them to you.
All right. Go ahead. I've got it out.
Okay. Before we start here, request P00 and DATA, and we'll give you some vectors.
Now you've got P00 and DATA.
Okay. And on Surface 50 will be the first change there.
Okay. And I understand you want us to do a P57 option 3 and then a P22, is that the general idea? Over.
That's affirmative. So on Surface 50 there, down at the bottom of the page, just after PRO after two recycles, stick in a time of 122 plus 15; do P22 as per PGNS 20 of G&N dictionary. Over.
Roger. Understand that's 122 15, do P22 as per PGNS 20, G&N dictionary.
Roger. Okay. Let's skip on over to Surface 59.
Okay.
Okay. This is going to be for one last vent on the DPS tank there, so at the top of the page just after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add - Okay, after EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSE, add PROP DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT CLOSE, and then after STABILIZATION/CONTROL AELD, CLOSE, add PROP DISPLAYS/ENGINE OVERRIDE/LOGIC, CLOSE. Over.
Roger. Copy. These are two circuit breakers, right?
Tranquility Base, affirmative. Those are just the circuit breakers at that time.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Did you get those two on the propulsion circuit breakers?
Roger. I have those two.
Okay. Let's go over to Surface 60, and then down the middle of the page, after launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, then I add the switches there.
Roger. Go ahead then.
Okay. After launch guidance system recommendation from MSFN, add DESCENT PROPULSION FUEL VENT, OPEN; add DESCENT PROPULSION OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; add verify talkback gray. Over.
Roger. DESCENT PROPELLANT FUEL VENT, OPEN; DESCENT PROPELLANT OXIDIZER VENT, OPEN; verify talkback gray.
Roger. You got that one, so that'll be the last vent and it will continue venting. Skip over to Surface 61 down there at TIG minus 17.
Roger. I'm there. Go ahead.
Okay, at TIG minus 17, delete CB (11). AC Bus A, RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE, wait 30 seconds; delete PGNS: RENDEZVOUS RADAR, CLOSE; and then add UP DATA LINK switch to VOICE BACKUP. Over
Roger. I have that. We'll leave those two circuit breakers open, and have the UP DATA LINK to VOICE BACKUP; and we'll make the appropriate changes on the following circuit breaker status card.
Roger. And then you might add a little note down there at the bottom of the page - Note: - This is at the bottom of page 61 - Note: Do not use tape meter in PGNS, i.e., do not place MODE SELECT switch to PGNS. Over.
Okay. We'll put it in AGS.
Roger. Fair enough. That's some more of that computer load business.
Okay. That's all the changes we have for the checklist here. I've got some - just some general notes, I'll read to you on P22, and just for some information. Over.
Okay. Then it looks to me like we ought to get hopping on this P57.
Roger. We agree wholeheartedly. And while you're starting on that, I'll read - just read these notes on P22. Call P22 possible program alarm 5.6, range greater than 400 nautical miles, and then use the P22 as described on PGNS 20. Take option 1 in NOUN 06, and use the no update mode. The rendezvous radar will lock on at about 25 degrees elevation above the horizon. If 503 alarm occurs, designate fail. Key a PROCEED and allow the rendezvous radar to search for the CSM. And place the range altitude monitor switch in altitude/altitude rate to prevent the tape meter from driving into the stops. And press on.
Roger. I think I have that.
Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.
Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.
Houston, Columbia.
Roger, Columbia. We'd like a CRYO stir in all four tanks and the standard 1 minute. Over.
In work.
Roger. And do you have any torquing angles from the P52?
Roger. Stand by one.
Tranquility, Houston. Request ERROR RESET at this time. Over.
Roger. ERROR RESET, and would you tell me when you're satisfied with the LGC self test?
Tranquility, LGC is a GO.
Roger.
Torquing angles when you're ready.
Columbia, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Stars 25 and 42; angle difference 5 balls; NOUN 93, plus 00165, plus 00186, minus 00039, time of torquing 121 15. Over.
Columbia, Houston. We copy. Thank you.
And CRYO stir complete.
Roger. Thank you, Columbia.
Houston, Tranquility. Would you like a recycle on the VERB 6 04? Over.
Tranquility, Houston, We copy. Stand by one.
Tranquility, Houston. Request recycle.
Houston, Columbia. My rendezvous radar transponder is operating.
Spacecraft calling Houston? Say again.
This is Columbia saying the rendezvous radar transponder is operating.
Roger. Copy, Columbia.
Tranquility, Houston. Request rendezvous radar breakers in about now.
Columbia, Houston. Request OMNI D - OMNI Delta.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Request you go ahead and start the warmup on the rendezvous radar.
Roger.
Houston, you copying NOUN 93?
Tranquility, affirmative. Go.
Roger. We're going to a torque.
Houston. Roger.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Columbia will be overhead at 122 plus 22 plus 51. His LOS will be 29 35. Over.
Roger.
Houston, we'd like to check this on the tape meter against the AGS. We'll go back to altitude - altitude rates as soon as the rate starts to build up. Over.
Tranquility, Houston. Roger.
On second thought, since that will peg the range rate, I guess maybe we'd better not do that. And for this range that the AGS are showing now, 425 miles with a signal strength of 2.2. It looks like we ought to proceed on this. Over.
Roger. Stand by one. Tranquility, affirmative. Proceed.
Are you getting the information on the downlink now?
Tranquility, affirmative, and we're saving it. We've got 4 so far, and it's looking good.
Okay. What do you people think about calling up a VERB 83?
Tranquility, Houston. Stand by on that now. We're getting the data now. We're checking on the VERB 83.
And we expect that we may lose lock when it passes overhead because of the MAX rate that the radar has.
Tranquility, Houston. Negative on VERB 83.
Understand.
We just lost lock.
Tranquility, Houston. Go.
They've just lost lock, Ron.
Roger. We had about 20 some points before you did that. And for your information, the reason the AGS is a little different there - The reason the AGS is a little different is because the K factor is a little bit wrong.
Has he already gone? Over. Okay. Okay. Has he already gone overhead, or do you want us to try and get in lock on again?
Houston, Columbia. You got NOUN 49. Five good marks.
Tranquility, affirmative. Try to lock on again, and you'll lose him at about 29 minutes and 35 seconds.
Okay. Do you have a real quick procedure how to do that?
Columbia, Houston. Say again about your NOUN 49.
I say I got five good marks. You got NOUN 49. When you get everything you need off the downlink, let me know.
Columbia, Houston. Stand by one.
Ron, did you say on the 526 alarm to proceed or do a VERB 32?
Roger. It's just that radar thinks the range is greater than 400 miles now.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Recommend you terminate P22. Over.
Roger. Will do.
And, Columbia, Houston. Same for you. You can terminate P22.
I have. I'm running fast.
Roger.
I'm staying in P22 here a second just to record the NOUN 89 and then over VERB 34.
Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy, and that's good.
Tranquility, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Request S BAND FUNCTION switch to RANGE. We're going to do some ranging on you. Also, I have an updated AGS K factor when you are ready to copy. Over.
Roger. Go ahead with the K factor.
Roger. 119 plus 59 plus 59.92. Over.
Roger. A little closer this time.
Yes. It sure is.
119 59 5992. Over.
Tranquility, Houston. Readback correct.
Columbia, Houston - -
Houston, Tranquility. I see what you mean now about the K factor.
Roger.
This is Columbia. Go ahead. And I'd like to know about this P52 coming up. Is that the one I just completed or do you want a pair of them back to back?
Columbia, Houston. You do not need to do another P52 unless you want to. Break. And also, Columbia, when you get a chance, request BATT C and the PYRO readouts. Over.
BATT C says 37 volts even. PYRO A, 37. PYRO B, 37.
Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy. Thank you.
BATT bus B is 37. BATT bus A is 36, or I'd think the gauge is stuck.
Roger. And you're looking good to us - to us, Columbia.
Yes sir. Keep it that way.
Columbia is coming up on a VERB 45 ENTER to reset the surface flag.
Columbia, Houston. Negative. Stand by on the VERB 45.
Roger that.
And a crew status report from Columbia. I figure I got about 5 hours' good sleep, although you guys probably know better than I do.
Columbia. Roger. We copy.
Columbia, Houston. We've got a couple more vectors to send up to you. They'll be coming up shortly and then you can do the VERB 45 after you get those in. Over.
Okay. That's fine. Just wanted to make sure that we're both in SYNC on the order.
Roger.
Columbia and Tranquility Base, this is Houston. In case you haven't noticed, the MSFN relay is not activated, so I can go ahead and relay anything if you want to talk directly.
Columbia. Roger.
Houston, Tranquility. Be advised we've got - -
...
Coming ... on schedule - - showing red right now. We just put a VERB 77 in. I believe that there's ... let me check here.
Tranquility Base, Houston. We've got a lot of static down here. Could you say again?
Roger. We have four out of eight circuit breaker talkbacks indicating red. We still have the circuit breakers out as of right now. I believe at this moment we have just entered VERB 77 on tape 3052 and are ready to proceed with the hot fire. Is it normal to have these four red flags? Over.
Tranquility Base, Houston. We think that's okay. Go ahead and reset them and press on with the hot fire. Over.
Roger. They are reset.
Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Request P00 and ACCEPT, and we'll send some state vectors up to you.
Here we going P00 and ACCEPT.
Houston, Tranquility. I used Capella in the last sighting, and it's a good ways near the edge. A good ways away from the center of detent 4. I'm wondering if it would pay any to use Alpheratz, star number 1. It might be a little closer. However, it would delay things a little, since I'd have to designate the radar out of the way. Over.
Tranquility. Roger. We copy. Stand by 1. And, break, break, Columbia. We're having a little trouble getting the stuff in there. Request high gain, pitch minus 20, yaw plus 150. Over.
And, Tranquility, Houston. We'd prefer to save the time; press on with Capella. Over.
Roger.
And, Tranquility, Houston. The RCS check looked mighty fine to us.
It looks good up here.
Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Columbia, Houston in the blind - high gain. Pitch minus 20, yaw plus 150.
Houston, Tranquility. Could you give me the fixed portion of the ascent PAD so I can load it in for a P57? Over.
Tranquility. Roger. Stand by one. We want to wait on that P57 until about TIG minus 50 minutes. Over.
Roger.
Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.
Columbia, Columbia, Houston. Over.
Houston, Tranquility. It turns out that detent 4 isn't usable anyway with the yaw that we have, because the Earth appears in both detent 2 and detent 3.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Roger.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Tranquility, Houston. I have your LM ascent and CSI data PAD's when you are ready to copy.
We're ready to copy.
Roger. LM ascent PAD: TIG 124 22 00 00 00 NOUN 76 55349 00322, plus 0017; DEDA 47, plus 37104, minus 70470, plus 58604, plus 56936. Your LM weight 10837. Your T14 126, plus 20, plus 12. Over.
What figure is the crossrange and NOUN 76?
Roger. Your crossrange for NOUN 76 - By the way, we may update this later, but now it is plus 0017. Over.
Roger. Readback follows. TIG 124 22 0000 55349 00322, plus 0017, plus 37104, minus 70470, plus 58604, plus 56936. LM weight 10837. T14, 126 20 12. Go.
Tranquility, Houston. Roger. Your readback correct. Now I have your CSI PAD.
Going to CSI PAD.
Roger. CSI PAD. TIG of CSI 125 19 3470; TIG of TPI 126 57 0000; NOUN 81, 0532 plus 0000; FDAI NA; DEDA 373 03196; DEDA 275 04170; NOUN 86 plus 0532, plus 0000, plus 0012. Tranquility readback.
CSI Apollo PAD follows. TIG 125 19 3470; TIG of TPI 126 57 0000; NOUN 81, 0532, plus all zeroes, 373 03196 275 04170; NOUN 86 plus 0532, plus 0000, plus 0012. Go.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Your readback is correct. And, Tranquility, no need for any GYRO compensation. It's GO.
Roger. Understand.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Columbia, Houston in the blind. Request high gain. Pitch minus 30, yaw plus 170. Over.
Houston, Columbia on the high gain. Over.
Roger, Columbia. We still need to finish your uplink there, and then I have your CSI and TPI times and also the lift off.
Go ahead. Ready to copy.
Roger. LM ascent lift off time: 124 22 0000. Your CSI TIG, say again CSI TIG: 125 19 3470. Your TIG of TPI: 126 57 0000. And the LM's NOUN 81 values for CSI: 0532 - that's 53.2 for DELTA VX, DELTA VY all zeros. Columbia, Houston. Over.
Roger. I readback lift off TIG 124 22 even, CSI 125 19 3470, TPI 126 57 even, the LM's NOUN 81 for CSI 53.2 DELTA VX. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Roger. Your readback correct.
Columbia, Houston. We're coming up with your second load now.
Roger that.
Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours, and you can do your VERB 45 ENTER now.
Roger. Go into BLOCK and VERB 45 ENTER.
Roger.
How's the Black Team today? All primed and raring to go?
You bet you there, Mike.
Good signal.
Columbia, Houston. About 3 minutes to LOS, and I have your consumables update.
Ready to copy.
Roger. At 123 plus 00, RCS total minus 7 percent, Alfa minus 12 percent, Bravo plus 4.5, Charlie minus 7, Delta minus 6.5. Your hydrogen total minus 1.4 pounds, oxygen - oxygen plus 1.7. Over.
Whoever figured those hydrogens and oxygens out a couple of days ago must have known what he was doing.
Okay. I think I read that oxygen - it's a plus 17 pounds.
Roger. Still close.
Roger.
Eagle and Columbia, this is the backup crew. Our congratulations for yesterday's performance, and our prayers are with you for the rendezvous. Over.
Thank you, Jim.
Thank you, Jim.
Glad to have all you big room full of people looking over our shoulder.
We had a lot of help down there, Jim.
And, Houston, Tranquility Base is going to give you a few comments with regard to the geology question of last night. We are landed in a relatively smooth crater field of elongate secondary - circular secondary craters, most of which have rims irrespective of their - raised rims irrespective of their size. That's not universally true. There are - There are a few of the smaller craters around which do not have a discernible rim. The ground mass throughout the area is a very fine sand to a silt. I'd say the thing that would be most like it on Earth is powdered graphite. Immersed in this ground mass are a wide variety of rock shapes, sizes, textures, rounded and angular, many with varying consistencies. As I said, I've seen plain - what looked to be plain basalt and vesicular basalt. Others with no crystals, some with small white phenocrysts, maybe one to less than 5 percent. And the bould - we are in a boulder field where the boulders range generally up to 2 feet with a few larger than that. Now, some of the boulders are lying on top of the surface, some are partially exposed, and some are just barely exposed. And in our traverse around on the surface and particularly working with the scoop, we've run into boulders below the surface - it was probably buried under several inches of the ground mass.
Tranquility, Houston. Roger. Very fine description.
I suspect this boulder field may have some of its origin with this large sharp edged rocky rim crater that we passed over at final descent. Now yesterday I said that was about the size of a football field, and I have to admit it was a little - little hard to measure coming in. But I thought that it might just fit in the Astrodome as we came by it. And the rocks in the vicinity of the - of this rocky rim crater are much larger than these in this area. Some are 10 feet or so and perhaps bigger, and they are very thickly populated out to about one crater diameter beyond the crater rim. Beyond that, there is some diminishing, and even out in this area the blocks seem to run out in rows with irregular patterns, and then there are paths between them where there are considerably less surface evidence of hard rocks. Over.
Tranquility Base, Houston. We copy. Thank you very much.
And, Tranquility Base, we're through with the ranging. You can take your S band function switch to OFF RESET.
Roger.
And, Tranquility, I have a LM consumables update for you.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay. At 123 plus 00, RCS Alfa 78 - 78 percent PQMD, Bravo is 76 percent PQMD, descent O<sub>2</sub> is 62 percent - 62 percent. Descent ampere hours are 590, 590 remaining, ascent ampere hours are 574, 574 remaining. Over.
Roger. Copy. Sounds very good. Thank you.
Roger.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. For your P57 ..., we did a little looking around, and it looks like Sirius and Rigel out at detent 6 would be real good on that. The Sun angle on Sirius is about 43 degrees, and on Rigel, it's about 55 degrees. Over.
Roger, Houston. The only trouble is that the Sun is in number 5, the closed one. And it appears to also be close enough to detent 6 to shine on the far side of the cone. And it completely obscures detent 6. I'm - unable to use that at all.
Okay. We understand it now, and thank you.
Tranquility, Houston. For your information, the circuitry looks real fine on that ascent engine arm circuit breaker.
Roger. I don't think I could get it out now if I wanted to.
Roger. We copy.
And it looks like in detent 6 I can pick up Venus right at the fringe, but I can't get anything else.
Roger.
And by the way, Houston, our EVA antenna did retract.
Roger. Mighty fine. Thank you.
Tranquility, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. It looks like you're going to have to reposition the radar here. We suggest you may want to start your TIG minus 45 minute - that point in the checklist at about TIG minus 50. Over.
Roger. Why do you think I need to move the radar?
Well, we thought that you probably wouldn't be able to get the star there.
On the rear detent, the radar can be pointing plus X, and I'm - I'll be using right rear. That's okay.
Roger. That's fine then.
Tranquility Base, Houston. I have one more late checklist change there on the rendezvous radar position for lift off. Over. From page Surface 57.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. On Surface 57 there on your VERB 21 NOUN 73 trunnion, leave it 180; the shaft we'd like 335. Over.
Roger. Understand. Shaft 335.
Roger. And if the steerable doesn't quite hack it on lift off, looks like the forward OMNI is good for about 30 to 60 seconds after lift off. And then the aft OMNI antenna is good for the rest of the ascent. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, we've got two angles here at 3 minutes in ascent. Would you confirm those? Pitch 134 and yaw minus 32. Over.
Tranquility Base. Roger. We verify; those are correct.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Eagle's looking real fine to us down here. We have a fairly high confidence that we know the position of the LM. However, it is possible that we may have a planes change, but the - In the worst case, it would be up to 30 feet per second. And, of course, we don't expect that at all.
Okay.
Houston, Tranquility Base. Since we've still got plenty of time I think I'll go ahead and recycle on this 604.
Tranquility. Roger. That's okay with us, and we assume that the primary canister is still aboard. Is this correct?
We have one primary canister on board and one secondary. The other primary is - out in front of the Z - plus - Z pad. Over.
Roger. We copy. Thank you.
Ready for the blue bag - -
The PGNS looks consistent today.
Hey, that's affirmative, by gosh. Looking great.
Houston, did you copy NOUN 05, and are you looking at 93? Over.
Tranquility Base. It's beautiful.
Okay. We'll proceed.
Roger.
I know where the star is; I'm not sure the PGNS knows where gravity is.
Okay.
Houston, these are your angles, not ours.
Roger, Tranquility.
Stand by for some change or modification in the angles.
Tranquility Base, Houston. Recommend 334, and that should just keep it out of the limit.
Okay.
Houston, Columbia on OMNI D Delta. Over.
Columbia, Houston. Roger. Loud and clear. And if you would like to take it down, we have the latest position of Tranquility Base. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. It's just west - at west crater, Juliett 0.5, 7.7. Over.
Understand that it is just west of the crater Juliett 0.5 and 7.7. Is that correct?
Columbia, Houston. That is correct.
Okay. Thank you, Ron.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Because of the lower load with the rendezvous radar off, we'd like to have battery 5 and 6 on the line now, 1 and 3 off. Over.
In work.
Roger. Thank you.
Columbia, Houston. You're still looking mighty fine to us.
...
Columbia is holding inertially at lift off attitude, my DAP is configured as per my procedures at a time of 124 02.
Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy you.
I'm using B and D roll.
Tranquility, Houston. Say again.
Houston, we were not calling.
Roger. Columbia, was that Bravo and Delta roll? Over.
Columbia, affirmative.
Roger.
Columbia and Tranquility, I'll give you a Mark at 20 minutes to go, and that's in about 20 seconds.
Stand by.
MARK.
20 minutes.
Columbia. Roger.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Just a reminder here, we want to make sure you leave the rendezvous radar circuit breakers pulled. However, we want the rendezvous radar mode switch in LGC, Just as it is on Surface 59.
Okay.
Tranquility Base, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Our guidance recommendation is PGNS, and you're cleared for takeoff.
Roger. Understand. We're number 1 on the runway.
Roger.
Houston, Tranquility. We're not sure that we got number 2 tank to fire. It's still showing a high pressure.
Roger. We confirm that. Try it again.
Okay. We'll go to number 2 this time.
Roger. We concur.
Roger. No problem.
Houston, looks like there's very little difference between the two.
Roger.
We've got number 2 reading 3050 and number 1 is reading - 3000 and it drops down to 2990. So I'm not sure that it's really indicative that it didn't go. Over.
Roger. We copy and we agree.
Okay. I assume we're - we're GO for lift off, and we'll proceed with the ascent feed.
Roger. That's correct, and we'll go ahead and watch tank 2. If it doesn't - tank 2 doesn't decrease, we'll tell you to close the ascent feeds and open the shutoffs. Over.
Okay. Ascent feeds are open and shutoffs are closed.
Roger.
And I've got the cross feed on.
Tranquility Base, little less than 10 minutes here. Everything looks good and we assume the steerable's in track mode AUTO.
Roger. It is in track mode AUTO.
Roger.
And both ED batteries are GO.
Tranquility, Houston. Roger.
Neil, I'm reading you on VHF. You sound good.
Yes sir. Couldn't be better. It's just purring along.

Looking good here. It's a pretty spectacular ride.
... of to the right.
Eagle, Houston. You're still looking mighty fine.
Roger. Good agreement in DELTA V to go in both AGS and PGNS.
Roger.
Got 800 to go.
700 to go. Okay, I'm going to open up the main shutoffs.
Ascent feed closed; pressure's holding good, cross feed ON, 350 to go.
Stand by on the engine arm. 90, okay, OFF, 50.
SHUTDOWN.
We got 53373, 32.8 feet per second, 60 666.
Eagle. Roger. We copy. It's great. Go.
And we got - got our residuals.

Eagle, Houston. Trim residuals.
...
We're working on it.
Eagle, Houston. Trim looks good.
That's good.
Eagle, Columbia. ... got a solid lock on in VHF ranging and ... 480 feet per second.
Okay. That sounds a little - little on the high side.
Yes. I'll update it here shortly.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We show 47.3 by 9.5.
Roger. 47.2 by 9.5.
AGS has 9.5, 46.6.
Eagle, Houston. Copy.
Eagle, Houston. Request abort stage, reset, ... PROP reset, and mode control to ATT HOLD when you get a chance to.
Roger.
Eagle, Houston. You can go ahead and proceed with P52 as per nominal.
Roger, Houston. The Eagle is back in orbit, having left Tranquility Base and leaving behind a - a replica from our Apollo 11 patch and the olive branch.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy. The whole world is proud of you.
We had a lot of help down there.
Eagle, Columbia. I've got 470 now for R dot, and I just broke lock. Could you hold silent for a few seconds here while I reacquire.
Columbia's reacquired you.
Columbia, Houston. Request P00 in ACCEPT, and we'll give you a good GO LM vector. Over.
Roger. Houston. Going to ACCEPT.
Eagle, Houston. You can go ahead and turn your updata link switch off.
Roger. It's off.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. The computer is yours. Press on.
Okay.
Houston, the AGS has a DELTA H of 15.5.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. 15.5.
And a maneuver of - and a maneuver of 51.3.
Roger. We copy. And, Eagle, aft OMNI. Over.
Roger. Aft OMNI.

Eagle, Houston in the blind. Try low bit rate. Over.
Roger. Low bit rate. I've got a 3.8 signal strength. Over.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy your signal strength 3.8.
37, I believe.
Eagle, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. We saw a very slight jump in cabin and suit pressure there. Could you verify cabin REPRESS valve is closed?
Okay. It's closed.
Roger. And we've got about 1 minute to before where you ought to be radar tracking, and we've lost data with you.
Okay. ...
Okay. Get a pass.
Got it? ...
Eagle, Columbia. You can turn your ... light off.
Okay. You got it?
Yes.
All ready to mark, X and Y. Okay. Marked X now.

I can't tell.
Okay. Mark Y.
That enough? Beautiful! All zeros. Okay. Let's torque them. I'll write them down. Minus 06, plus 64, plus ... 7. Torque ... Radar circuit breakers in?
***
Yes. We're pointed down pretty much. We're going to be up - -
Okay. ... circuit - -
Roger.
- - breaker in? Both circuit breakers in?
*** - -
...
- - ***
Okay. AUTO maneuver.
***
Columbia, Houston. Did you call?
That's affirmative. I called you before about the VHF ranging. It's not working. ***
Houston, Eagle. Did you copy our star angle difference and torquing angles.
Eagle, Houston. We didn't have them on the downlink but we copied them on the VOX.
Okay. It was zero for star angle difference, minus 06, plus 64, and plus 1.37. Over.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We have that.
That's it. Got a good lockon, Houston.
... take that.
How about that?
Your really think its apogee is 125 21, huh? 25 ... That circuit breaker is in.
Engine arm circuit breaker.
Okay. There's a mark. Buy that?
Eagle, Houston. If you have time, pitch 162, yaw minus 16.
You load the REFSMMAT? Okay.
Eagle, Columbia. Your Y dot is minus 1.0. Over.
Mike, you're ...
Eagle, do you read Columbia? Over.
Eagle, this is Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Roger, Columbia. Loud and clear now. This is Houston.
Roger. Would you tell Eagle his Y dot is minus 1.0. Over.
Roger. Eagle, Columbia says your Y dot is minus 1.0. Over.
Roger, Houston. We got that. Thank you.
Roger. And you can go high bit rate now. Eagle can.
Eagle, Columbia. How do you read?
AGS agrees very closely, and pointing ...
Houston, Columbia is unable to read Eagle on either antenna or on VHF duplex Bravo. You got any suggestions?
Roger. Columbia, we understand. You are unable to read Eagle. Stand by.
Houston, tell Columbia that we read him about strength 2.
Okay. Wide deadband on.
Houston, Columbia. Also my VHF ranging is not working now, and I'd like to know whether you'd like me to continue making sextant marks or do nothing. I'm supposed to be doing VHF marks only, and it's for the next 6 or 7 minutes.
Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy. And, Eagle, looks like the best antenna would be forward for the LM. And, break. Eagle, we missed your loading of the TPI TIG and P32. Could you confirm you've done that?
Columbia, Houston. Recommend you take sextant marks and do not reinitialize. Over.
Roger, Houston. Columbia's got the VHF ranging back now. I'll stick with the nominal. Thank you.
Roger. Mighty fine.
Columbia reading you loud and clear now, Eagle.
Columbia, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Mike, you can go ahead and get as many VHF and sextant marks as you can here in this period of time.
Roger. I've just got time for maybe two sextant marks, then get on with the final count.
Eagle and Columbia, about 1 minute till LOS there on Columbia. It looks like we have about 51.5 for CSI, and we tend to confirm your Y dot. And, break. For Eagle, verify VHF Bravo transmitter is off.
Roger. VHF Bravo is off.
Eagle, Houston. Recommend aft OMNI and are you GO for CSI, so we can let Columbia know. Over.
Roger. We're GO for CSI.
Columbia, Houston. Did you copy? Eagle is GO for CSI.
No, I did not copy. I'm reading them only intermittently, but thank you.
Roger.
Eagle, Houston. We'll see you coming around the other side. Your AOS time - is 1 minute ahead of the flight plan.
Okay. Thank you.
...
Columbia, Houston. Heard you talked to Eagle? I assume you have COMM with Eagle now?
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia in OMNI D Delta. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Columbia, Houston. You're very weak. Say again.
Roger. Houston, Columbia. CSI nominal; no plane change. Everything's going beautifully, and the LM seems to be ...your laser...
Columbia, Houston. You're about one by, I could just barely make you out. I can't understand.
Houston, Columbia. How now?
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, Columbia. Over.
Houston, this is Eagle. Over.
Hey, Eagle. Houston loud and clear. Columbia was very weak. We were unable to read him.
Roger. We saw you come up over the horizon and it looks like you had a laser operating. Could you confirm that?
Eagle, Houston. Stand by. We'll check it. And, Eagle, Houston. Can you give us a burn report?
Roger. Stand by.
Okay. The CSI burn was on scheduled time of 125 19 3470, 51.5 feet per second was our solution. After chasing residuals a little bit, we ended up with a minus 0.2, plus 0.7, and minus 0.1. And in the AGS, at that time, we had plus 0.4, plus 0.9, and plus 0.3.
Eagle - Eagle, Houston. We copy. Any plane change? Over.
No. There was no plane change on CSI, and CSM had a 2.3 foot per second burn. We had a 2.9, and we elected to postpone that. Over.
Roger. We copy, Eagle. Thank you.
Houston, how do you read Columbia now?
Eagle, how about asking them for some high gain angles for me, will you, please?
Roger, Houston, do you have some high gain angles for Columbia? Over.
Roger, Eagle. And, Columbia, stand by. We'll have them for you shortly.
Eagle, Houston. Could you verify you switched lithium hydroxide canisters? Over.
That's affirmative. We started getting an erratic indication on primary, so we switched to secondary, and it was again erratic and I thought it might have been a sensor. But it's settled down now, and we're on the secondary. Over.
Roger. We copy. Mighty fine.
Columbia and Eagle. Request OMNI Delta for Columbia.
Roger, Houston. I've been in Delta the whole time but it doesn't ...
Houston. Columbia's been on Delta, but he hasn't had much luck with you.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy.
Eagle, are you ready to copy your Y dot?
Go ahead.
***
Eagle, Houston. At your convenience, we'd like to go ahead and try your lithium hydroxides on the primary and let us take a look at it down here.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. ***
Houston, Eagle. Columbia's been reading you loud and clear on his OMNI's, but he hasn't had any luck in transmitting to you.
Roger, Eagle. Mighty fine. We don't hear Columbia though.
Okay.
We're burning ours, Mike. Minus 1.8.
Eagle, Houston. ...
Columbia, Houston. ...
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Columbia, Houston. You can go ahead and go to REACQ in the high gain. We should get you then.
Do you have some angles for him, Houston?
Roger. Pitch minus 30, yaw 180, for Columbia.
Okay. And what was your CSI - CDH solution, Mike?
***
Roger. Copy. Thank you.
And, Houston, Eagle. Got an ECS light - a CO<sub>2</sub> light. Partial pressure's reading about one half millimeter.
Eagle and Columbia, Houston. Roger. We copy.
Houston, how do you read Columbia?
Columbia, Houston. Go.
Eagle, Houston. We're sure that's a sensor problem. You can leave it on PRIMARY.
Okay.
Roger. We pulled the circuit breakers.
Roger, Eagle.
And our water separator apparently isn't working too well. We're getting a lot of water through the suit loop, and we've changed water separators, but it doesn't seem to have improved the situation any.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy.
Eagle, Columbia. Standing by to back you up on the burn. Just let me know how it's going.
Okay.
Okay. You want to know what our NOUN 81 is?
Ready to copy.
Okay. I think you already got the burn time; minus 8.1, minus 1.8, minus 18.2.
Okay, that's pretty close agreement. And, for burn time, I still have 126 17 46.
Roger.
Eagle, Houston. For warm feeling, we are agreeing with your CDH.
Congratulations.
Unfortunately, the chart doesn't agree with it, because the range rate at 36 minutes was off the chart.
Thirty seconds.
We're ready to burn.
Okay.
Yes. I'm ready. ...
Burn complete?
Burn complete.
Thank you.
Eagle, Houston. When you get a chance, are your LCG's hooked up? And if so, what does the LCG accumulator show?
Eagle, Columbia. Passing over the Landing Site. It sure is great to look down there and not see you.
...
Eagle, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Did you copy on the LCG, there, and the reading on the water accumulator?
Yes. Roger. I did. I'm getting ...
Houston, the water accumulator is right on the line between the red and the green. Over.
Eagle, Houston. Roger. We copy.
Eagle, Houston.
Houston, Eagle.
Roger. On the water problem, we can't add anything more to it, except the fact that it looks like the water accumulators are up to speed to us down here.
Okay. It's not going to be too much trouble.
Roger. Fine.
It's just in one suit, too, for some reason.
Columbia, Houston. Our COMM problem was traced to a ground station here.
Okay. Glad to hear it.
Roger. You're mighty fine now.
Range rate at 30.
I have a TPI TIG when you guys want to compare them.
Stand by.
... 19.8.
Go ahead, Mike. What have you got?
127 02 3450.
You're about 32 seconds *** than we are.
Okay, fine.
***
*** and I'll do it.
*** want to get another *** data update ***
Mark it *** range.
Mark.
Range rate at 40.
Buzz, I would like to confirm that your TPI TIG is 127 02 02. Over.
We haven't settled on a final one yet. The last one was - stand by.
Roger. Understand.
Just as soon as you know what TPI TIG is going to be, I would appreciate a call.
Okay.
Last I got was 32 seconds earlier than mine which would make it 127 02 02.
Thank you. Are you going to be revising that one?
I think probably so. How late - How late can you take a revision?
Well, to stay on my time line, I should have it in the next couple of minutes.
Okay. Latest estimate, 127 03 39.
Thank you kindly,
Eagle, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. In the event of the possibility that we may have had some water channeling in those hydroxide canisters, we recommend you stay in the cabin mode from now on. Over.
Roger.
Eagle, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I'd better clarify that cabin mode a little bit there. What we mean is you go ahead and stay in the cabin mode. Helmets and gloves on are your option. And we really have no concern with the CO<sub>2</sub>. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Mike, you already loaded that time? We've got a final one here.
I've already loaded it. I don't think it'll make much difference.
Roger. Only 9 seconds difference.
MARKS next.
Columbia, Houston.
Columbia. Go ahead.
Roger, Mike. You can go ahead and arm your logic anytime you want to, and we'll give you a GO so that you can get your PYRO ARM at your convenience.
That's a good idea, babe. You standing by to watch the logic?
Affirmative. Give us a Mark.
MARK LOGIC 1.
MARK LOGIC 2.
Columbia, Houston. We need the SEQ ARM circuit breakers closed.
Okay. Going in SEQ ARM BATT A, and BATT B.
Columbia, Houston. Logic looks good. You can arm your PYRO's at your convenience.
Thank you.
Eagle, Columbia's starting to maneuver to TPI attitude.
Okay.
Eagle and Columbia, Houston. All your solutions look good to us. Out.
And, Mike, if you want our target DELTA V, I'll give it to you.
Ready to copy.
127 03 3082, plus 22.7, plus 1.7, minus 10.6. Over.
127 03 3082, plus 22.7, plus 1.7, minus 10.6. Thank you.
I'm showing a good bit of out of plane velocity on my cross pointers, Mike.
Roger. I have no indication of it.
Coming up on 1 minute to TIG, Neil. How's it looking?
Pretty good.
Good.
That out of plane was in the AGS, not in the radar.
Roger that.
We're burning.
That a boy!
Burn complete?
Read burn complete.
Roger. Thank you.
Eagle, Houston. Aft OMNI, low bit rate, an we'll see you at 127 plus 51.
Okay. You've got me.
Eagle and Columbia, Houston. Standing by.
Roger. We're stationkeeping.
Roger.
Okay, Mike. I'll get - try to get in position here, then you got it.
How does the roll attitude look?
I'll stop. Matter of fact, I can stop right here if you like that.
Eagle, Houston. Middle gimbal. And you might pass to Columbia, we don't have him yet.
That's right.
I'm not going to do a thing, Mike. I'm just letting her hold in ATTITUDE HOLD.
Okay.
You ...
Okay.
Okay. We're all yours. Roger.
Okay. Okay, I have thrusters B3 and C4 safetied.
Okay.
I'm pumping up cabin pressure.
That was a funny one. You know, I didn't feel it shock, and I thought things were pretty steady. I went to RETRACT there, and that's when all hell broke loose. Were you guys - did it appear to you to be - that you were jerking around quite a bit during the retrack cycle?
Yes. It seemed to happen at the time I put the plus X thrust to it, and apparently it wasn't centered, because somehow or other I accidentally got off in attitude and then the attitude hold system started firing.
Yes. I was sure busy there for a couple of seconds.
Are you hearing me all right? I got a horrible squeal.
Yes. I agree with that, but we hear you okay. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Go.
Roger. I'm supposed to adjust the oxygen flow in this thing to six tenths of a pound per hour, but being as how this transducer is not working right, could you give me an updated number?
Affirmative. You want to go ahead and adjust your O<sub>2</sub> flow until it just goes off the peg, and then crank the direct O<sub>2</sub> valve back down about 5 degrees. Over.
Boy, you were really waiting for that one, weren't you? Okay, Ron. Thank you.
Houston, I did that, and I believe we are flowing oxygen, but the gage is just pegged FULL SCALE LOW.
Roger. That's fine. That's what we expect.
Okay.
Okay. I'm going to go ahead with the tunnel leak check.
Columbia, Houston. I have a new LM weight for you whenever you're ready to copy.
Not right now, Ron. Remind me of it later, would you please?
Roger. We'll stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. I let P47 run longer than I should. I may have deteriorated our state vector slightly.
Roger, Apollo 11. That's okay. We'll see later.
Houston, Apollo 11. Go ahead with your DAP up, please.
Roger. Your LM weight, 5785. For an R1 we'd like to have 61102, R2 01111. Use BD roll. Over.
Roger. I'm configured now at ... for BD roll, and I have thrusters C4 and B3 turned off, and I copy register 1 61102 01111 and LM weight 5785. Thank you.
Roger, Columbia.
Houston, Columbia has completed the leak check, and proceeding with opening the hatch dump valve.
Roger, Columbia. Understand you're doing the leak check. I missed anything after that.
I say the leak check is complete, and I'm proceeding with opening the hatch dump valve.
Eagle - Columbia, Roger.
Eagle, Columbia.
Go ahead.
My hatch is removed. You can open yours, and I'll start passing stuff up to you.
Okay.
No. Stand by one, first.
Okay.
Mike, you ...
Yes, everything is going fine. Be with you in just a second.
Eagle, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston, Eagle here.
Roger. Any time prior to jettison there, we'd like an AGS to PGNS align: 400 plus 30 000. Over.
Okay. Any particular attitude you would like the PGNS in when we do that?
No. We're not getting any. Could you give us some course align gimbal angles to move the PGNS to, and then we will align the AGS to the PGNS. Over.
Roger. Eagle. We concur. Stand by on the gimbal angles. And also, Eagle, while we've got the command module direct O<sub>2</sub> on there, there's a possibility that your cabin relief might relieve if we get up around cabin pressure of about 5.4 or 5.5.
Roger.
Eagle, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. All we are trying to do is get PGNS and AGS aligned together. Doesn't make any difference on the gimbal angle.
...
Okay. We are pretty close to 000. Is that all right?
Eagle, that's beautiful.
Now, you might want to take into account what will happen when the CSM maneuvers to jettison attitude.
Eagle, Houston. We don't care what - All we are trying to do is get a drift rate and see how long it takes them to drift apart on the thing after you jettison.
Okay. Will we be jettisoning at about this attitude? That's okay. I'll align the AGS with the PGNS. You can tell me a little later if you need some help.
Eagle, Houston. That's fine.
Houston, Columbia. You want me to roll over and get high gain or anything like that?
Columbia, Houston. I can give you some REACQ angles for the high gain on the LM jettison attitude. Then you can go there whenever you want to. The angles are pitch minus 50, and yaw zero.
Okay.
Houston, Columbia. Say again the jettison roll, pitch, and yaw, please.
Columbia, Houston. Roll zero, pitch 025, and yaw zero. Over.
Roger. Understand roll zero, pitch 025, yaw zero.
That's affirmative.
... in progress. We've moving. Houston.
Houston, Eagle. Over.
Eagle, Houston. Go.
Roger. It doesn't appear as though the red hose is going to be much of a competitor to the leading vacuum cleaner brands. Over.
There's a little noise there, Buzz. Say again.
Eagle, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Just a reminder to be sure to zero the AGS errors before you enable the AGS attitude hold there after you get in burn attitude.
Roger. You mean SEP attitude?
Houston, how do you read Columbia on high gain now?
Hey, Columbia. Houston. Mighty fine; loud and clear.
Same here, Ron. Thanks.
And Eagle, Houston. Your steerable antenna angles for jettison attitude are - Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Pitch 165, yaw 68. Over.
Roger. Pitch 165, yaw 68.
Eagle, Houston. Correct.
Columbia, Houston.
Columbia. Go ahead.
Roger, Mike. You want to tweak the O<sub>2</sub> flow up just a bit there?
Okay. Coming up. Houston, do you have any preferences as to what you want us to do with the probe? Over.
Columbia, Houston. Stand by one.
Okay. Eagle says they've got a place for it inside there, so no problem.
Roger. That's all we were assuming.
Eagle, Houston.
Eagle. Go ahead.
Roger. Neil, it looks like your steerable's good. You can put your track mode to slew and high bit rate, please. Over.
Okay. Track mode to slew and high bit rate.
Okay. Stand by just one, please.
Okay. Shoot them on down.
Eagle, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Neil, just a reminder again, the ACA out of detent to zero; the AGS out of there just in case you go to ATTITUDE HOLD shortly.
Okay.
You say you wanted the probe now?
Eagle, Houston.
Houston, Eagle. Go ahead.
Roger. That ACA out of detent didn't quite do it because the mode control switches were off. Request guidance control to PGNS and then back to AGS, and that will zero the AGS, there. Over.
Say again, please.
Roger. Request guidance control switch to PGNS and then back to AGS. Over.
Okay. We still have both mode control switches off. Over.
That's okay. That's good.
And I thought I'd just take about 5 seconds here and see if I could get 000 gone, since we're fairly close to gimbal lock right now.
Eagle, Houston. That's fine.
Columbia and Eagle, Houston. About 5 minutes to LOS. Your LM jet time will be 131 plus 52, and I have the rest of the maneuver PAD if you want it now, or I can give it to you on the next time around.
Stand by one.
Could you read it around the next time around, please?
Sure, Mike. That's fine. We'll get it to you then.
Apollo 11, Houston. About a minute and a half to LOS. You're looking great. It's been a mighty fine day.
Boy, you're not kidding.
Hello, Eagle. Houston. Do you read? Over.
Houston, this is Columbia. Reading you loud and clear. We're all three back inside; the hatch is installed. We're running a pressure check leak check. Everything's going well.
Roger, Eagle. Correction - Roger, Columbia. We copy. You guys are speedy; you beat us to the punch. We had a couple of things for you.
What are they?
Oh, it was just - We wanted you to close the CO<sub>2</sub> sensor breaker and give us an RCS onboard readout out of Eagle, but that's all. Columbia, Houston. We've got a state vector for you if you'll give us P00 in ACCEPT. Over.
Buzz says the CO<sub>2</sub> sensor circuit breaker is IN
Roger. Thank you very much.
The RCS quantity was approximately 60 at A and 45 percent at B.
Roger.
And we're going P00 in ACCEPT.
Roger. Thank you.
Columbia, Houston. Your friendly White Team's going to be on till we get you on the way home, and we'd like to congratulate everybody on a successful rendezvous and a beautiful EVA. It was a great show for everybody. Over.
Thank you, sir. I'll tell Neil and Buzz.
Houston, the hatch passes its integrity check. I'm going to go to LM tunnel VENT now, and leave it there.
Roger, Columbia. We copy. That's good, and we'd like a readout on the TEP of about the time you - that Eagle selected the secondary loop. Over.
Stand by.
Hello, Columbia. Houston. We got the load in. You can do the VERB 66 and the computer is yours. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. I'd say that the secondary loop was actuated about 15 to 20 minutes ago. Over.
Roger. Copy. Columbia. Thank you very much.
Columbia, Houston. It looks like you guys are so speedy on us that we're thinking about moving up jettison time to about a GET of 130 plus 30, if that's okay with you all. Over.
That's fine. I've still got to get a P30 PAD from you.
Roger. We want to talk to you about that. Mike, we can - for your druthers, we can do it either way. We can either let you do it in the jettison in P30 - correction P47, or we can send you a P30 target load up and then you - let you call P41, whichever you want to do. Over.
Yes, I see. Ron was going to give me a P30 PAD and the flight plan says P47. Out of the two, I prefer to go to P30, P41 route.
Roger. Beautiful. We've got the load. If you'll give us P00 and ACCEPT, we'll send you a load up. Stand by.
Columbia, Houston. We'd like you to terminate direct O<sub>2</sub> flow, and stand by on your P00 and ACCEPT. We'll have to generate a new load due to the moveup on time. Over.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Mike. It looks like if we move up this jettison time and give you a new load, it would require a new attitude, and we can't do that due to the LM already closed out, and it would fight us all the way around and we'd lose COMM with it. We're thinking separating in P47 in about 10 minutes. We're looking at trajectories and we'll be right with you momentarily. Over.
Okay. It's no big thing with me either way.
Roger.
Hello, Columbia. Houston. We'd like you to start down your jettison checklist. We recommend picking up page F11 - 12 and we'd like to jettison at 10 minutes. That'll be 130 14 15. Over.
Right.
Columbia, Houston. If that's not satisfactory, let us know. Over.
Right.
Houston, Columbia. How about a GO for logic BUS ARM.
Stand by.
Columbia, Houston. You've got a GO.
Thank you.
Columbia, Houston. You can undock at your convenience, correction, jettison at your convenience. We would like you to jettison Eagle and stationkeep - in P47 and stationkeep, and we'll have another attitude and a maneuver for you so we'll be okay for TEI. Over.
Roger that.
And I'm standing by to go to P47 just as soon as you give me a go for PYRO ARM.
Roger. I thought we gave you that. Mike, you're GO for PYRO ARM and you're GO for jettison.
Okay.
Okay. Let her go in 10 seconds.
Copy. Out.
NOUN 83 reading minus four balls, minus three balls, 3 or - correction - minus - both register 1 and register 2 are reading minus four balls 3, register 3 is zeros, the EMS remained on 100.00. A fairly loud noise, and it appears to be departing - oh, I would guess several feet per second.
Roger, can you kind of stationkeep with it, Mike? Just stand by now.
Will do.
Columbia, Houston. Don't try to chase it, just hold what you've got.
Charlie, did it hold cabin pressure this time?
Say again, Buzz. Over.
Okay. I thrusted back - I thrusted back toward it a little bit, Charlie, and I'm now reading NOUN 83, plus four balls 4, minus four balls 8, and you want me to kill average D. Right?
Stand by. That's affirmative. You can exit P47.
There she goes. It was a good one.
Roger dodger. We got Eagle looking good. It's holding cabin pressure and it picked up about 2 feet per second from that jettison.
I believe that. I can see some cracks on the outer coating around the tunnel. In the thermal protective covering, I don't think it has anything to do with the structure.
Roger.
Hello, Columbia, Houston. We'll have an attitude and a little blip burn for you in about 130 30, so we can separate from Eagle. Over.
That's fine.
Columbia, Houston. Would you start a maneuver to a pitch of 230 for this little tweak burn? Over.
Roger. Pitch 230.
Roger, Mike. And verify track mode in AUTO for the high gain.
We're in REACQ. Is that all right?
Say again. We need AUTO.
Say again. We're in REACQ - AUTO REACQ.
Roger. We need AUTO, please, sir.
Okay. You got it.
Roll zero, pitch 320, yaw zero?
Right now that's what we're looking at. Stand by. We might have you roll so we can keep the high gain. Stand by.
Roger.
Columbia, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Mike - -
Apollo 11, these days.
Oh, Roger, Apollo 11. We got you going to a posigrade attitude and we want you - this burn will be using minus X thrusters at about 2 or 3 feet per second, and we got a load for you. We'll send it up momentarily. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us P00 and ACCEPT? We have a load for you. Over.
You got it.
Roger, Mike. And our pitch attitude's a little wrong here. If you're ready to copy, I'll give you the SEP PAD. Over.
Go ahead. Ready to copy.
Roger. Starting with NOUN 33: 130 30 0000, plus 00020, plus all zeros, plus all zeros. Roll all zeros, pitch 230, yaw zero. NOUN 44 is NA. DELTA-VP 00020, burn time 007, DELTA-VC 00020. We have - The rest of the PAD is NA.
Roger. GET 130 hours 30 minutes, DELTA-VX 2.0, roll zero, pitch 230, yaw zero, DELTA-VC, 2.0.
That's affirmative, Apollo 11. And, Mike, it's similar to the SEP burn prior to flight after the undocking here. And the P41 you should see on register 1 - 2, and then you burn minus X until you read 4. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Computer's yours. Over.
Roger, Charlie. We switched our OMNI D - Delta, and I lost that last transmission. Would you say again, please? The thing I'm wondering about specifically is that earlier you said it would be minus X thrusters and the PAD indicates plus X. Do you want me to null that to zero or do you want to add 2 and leave it as a 4?
Roger, Apollo 11. The way we gave it to you in the attitude we're in, it'll be just like the SEP burn that you had yesterday. You'll see - NOUN 85 will give you a plus 2 and then you just burn minus X until you read 4. Over.
Understand.
Apollo 11, Houston. We see you in P41 now. It might take you a couple of minutes to integrate these vectors that we gave you and if you don't make TIG, it's pretty insensitive. You can just let P41 bring you up to TIG, and when you get to zero, you can burn on that. Over.
Okay.
Okay. Burn complete. Residuals: plus three balls 40, plus four balls 7, plus four balls 2, DELTA-V counter 102.1. Over.
Copy, Apollo 11. Looks good to us. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. How about coming up with a good communications attitude for us to go to between now and the time we maneuver at TEI attitude.
Roger, sir. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of things for you. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. Mike, you can maneuver to your preliminary TEI attitude as shown on page 398 of the flight plan, and the high gain angles are good as shown in the flight plan, and we'd like you to dump the waste water at 131 05 down to 10 percent. Over.
Okay. Understand. I'm going to go to roll 1.1, pitch zero - or 52.6, and yaw 13.8, and you want a waste water dump 10 percent starting at 131 05.
That's affirmative. Right out the LOS.
Maneuver is in progress, Houston.
Copy, 11. Out.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Apollo 11 under high gain. How do you read?
Five by, 11. How me? Over.
You're loud and clear, Charlie. What - What numbers are you looking at for TEI TIG preliminary; 135 hours 23 minutes, something like that?
That's affirmative, Mike. We're looking at about nominal time. We've considered kicking it up a REV, but we don't think this REV track is going to be any good since we had the RCS burn and we need some more tracking to get you a good TEI. Over.
That's what we're looking for.
Roger.
11, Houston. Looks like it's going to be pretty relaxed time here for the next couple of hours. We'll have you a PAD, of course, the next REV or so, and we'll keep you posted on TEI. Looks like nominal time. Over.
Thank you, Charlie.
And your little maneuver back here a moment ago will put you about 20 miles ahead of the LM at TEI.
Okay.
Imagine that place has cleared out a little bit after that rendezvous. You can find a place to sit down almost, huh?
Roger. Our MOCR's about empty right now. We're taking it a little easy. How does it feel up there to have some company?
Damn good, I'll tell you.
I'll bet. I bet, you'd almost be talking to yourself up there after 10 REVS or so.
No, no. It's a happy home here. It'd be nice to have company. As a matter of fact, it'd be nice to have a couple of hundred million Americans up here.
Roger. Well, they were with you in spirit.
Let them see what they're getting for their money.
Roger. Well, they were with you in spirit anyway, at least that many. We heard on the news today, 11, that last night - yesterday after you made your landing, New York Times came out with a - headlines, the largest headlines they've ever used in the history of the newspaper.
Save us a copy.
I'm glad to hear it was fit to print.
It was great.
That's why we didn't read you up any newscast. There really wasn't anything to talk about.
Hello, there, Boss.
Apollo 11, Houston. We've got 10 minutes to LOS; see you over the hill at 131 48. Over.
Okay, Charlie. I'll dump the water as soon as we go around the corner.
Roger. Everything's looking real good now.
Yes. Same here.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Coming up about 4 30 LOS. You're looking great on all your systems. Eagle is purring right along after an hour 30 without any cooling. The PNGS is still looking good. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Will you verify that your rendezvous radar transponder is off? Over.
It's not, but I'll get it off.
Roger. We were seeing - believe it or not, we were seeing some funnies on the Eagle's rendezvous radar, and that was the only theory that we had. It looked like it was a good one.
Good theory.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We are standing by. Everything is looking great here. Over.
Apollo 11. Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. If you guys want it, we've got some news, here, we can read up. Over.
Be pleased to have it.
Roger, Neil. Starting off: Congratulatory messages on the Apollo 11 mission have been pouring into the White House from world leaders in a steady stream all day. Among the latest are telegrams from Prime Minister Harold Wilson of Great Britain and the King of Belgium. The world's press has been dominated by news of Apollo 11. Some newsmen estimate that more than 60 percent of the news used in papers across the country today concerned your mission. The New York Times which, as we mentioned before, has had such a demand for its edition of the paper today (even though it ran 950 000 copies) said it will reprint the whole thing on Thursday as a souvenir edition. And Premier Alexei Kosygin has sent congratulations to you and President Nixon through former Vice President Humphrey who is visiting Russia. The cosmonauts have also issued a statement of congratulations. Humphrey quoted Kosygin as saying "I want you to tell the President and the American people that the Soviet Union desires to work with the United States in the cause of peace."
And Mrs. Robert Goddard said today that her husband would have been so happy. "He wouldn't have shouted or anything. He would just have glowed." She added, "That was his dream, sending a rocket to the Moon." People around the world had many reasons to be happy about the Apollo 11 mission. The Italian police reported that Sunday night was the most crime free night of the year. And in London, a boy who had the faith to bet $5 with a bookie that a man would reach the Moon before 1970 collected $24.000. That's pretty good odds.
You're probably interested in the comments your wives have made. Neil, Jan had said about yesterday's activities, "The evening was unbelievably perfect. It is an honor and a privilege to share with my husband, the crew, the Manned Spacecraft Center, the American public, and all mankind; the magnificent experience of the beginning of lunar exploration." She was then asked if she considered the Moon landing the greatest moment in her life. She said "No, that was the day we were married." And Mike, Pat said simply, "It was fantastically marvelous." Buzz, Joan said - apparently couldn't quite believe the EVA on the Moon. She said, "It was hard to think it was real until the men actually moved. After the Moon touchdown, I wept because I was so happy." But she added, "The best part of the mission will be the splashdown."
In other news, and there was a little bit, another explorer: Thor Heyerdahl had to give up his attempt to sail a papyrus boat across the Atlantic. The storm damaged boat was abandoned about 650 miles from Bermuda. The speed of the craft had been reduced to about 25 miles a day, and Heyerdahl said the object of the voyage had not been to provide an endurance test for the crew.
Looking at the world of sports, let's see here. While you were busy the other day, Joe Namath and football Commissioner Pete Rozelle made the announcement that "Broadway Joe" had agreed to sell his interest in the Bachelors III restaurant and report to the New York Jets. Joe arrived at the Jets' training camp today and had his first workout. Several other Jet players who had held out along with Joe also reported. And Davy Hill, from Jackson, Michigan, won his third major golf in as many starts in the past week. He won the Philadelphia Classic. Hill has won four tournaments so far this year and is the leading money winner this year with a cool $129.000. And in baseball, the west division of the National League remains a tight race. LA and San Francisco are one game behind league leading Atlanta. The Astros have a record of 48 wins and 48 losses, and are now in fifth place, seven games out. A twin bill between the Astros and Cincinnati last night was postponed because of rain. The Chicago Cubs are still in first place in the East Division. They lead the New York Mets by four and one half games. And in the American League, Baltimore is breezing toward the Eastern Division title. They lead second place Boston by 11 games. Looking ahead, the All Star baseball game is scheduled for tomorrow. And President Nixon was scheduled to see the game and then leave immediately after the game for the Pacific splashdown area before going on his tour of Europe. And that about covers the news this day. You guys have been making most of it and I'm sure we couldn't fill you in on any of the details that you don't already know. Out.
Thank you much, Charlie.
You're welcome.
11, Houston. We've got a preliminary TEI 30 PAD, if you're ready to copy.

Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Seven minutes to LOS; next AOS 133 46. You're looking good going over the hill. Out.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're standing by.
Roger. Apollo 11.
Roger. We'd like you, sometime at your convenience, to stir up the CRYO's on this pass. And we're wondering if you got the fuel cell purge. Over.
Roger. *** fuel cell purge ...
Say again. You're breaking up.
Roger. The O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge is complete.
Roger. Copy.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We've got a load for you, if you give us P00 and ACCEPT. The load consists of a CSM pre TEI state vector that's going in the CSM slot, and a post-TEI state vector that'll go into the LM slot, if that's okay; and also a TEI target load. Any comments? Over.
Very good. Thank you very much.
Yes, sir.
P00 and ACCEPT. You got it.
Thank you.
And, 11, Houston. A reminder: you can scratch the VERB 66 at 134 30.
Understand.
And, 11, Houston. For your information, Eagle, we had an ISS fail light came on at about 3 19 due to a CDU overheating; and at about this time at AOS it looks like we're about to lose the platform.
...
Apollo 11, Houston. We got the load in. You can have the computer - -
11. Are you through with the computer?
That's affirmative, Buzz.
All right. That's timing for you.
And, Apollo 11, Houston. Your friendly White Team has your coming home information, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Stand by.
Apollo 11. Ready to copy.
Roger, 11. Got two PADS for you, TEI 30 and then a TEI 31. TEI 30 SPS/G&N: 36691, minus 061, plus 066 135 23 4156. NOUN 81: 32 - correction, plus 32011, plus 06818, minus 02650 181 054 014.

Over.
Roger, Buzz. Good readback. You're very weak. If you're ready to copy, I got a TEI 31 for you. Over.
All right. Go ahead.
Apollo 11, Houston. You were cut out. Say again.
Roger.
All right. Go ahead. I'm ready to copy.
Roger, 11. TEI 31, SPS/G&N: 36691, minus 061, plus 066 137 22 3985, plus 32838, plus 06845, minus 02487, NA, pitch 052. Rest of the PAD is NA. Ready for your readback. Over.

Roger. Good readback. And, Buzz, did you say sextant star is visible after 134 50?
No. I wrote down 134 10. I wasn't real sure about that.
Roger. It went by me there. RETRO caught it. It's 134 50. Over.
Okay. 134 50. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. After the burn, we'd like you to trim X and Z. Over.
Okay, Charlie.
Roger. And that's to 0.2 foot per second, as shown in the flight plan.
Sounds like there's a story behind that one, too.
We'll tell you when you get back.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you verify that you've stirred up the CRYO's? Over.
Roger. We've stirred them up.
Thank you, sir.
Apollo 11, Houston. You are GO for TEI. Over.
Apollo 11. Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You've got about 8 minutes till LOS. Your AOS with the burn, 135 34 05, no burn 135 44. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Apollo 11, Houston. One minute to LOS. Go sic 'em.
Thank you, sir. We'll do it.
Hello Apollo 11. Houston. How did it go? Over.
Time to open up the LRL doors, Charlie.
Roger. We got you coming home. It's well stocked.
Okay, Burn status: DELTA-TIG was zero, burn time was 2 plus 30. PAD angles: DELTA VGX after trim was 0.1, VGY 0.9, VGZ 0.1. DELTA-VC minus 17.9, fuel 10.6, OX 10.4, unbalance minus 50.
Roger. Copy, Neil. Sounds good to us.
And Apollo 11, Houston. All your systems look real good to us. We'll keep you posted.
Roger.
Hey, Charlie boy, looking good here. That was a beautiful burn. They don't come any finer.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. I wondered if you've compared your state vector accuracy with the one in the LM flights? Over.
Yes, sir, and it looked very nice. VERB 83 was plus 00070 and minus 00008.
Roger.
11, Houston. I was looking at your bank Bravo nitrogen tank. It didn't leak a bit - correction - didn't leak a bit this time. Over.
Roger. Looked good here.
Chamber pressure was hanging in there around 100. The latter part, of the burn it started oscillating a little bit and got down a little bit below 100.
Roger.
96 or so.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us P00 in ACCEPT? We've got a REFSMMAT for you. Over.
Okay.
Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We've got the load in. You can go back to BLOCK. Over.
We're there.
Roger.
Your command module film seems to be working out pretty well, Charlie, the amount we carried. Looks like we carried just about what we needed.
Wonderful.
We have one 16 millimeter roll on the ASA 1000 color interior film. We were thinking of shooting that during the entry, out window number 4 on a bracket, and you might get the camera guide sometime in the next couple of days and give us all the good settings for that.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. I wondered if during the TEI burn you utilized the oxidizer flow valve on the PUGS. Over.
Yes, we did. Based on your very excellent briefing I was expecting the thing to continue desiring increase for the whole time, so we started out with it in INCREASE. I saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and started falling about 6 or 7 percent behind, so I was still expecting it to move up, and then I went down to FULL DECREASE and brought it back down to a difference of 2 percent. Over.
Roger. Thank you very much, Buzz.
Two tenths of a percent, I'm sorry.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. You can go to PTC attitude and torque at your - and do the P52 and torque at your convenience. Over.
Hey, we got to take some more pictures, Charlie. Is there any constraint, normally, in staying here for awhile?
No, sir.
Thank you.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
How does that tracking look, or is it too early to tell?
Stand by, Mike.
Apollo 11, Houston. FIDO's are looking at the data. It's too early to tell yet exactly. It's looking real good so far. We'll have you some answers shortly on trajectory. Over.
Okay. What FIDO is that?
That's Jay Green.
Howdy, Jay.
11, Houston. We have a DAP CSM update for you.
Go ahead.
Roger. CSM weight, Mike: 26370. Over.
Thank you, sir.
Welcome.
Apollo 11, Houston. We've taken your onboard vector and propagated it forward, and it's looking real good. We only got about 24 minutes of tracking now. Really too early to tell on the radar. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Mike, did you notice any transients at ignition on TEI? Over.
Yes. The transients were more noticeable than on the previous burns, Charlie. I just wrote it off on the fact we had a light command module, but there was considerable roll activity which dampened down after the first 20 seconds, I would guess, of the burn; but then there was also some pitch and yaw activity. I don't believe it was abnormal, and it seemed to be deadbanding ratherly crisply in roll plus or minus about 8 degrees either side of the center line; and after the first couple of - oh, after the first 20 seconds or so, the gimbals were quiet, and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet. Before that, there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates. Total attitude hung in there pretty well.
Roger. Thank you much. We were looking at the playback, and we saw some things that - right at start up. We'll be back with you later on that.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. Have you finished taking pictures? Over.
We're just finishing up, Charlie.
Roger.
About to get started on the P52 here pretty soon.
Copy.
Another eight or nine of them.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. You can crank up on the PTC at any time. Over.
All right-o.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, 11. This is the original CAP COM. Congratulations on an outstanding job. You guys have really put on a great show up there. I think it's about time you powered down and got a little rest, however. You've had a mighty long day here. Hope you're all going to get a good sleep on the way back. I look forward to seeing you when you get back here. Don't fraternize with any of those bugs enroute except for the Hornet.
Okay. Thank you, boss. We'll - We're looking forward to a little rest and a restful trip back. And see you when we get there.
Roger. You've earned it.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We'd like you to turn off O<sub>2</sub> tank number 1 heaters. Over.
It's off. Thank you.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. For your information, the LGC in Eagle just went belly up at 7 hours. Over.
Okay. Very good, ... death of a real winner, there.
Charlie, we're going to rotate about pitch 270 degrees on the way home vice 1 - or 090 on the way out. Right?
Right, sir.
Okay. VERB 49 maneuver to that attitude is in progress.
Roger.
Houston, crew status report. Radiation: CDR 11017, CMP 10019, LMP 09020. No medication.
Say again, please, Neil. We - you were breaking up. We missed that. Over.
Okay. This is crew status report. Radiation: CDR 11017, CMP 10019, LMP 09020. No medication.
Roger. Thank you.
And we didn't get any crew status report from you this morning. Wondered if you could give us an estimate of sleep last night. Over.
Okay ...
Okay. We'll take a guess, Charlie, and try to give an equivalent amount. Oh, it's CDR 3, and LMP 4.
Roger. Thank you very much.
And, Charlie, you want the fans cycled ... Right?
That's affirmative, and we'd like you to disable quads Charlie and Delta. Over.
Okay. Charlie and Delta.
Apollo 11, Houston. If it's convenient, we'd like to go through your onboard readout. Over.
Of what?
Oh, excuse me. It's on the flight plan, 3102. We'd like BATTS and RCS. Over.
Stand by.
Ready to copy, Houston?
Roger. Go ahead.
BATT Charlie 370, PYRO BATT A 370, BATT B 370; RCS, 55, 65, 64, and 62. Over.
Roger. We copy all that. Thank you much.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of questions for the Moon walkers, if you got a second. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Neil. We're seeing some temperature rises on the passive seismic experiment that are a little higher than normal and were wondering if you could verify the deployed position. We understand it's about 40 feet from the LM in the eleven o'clock position. Over.
No. It's about in the nine or nine thirty position, and I'd say it's about 50 or 60 feet.
Roger. Copy. Also, did you notice - was there any indication of any dust cloud as you lifted off? Over.
Not very much. There was quite a bit of Kapton and parts of the LM that went out in all directions, usually for great distances, as far as I can tell. But I don't remember seeing anything of a dust cloud to speak of.
Roger. Understand all you could see was parts of the LM going out. What was your - your first - first comment? Over.
I don't remember. Just that the Kapton and other parts on the LM staging scattering all around the area for great distances, but I didn't see much dust.
Roger. Thank you very much.
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you keep me honest on the lithium hydroxide changes? When do you have the next one scheduled for?
Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. Mike, on that canister, we had you due to change one at 133 before TEI, and it's on page 399. The next one we got is at 147. Over.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like to extend our damping period for another 5 minutes; let the rates get way down. Over.
11. Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Roger, Charlie. Like to bring you up to date on our chlorination status. In compartment B4, we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven - correction, we have eight pockets for chlorine and buffer ampules, of which - Let me correct that. We have seven pockets, of which one is empty and always has been empty, leaving six remaining. On the other side over there in B7, we have another container with seven pockets, so we have a total of seven plus six, and those are filled with six chlorines and seven buffers. Now, I've been using one chlorine and one buffer per day which, at this point in time, prior to this chlorination I'm about to do, leaves me one chlorine and two buffers. Seems to me I'm one chlorine short, and that being the case, I'd like to ask your advice on postponing this chlorination using the last container until some later date, like maybe tomorrow. Over.
Roger. We copy, Mike. Stand by.
Okay.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Check in A1, Mike, and see what you can find in there. Over.
We think you might have some more chlorine up in A1. Over.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. Do you read? You're breaking up. Over.
Roger. Read.
Roger, 11. You're breaking up. Mike, please look in compartment A1. We think there might be some more chlorine up there. Over.
Eureka!
11, Houston. Reading you about one by. Over.
11, Houston. We're having a downlink problem. That's the reason we can't read you. We're switching sites. Stand by.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. How do you read now? Over.
Fine.
Roger. You're five by now, too, Mike. Thank you much. Did you copy that about A1 on that chlorine?
Eureka!
How about that, sports fans!
Apollo 11, Houston. We're having a little trouble getting the yaw rate damped out to the appropriate value. We'd like you all to be quite like mice for a couple of minutes and let's see if that will help it out. Over.
11, Houston. You did great work there. We're ready to spin it up. Over.
11, Houston. Did you copy? Over.
Yes. We read you, Charlie. Would you stand by a minute?
Roger. No hurry.
11, Houston. Shift change time, here. White Team bids you good night; we'll see you tomorrow. Over.
Good night, Charlie. Thank you.
Good night, Charlie. Thank you.
Adios.
Adios. Thanks again for a great show, you guys.
Thanks for a great job down there.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Good morning, Ron.
Howdy there, Mike. We're ready to go ahead and have you switch to your OMNI positions for your sleep period, and we would like the following high gain switch positions: your high gain antenna in MANUAL, beam width WIDE, pitch is minus 50, and yaw is a plus 270. And just follow the flight plan for remaining COMM configuration. Over.
Roger. Out.
You "Purple" people keep funny hours.
Your COMM is pretty weak at this point, Mike. Please say again.
Roger. Disregard.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
It's on the way now.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like for you to go ahead and put your S band antenna OMNI to OMNI and OMNI B. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. How do you read me through Honeysuckle now? Over.
You're loud and clear. Over.
Very good. Reading you better now. And did you copy we'd appreciate going S band OMNI and OMNI B at this time? Over.
That's the configuration we're in.
Okay. Thank you.
I'll say you "Purple" people keep funny hours.
Good afternoon, Houston. Apollo 11. Over.
Good morning, 11. This is Houston. Over.
Okay. Crew status report: 88 and 8.5.
Roger. 88 and 8.5. When you're ready, we've got a small flight plan update for you.
Houston, we're ready to copy.
Roger. At about 148 hours, if you've not already done so, a CO<sub>2</sub> filter change, and the H<sub>2</sub> purge line heater on 20 minutes before the O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> purge. At 148 hours, we'd like you to initiate a charge on battery Alfa instead of at 151 hours, and leave the charge on until we notify you further. At 150 hours GET, waste water dump to 10 percent. We do plan to burn midcourse correction 5. It will be an RCS burn about 5 feet per second at about the nominal time in the flight plan. Over.
Roger. Understand. We'll be accomplishing the filter change shortly, the purge line heater is on ***, O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> purge shortly, and at 148 will initiate a charge on battery A until you notify us further. At 150 hours, waste water dump to 10 percent. And we're looking forward to midcourse correction 5 at about 5 feet per second at the nominal time. Over.
Roger. I've got your consumables update, if you're ready to copy.
Copy.
Okay. At GET of 147 plus 00, RCS total minus 2.0 percent, which is about minus 14 pounds. Alfa minus 12.0, Bravo plus 10.0, minus 3.0, minus 2.0. Hydrogen total minus 1.5 pounds, O<sub>2</sub> total plus 20 pounds. Over.
Roger. I copy, and our onboard readouts: Alfa, *** 2 percent, Bravo 54 percent, Cocoa's 64 percent, Delta 61 percent. Over.
Roger, 11. Would you read that quad Alfa again, please, Buzz. You're cutting out. It may be - are you operating on VOX? Over.
Negative. Alfa is 53 percent. Over.
Roger. We copy.
11, from down here on telemetry, all your systems look to be in good shape.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. Would you ask Buzz to check his biomedical TM sensors for a loose or dried out sensor? We're getting an erratic electrocardiogram reading. That would be one of the three sternal leads. Over.
Okay.
...
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Say again your last, please.
Disregard.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Stand by for a Mark leaving the lunar sphere of influence.
MARK.
You're leaving the lunar sphere of influence. Over.
Roger. Is Bill Shaffer down there?
Negative. But we've got a highly qualified team on in his stead.
Roger. I wanted to hear him explain it again to the press conference.
Okay.
That's old Apollo 8 junk, but tell him the spacecraft gave a little jump as it went through the ...
Okay. I'll pass it on to him. Thanks a lot, and Dave Reed is sort of burying his head in his arms right now.
Roger. Out.
Those guys down there in the press room did a pretty good job this morning.
Yes, they have.
We don't want them to give up yet, though.
No. They'll hang in there for about another 47 hours or so.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you're not busy now, I can read you up the morning news.
Okay. We're all listening.
Say again, 11?
Roger. We're all listening. Go ahead.
Roger. From the hot wires of the Public Affairs Office: Apollo 11 still dominates the news around the world. Only four nations, Communist China, North Korea, North Viet Nam, and Albania, have not yet informed their citizens of your flight and landing on the Moon. One newsman said that he has run out of ways to describe your success. Tonight, President Nixon is scheduled to watch the All Star baseball game in Washington. After the game, he will depart for the Pacific recovery area. Wednesday evening, he will fly from Johnston Island by helicopter to the Navy communications ship Arlington. Then on Thursday morning, he will reboard the helicopter and fly to the Hornet in time to witness your splashdown. Accompanying the President will be Secretary of State William Rogers and Frank Borman. They will watch the splashdown from the bridge of the recovery ship with Admiral John Sidney McCain, Jr., Commander of the Pacific Forces. Following the President's stay aboard the Hornet, he will depart for his tour of Asia and scheduled visit to Romania. Luna 15 is believed to have crashed into the Sea of Crises yesterday after orbiting the Moon 52 times. The Soviet News Agency TASS reported that "scientific" "research in near Moon space was carried out." Sir Bernard Lovell at Jodrell Bank Observatory said that Luna 15 hit the surface of the Moon at a speed of about 300 miles per hour. Things have been relatively quiet recently in Viet Nam. GI's on patrol were observed carrying transistor radios tuned into your flight. The Armed Forces radio and TV network in Viet Nam gave the mission full coverage. Skirmishes still continue between the Egyptians and Israelis along the Suez Canal. U.N. observers there are trying to halt the action. In Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee has voted to reduce the 27.5 percent oil depletion allowance to 20 percent. We've had rain several times here in the Houston area. Today it is cloudy, and more showers are expected. On the sports front, as we mentioned earlier, the All Star game is tonight. There were no games played yesterday. Last night in New York, the Baseball Writers Association of America named Babe Ruth the greatest ball player of all time. Joe DiMaggio was named the greatest living ball player. Frank Borman made the announcements at a dinner honoring the players. Joe Namath put in a full day at the New York Jets' training camp. Five policemen had a hard time restraining about 500 kids who wanted to touch Broadway Joe. He said he feels fine and will play in the All Star game August 1, if Coach Weeb Eubank lets him. The Oilers' camp at Kerrville got wet yesterday, but the workouts continued. There have been some minor injuries, but nothing too serious. Coach Wally Lemm is satisfied so far with the workouts. The Oilers are expecting attendance by over 30.000 for the preseason game with Buffalo. Apparently, Don Meredith's announced retirement isn't expected to dampen enthusiasm, especially around here in Houston. Mario Andretti won the 200 mile Trenton Auto Race Sunday and is now the leading race driver in the U.S. Auto Club's point standings. And that's about the summary of the morning news this afternoon in Houston. Over.
Look up the Dow Jones Industrials for us.
Roger. Stand by a minute, please.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We see you in P00. When you can give us ACCEPT, we have a state vector and target load uplink ready for you.
Roger, Houston. I'm going ahead and start the computer.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 11, we've completed the uplink. The computer's yours.
Thank you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. With respect to the Dow Jones industrials, since closing on Tuesday afternoon the 15th up to about 1:05 p.m. Houston time this afternoon, why, the effect has been a net drop; that is, minus 6 points on the industrial average. So far today since opening, the Dow Jones industrial average has gone down by 11.05 after rising 1 1/2 shortly after opening. Today's performance on the utilities is a drop of 1.63, and railroads a drop of 1.58. Over.
Every flight has to have some disadvantages, I guess.
Roger. There is some speculation that you all are responsible for that 1 1/2 point rise right after opening.
Well, don't blame the 11 point drop on us, anyway.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you have a minute or so free, I wonder if we could get Mike to give us a little bit of clarification on what happened around about the time of docking. We copied him as mentioning that contact was very smooth, almost imperceptible; and we're a little bit inquisitive or curious about his remarks as to what happened after probe retraction. Over.
Roger. I docked in CMC AUTO, and as I said, I wasn't really sure of the moment of contact. I kept cross checking the docking probe indicators. I got two barber poles indicating that the three capture latches - not capture latches, but the three ... latches had made, and we were soft docked. And at that time the situation looked very stable. So, I went to CMC FREE, glanced back out the window and it still looked stable; and I fired primary 2 bottle. And at that time, a gyration began between the two vehicles due I'm not sure to what. Perhaps the LM thrusting or perhaps it was building up prior, and I hadn't noticed it. But anyway, during the RETRACT of the probe, there were yaw - my yaw excursions of, I would guess, around 15 degrees, and I had to come back on, take the FREE switch and throw it back to AUTO, and try to damp them out; and I guess Neil was doing the same in the LM. I'll let him tell you about his side of it. And I though that we were not going to get a successful RETRACT and hard dock. However, in about - oh, I guess 6 or 8 seconds, I did hear - could see the situation damping out, and then we heard the noise indicating the docking latches had fired; and later on when I got into the tunnel, all 12 of them had properly engaged.
Roger.
And on the LM side, we were in AGS MIN deadband ATT HOLD; and at contact, I thrusted plus X; and shortly after that we had a sizable attitude oscillation and thruster firing, so we opened up the deadband to MAX and manually flew the vehicle into stable attitude during the retraction. It went to OFF after ...
Roger. Thank you very much. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. I have your midcourse correction 5 PAD available when you're ready to copy.
Stand by.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy.
11, this is Houston. Midcourse correction number 5, RCS/G&N: 26025, pitch and yaw trim NA, TIG 150 29 5453, minus 00048, plus all balls, plus 00001 075 159 328; HA is NA; HP plus 00230 00048 011 00048; sextant star 03 0908 382. Boresite star block, none available. Latitude plus 1102, minus 17204 11803 36275 195 03 33, GDC align, Deneb and Vega, 007 144 068, no ullage, of course, four quad thrusting. Over. Readback.
Roger. Midcourse number 5, RCS/G&N: 26025, pitch and yaw NA, 150 29 5453, minus 00048, plus all zeros, plus 00001 075 159 328, NA, plus 00230 00048 011 00048 03 0908 382, NA three times, plus 1102, minus 17204 11803 36275 195 03 33, Deneb and Vega, 007 144 068, and four quads for the burn. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Readback correct. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. If Neil has a free minute, we've got a question or two regarding the CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure and water in the suit loop discrepancies noted yesterday. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, 11. Was water noted in both suits or only in yours, Neil?
I think only in my suit.
Okay. Can you locate that occurrence for us in time when you first noticed water in the suit, either by mission time or relation to any particular event?
I think it was after insertion sometime, Bruce. I don't remember exactly when. I - It was when we were in orbit and had our - after we took our helmets off.
Roger. Did you call it to us when you first noticed it, or was it sometime after when you called it?
I'd guess it might have been probably 20 minutes after I noticed it that I mentioned it to you.
Roger. Was this noticing the water accompanied by erratic CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure readings, or was that a separate problem? Over.
Well, the water problem evidenced itself before we noted any erratic motions of the PC02 gage.
Roger. And what was the relative sequence on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary CO<sub>2</sub> canister; that is, did you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary CO<sub>2</sub>? Over.
I believe we went to secondary CO<sub>2</sub> first.
Secondary hydroxide - lithium hydroxide.
Roger. We copy. And was there any change in your suit loop - -
No.
Go ahead.
I should mention, Bruce, that when I went to water secondary - water separator to secondary there, I didn't notice any change. But about after 15 minutes or 20 minutes, the water stopped coming out. So maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out, but the secondary water separator was operating properly.
Roger. Did you make any changes in the suit loop configuration after you went from the egress mode to the cabin mode after insertion; that is, in particular, they're interested in knowing if you recall changing the diverter valve position to EGRESS at any time while you were on the secondary canister? Over.
No. I don't believe we did that at all, Bruce.
Okay, 11. Thank you. That sums up our questions for now, and we'll crank these back into the engineering pipeline and see what we can come up with.
Okay. Are you satisfied that the CO<sub>2</sub> circuit breaker was in on jettison? Over.
Say again, please?
Roger. On LM jettison, are you satisfied that the CO<sub>2</sub> circuit breaker was in? Over.
Yes. It was in.
Roger. Could you confirm that? I thought there was some question after we got into the command module as to whether that had been left in or not. Over.
Roger, 11. It was in and confirmed in, and the readings after jettison stayed about 0.1 to 0.2.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We have not noticed any change in the signal coming through on the LMP's EKG. When he has a little free time, we'd like him to check into it again. Over.
Roger. I looked at all three of the upper chest center ones, and they appear to be fairly tight. I'll push them back in again. Over.
Roger. On the TM here, we noticed some fluctuations that may have been attributed to your moving the sensors around or pushing on them, but the erratic problem seems to be persisting.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. I wonder if you've noticed any change in the BIOMED returns you're getting. Over.
Negative, Buzz. It still looks kind of bad. Apparently, when you move around, it's cutting in and out. Have you checked the little electrical connector where it goes into the signal conditioner? Over.
Yes. They're all about as tight as can be. I tell you what; I'll take them off and put them back on again and see if that makes any difference.
Okay. If you would, at your convenience, we'll be watching it down here.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We'd like you to try acquisition on the high gain antenna for us at pitch minus 90, yaw 270. Over.
Roger. That's in work.
Roger. Out.
11, this is Houston. We're showing about 6.8 percent on waste water on our telemetry now. Over.
Okay. We've got about 9, up here. Over.
Roger. Out.
11, Houston. We're standing by for your burn. Everything's looking good from down here.
Thank you, Bruce. You've got about a minute and 20 seconds.
Roger. We concur.
Houston, do you copy our residuals?
Roger. We've got your residual fuel counter reading for us.
DELTA-VC is plus 0.2.
Roger. Plus 0.2.
That was actually plus 100.2. Okay?
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. We're in PTC attitude and would you please give us a call when our thruster activity has subsided sufficiently?
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're going to hand over from Madrid to Goldstone at 151 hours even. If you should lose lock on the high gain at this time, you may require at pitch minus 45, yaw 270. Break. We're still watching your rates. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
This is 11, Houston.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, we're still seeing rates on your spacecraft above those we would like for the continuation of the PTC mode which we are still monitoring, and we'll advise you when it has settled down. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are go for the spinup on PTC. Over.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. It didn't like it that time. When I got down to the entry 27303 ENTER, it took off in roll at a high rate in excess of 1 degree per second. Over. I've stopped it now, and we are going to have to go back and do it over again. I'd like to try to find out the reason it did that.
Roger. You might as well start setting up for it, and we will be working the problem here.
Okay. Do you have us on high bit rate here now?
That's affirmative.
Okay, good. I'll maneuver back to PTC initiation attitude while you guys look at the data and see what you think.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. I think the reason is in having 1620 on the DSKY during the subsequent entries, or at least that's one possibility.
Roger. We'll check it out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. While you're waiting for the CSM to settle down and for us to look at the tapes on your latest maneuver, would you feel like answering some more questions with relation to the lunar surface? Over.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. For 64 thousand dollars, we're still trying to work out the location of your landing site, Tranquility Base. We think it is located on LAM 2 chart at Juliet 0.5 and 7.8. Do you still have those charts on board? Over.
Yes. Stand by one. They're packed.
Roger. You may not have to unpack it. The position which I just gave you is slightly west of West Crater. I guess it's about two tenths of a kilometer west of it, and we were wondering if Neil or Buzz had observed any additional landmarks during descent, lunar stay, or ascent which would confirm or disprove this. One thing that we're wondering about is that if you were at this position, you would have seen the Cat's Paw during ascent just up to the north of your track. Over.
We were looking for the Cat's Paw, too, thinking we were probably downrange, beyond the Big V. But I think that it's likely that that might have been West Crater that we went across in landing, but - Stand by.
We're hoping, Bruce, that our 16 mm film was working at that point in descent, and we'll be able to confirm our touchdown position. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters, and crater rows, and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't been able to yet.
Roger. And the next question from our panel is for Buzz. We recall that he reported seeing a laser upon AOS of the Earth the first time after - the first REV after ascent, and we're wondering what color the beam was and if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the Earth. Over.
It was mostly white, perhaps a tinge of yellowish color to it; and it seemed to be - as I recall it, the terminator of the Earth was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from - down towards the terminator of the Earth - from the opposite horizon. That's a third to a quarter Earth radii. Over.
Roger. And that puts it in the light side? Over.
Roger. Yes, it was in the light side. The Earth was about - a two thirds lit Earth, with the terminator down toward the horizon. And now coming from the opposite limb of the Earth, the sunlight limb, coming down about one quarter to one third of a radius in from the limb. Generally, pensively located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular to the terminator that goes through the center. Over.
Roger, Buzz. We copy.
And I got pictures of that. I'm sure that will show up.
And I saw that, too. It was a very bright spot of light and I confirm Buzz's observation of its position.
Okay, 11. Very good. Now, with respect to the documented sample container: on television it appeared to us as though the samples for that container were in fact being given - being selected in accordance with some thought or consideration being given to the rocks themselves. And we were wondering if you could give any further details from memory about any of these samples, and the context of the material or the surface from which they were taken. Over.
Yes. You remember I initially started on the cut side of the LM that the TV camera was on, and I took a number of samples of rocks on the surface, and several that were just subsurface - about 20 - 15 to 20 feet north of the LM. And then I recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so I crossed over to the southern side of the LM, and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that we commented on, and several beyond that, and tried to take as many different types - of rock types as I could see by eye - as I could in the short time we had available. There were a number of other samples that I had seen earlier in our stroll around the LM that I had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sample, but I didn't get those, and I'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session.
Roger. Did you observe any small craters with conspicuously blocky rims? Over.
Well, aside from the one big one that we went over, I guess there were none in our area. I took a stroll back after putting up the EASEP, and while Buzz was starting to unpack the documented samples - took a stroll back to a crater behind us that was maybe 70 or 80 feet in diameter and 15 or 20 feet deep, and took some pictures of it. It had rocks in the bottom of pretty good size, considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface, but there was no - we apparently, at 15 feet or so, had not gotten below the regolith. We were essentially showing no bedrock, at least in the walls of the crater at that depth. Over.
Roger. We copy,
Okay. Thank you, Neil. That about wraps up the questions we have on hand for now.
Okay.
My compliments to the chef. The food is outstanding. This cream of chicken soup I give at least three spoons.
Okay. Cream of chicken, three spoons.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
11, we concur that having VERB 16, NOUN 20 up on the DSKY may well have had some effect on your PTC initiation. It looks like this would give - let the computer work with a knowledge of the actual CDU angles. What we'd like you to do is do a CDU zero which is VERB 40, NOUN 20, ENTER, and then start the PTC procedure again at step 2 with loading VERB 6, NOUN 22, desired attitude in the AUTO maneuver, and all that. Over.
Okay. The only thing I don't understand about that is why it took off at the rate it did. What rate should it have taken off at under that theory?
Stand by a minute, Mike.
11, CMP, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Mike, over here on page 9 7 of your checklist where we're setting up PTC, there's been a note penciled in after, "Wait 20 minutes for rate to damp. Do not monitor VERB 16, NOUN 20." It turns out that the significance of that is that, if you are monitoring 16 NOUN 20, then when you get down here in step 7, the second time you do a VERB 24, you've got to reload the NOUN 01 to make it VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER, before you load the three registers. Over.
Roger, that. I was just questioning the rate at which the maneuver would begin if that were not done.
Roger. We're still working on computing the rate for you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. We'd like you to select REACQ mode on the high gain antenna. Looks like we're about to lose you. Over.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston broadcasting in the blind. If you read us, attempt to acquire on OMNI antennas. Attempt to acquire us on OMNI antennas, if you read. This is Houston. Out.

Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston. Radio check. Over.
...
Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear, Bruce. How me?
Roger. What antenna are you using?
Houston, Apollo 11 is calling you on the high gain. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Loud and clear on the high gain.
So what's new?
Oh, we were wondering what was new with you up there.
It's all very quiet. We're just sitting here letting the thruster firing damp down. When they get good enough, let us know, and we'll start this PTC.
Roger.
Nice to sit here and watch the Earth getting larger and larger and the Moon smaller and smaller.
Roger. We'll give you a call when your rates have damped down sufficiently, and we're unable at the present time to predict what rate you should have seen at your last attempt to initiate PTC. We saw about 2 1/2 degrees per second. Over.
Yes. I believe that.
Buzz thinks we should have a PTC program built in the computer. He could very well be right.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. I was just checking the radios, and how is the thruster activity coming?
11, Houston. The radios are still in good shape, and we are still waiting for your rates to decay. We've got 0.03 degrees per second in pitch now.
Okay. We're - we're in no rush. This is a very pleasant attitude, as a matter of fact. The Sun is down in the LEB, so it's not shining through the windows and heating the place up. We've got the Earth steady out window 1. We have the Moon steadily out window 3 and, of course, we are locked up on the high gain. So as long as the thermal people are happy, we're happy.
Roger. We copy.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, 11. We are about ready to start PTC. I would like to give you some high gain antenna angles, though. We'd like to operate in the REACQ mode, and do you plan on spinning up in the positive or negative direction? Over.
We can do it either way. I had planned the positive.
Okay. For positive, the high gain antenna setting should be pitch plus 30, yaw 270, and in REACQ. Over.
Understand. REACQ, pitch plus 30, yaw 270. Thank you.
Roger. And if you would, when you're making your DSKY entries to set up for PTC, go a little slower, and we'll try to follow each entry from down here. Over.
Roger. Out.
Houston, 11. PTC established.
Roger, 11.
11, Houston. We observe the PTC to be fairly well established here, and we'll keep you posted on how it's going, and your friendly White Team commentator is taking over now.
Okay. Thanks to all you Black Team.
That was the Green Team.
Correction, all you Green Team - correction, Green Team. Excuse me.
Roger. Out.
How could I forget. I used to be a "Green" one.
Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. Your White Team is now on. We're standing by for an exciting evening of TV and a presleep report. Over.
(Unidentifiable Noise)
(Laughter)
Apollo 11, Houston. You sure you don't have anybody else in there with you?
Houston, Apollo 11. Say again, please.
We had some strange noises coming down on the downlink, and it sounded like you had some friends up there.
Where - where do the White Team go during their off hours anyway?
Say again.
(Unidentifiable Noise)
(Unidentifiable Noise)
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Would you ver - We've lost COMM with you for about the last 10 minutes. Would you verify that the S band track switch is in REACQ? Over.
Negative. It's not. The last time we broke lock, we went to AUTO, and I left it there. Sorry.
Roger. We'd like to have you to put it in REACQ, and monitor. In about 2 minutes, we'll be coming up on the high gain. Would you monitor the REACQ? If it doesn't take, acquire manually. Over.
Okay. Say again the angles you'd like.
We'll - we'll try to switch it ourselves. Stand by on the angles.
Buzz, it's pitch plus 30, yaw 270. Over.
Roger. I've got them.
Thank you.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you please terminate battery charge now? Over.
Roger. Terminating battery charge.
Roger.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Any special attitude you'd like us to look at for the TV? Over.
I don't guess we have a requirement there, Charlie.
Roger. We have an attitude that we can get the Earth out of a window or the Moon. We're trying to look at - find one that we can get both, if that's what you'd like. Over.
A 50 degree roll attitude will probably give us that, Joe.
Roger.
That's a good one because it puts the Earth out window 1 and the Moon out window 3 and puts the Sun down in the LEB, so the lighting in here remains relatively constant.
Roger. Well, we'll just stop on the 50 roll, then, and we'll give you the word when to do that. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. We'll have high gain coverage about 155 30. At that time, you can turn on the TV if you desire, and continue your roll around until you get 50 degrees roll. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. We were going to give you the All Star game tonight, but it was rained out. Over.
...
11, Houston. We're on the high gain. You can warm up the SM now if you like. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. We see you coming up on 50 roll. How does that attitude look? Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready for the TV; we're all configured. At your convenience. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, 11. Over.
Are you picking up our TV signals?
That's affirmative. We have it up on the Eidephor now. The focus is a little bit out. We see the Earth in the center of the screen. Still have a little white dot in the bottom of the camera, apparently. And see some landmasses in the center, at least I guess that's what it is. It's very hazy at this time on our Eidephor. Over.
Let me change - -
Believe that's where we just came from.
It is, huh? Well, I'm really looking at the bad - at a bad screen here. Stand by one. Hey, you're right.
It's not bad enough not finding the right landing spot - -
... screen now.
It's not bad enough not finding the right landing spot when you haven't even got the right planet!
I'll never live that one down.
We're making it get smaller and smaller here to make sure that it really is the one we're leaving.
All right. That's enough you guys.
11, that was a good picture there.
Okay. That's enough of the Moon.
Okay. That's enough of the Moon, Charlie. We're getting set up now for some inside pictures.
Roger.
We know there's a lot of scientists from a number of countries standing by to see the lunar samples, and we thought you'd be interested to see them as they really are here. These two boxes are the sample return containers. They - They're vacuum packed containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar surface, sealed, and then brought inside the LM and put inside these fiber glass bags, zippered, and resealed around the outside, and placed in these receptacles in the side of the command module. These are the two boxes. And as soon as we get onto the ship, I'm sure these boxes will immediately be transferred and delivery started to the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. These boxes include the samples of the various types of rock, the groundmass of the soil, the sand and silt, and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment, and the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface.
Roger, Neil. Thank you much for that description. We've got a pretty dark picture down here. Could you check your f stop? We'd like to have it - See if you can open it up a little bit. Over.
Okay. Our monitor showed that to be very bright.
Roger.
... We're down around between, well around f:4, which we thought would be plenty light. Well, we'll lighten it up some more.
Well, we'd appreciate it. It's pretty dark on all our monitors here.
Okay. Fine.
It's looking a lot better now, Neil.
There's Buzz.
11, Houston. We have an excellent picture now. Over.
Okay. How do you read me, Charlie?
Five by now, Buzz. Over.
Okay. The more mundane affairs, now that we've left the Moon, I'd like to trace through them a little bit for you *** developments that have taken place in the food department. I'm sure you've already *** type of a drink container. A little later, Mike will show you how the water gun operates with its new filter to take out the hydrogen. Essentially, this water gun is put in this end and fills up this bag with water, and the drink then dissolves in the water, and this end of the *** outfeeding. Likewise, we have other foods that are more solid nature. You can probably see this shrimp cocktail meal. *** this afternoon while the two of us had salmon salad. *** another early development was the use of bite size food ***
11, Houston. Buzz, you're breaking up badly. Will you check your VOX? Over.
Roger. How am I coming through now, Charlie?
Roger. You're very clear when you come through. It's just that your VOX is not keying at every word. Over.
Okay. These bite sized objects were designed to remove the problem of having so many crumbs floating around in the cabin, so they designed a particular size that would be able to go to the mouth all at once. I think since all of our experience, we've discovered that we could progress a good bit further than that back some of the type meals that we have on Earth. As a matter of fact, on this flight we've carried along pieces of bread, and along with the bread we have a ham spread; and I'll show you, I hope, how easy it is to spread some ham while I'm in zero g.
I think we've discovered that it is quite easy to *** you're all very familiar with.
Apollo 11, Houston. We notice your roll rate increasing. Will you please see if you can bring that down to about 04 or we'll be losing high gain shortly. Over.
You can also use zero gravity to demonstrate many things that we've all learned in school. I'd like to demonstrate briefly how easy it is to explain the action of the gyroscope. If I spin this can, we know that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that once this is given a spin, and has a spin axis in this direction, if we give it a particular torque, and I'll do this by pushing my hands against it in this fashion once it's spinning. By the equations we can predict that, as I put this torque on it, it will in fact rotate this direction. Let's see how well this works out.
See that as I apply the torque this way, it's rotated this way.
Too close, I think.
11, Houston. It's a pretty good demonstration.
Houston, this next is a little demonstration for the kids at home, all kids everywhere, for that matter. I was going to show you how you drink water out of a spoon, but I'm afraid I filled the spoon too full and if I'm not careful, I'm going to spill water right over the sides. Can you see the water slopping around on the top of the spoon, kids?
That's affirmative, 11.
Okay. Well, as I said, I was going to show you but I'm afraid I filled it too full and it's going to spill over the sides. I'll tell you what. I'll just turn this one over and get rid of the water and start all over again. Okay?
Okay.
And you can see, up here we don't know where over is. One up is as good as another. That really is water, though. I'll show you.
That's really not the way we drink. We really have a water gun which I'll show you.
Here's the water gun. This cylindrical thing on the end of it is a filter with several membranes: one allows water to pass, but not any gas; the other allows gas to pass, but not any water. So, by routing the gaseous water which comes from our tank through this filter, we're enabled to drink purified water without the gas in it, filtered water. And, of course, all we do to - to get it started is just pull the trigger.
It's sort of messy. I haven't been at this very long. It's sort of the same system that the Spaniards used to drink out of wineskins at bull fights, only I think this is even more fun. Well, be seeing you, kids.
Thank you from all us kids in the world, here in the MOCR, who can't tell the Earth from the Moon.
Roger. Stand by one, and we'll get you that Earth one.
Looks like you need a wine skin up there, Mike.
That'd be nice.
Okay.
11, Houston - -
You have a picture now, Houston?
That's affirmative. I refuse to bite on this one, though. You tell us.
Okay. This should be getting larger, and if it is, it's the place we're coming home to.
Roger.
No matter where you travel, it's always nice to get home.
We concur, 11. We'll be happy to have you back.
This is Apollo 11. Signing off.
Roger. Thank you very much, 11. That was a good demonstration and a good show. We appreciate it very much.
Apollo 11, Houston. We were curious to see if there was any excess moisture up around the tunnel hatch area as we saw on 10. Over.
It just so happens that's what we were talking about now. There is a little bit of dampness around the outside edge of the hatch, but a very, very slight amount. We've got a hose up there that we're hoping will sort of help keep it a little bit dry.
Roger, Mike. Thank you much. Have you seen any more water collecting on the aft bulkhead? Over.
No, we haven't, as a matter of fact. It's been dry in that area since we got rid of that last time.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 11 is back in PTC attitude. Standing by for thruster quieting.
Roger. We see that. Thank you much, Mike.
Houston, Apollo 11. Could you get a little summary of the evening news for us?
Yes, sir. We'll have it for you momentarily. Also, a little flight plan update, Mike. If you - On page 3 113, you can delete the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge. Over.
Will do.
There is a flurry of activity in the PAO site for the evening news.
Bully.
How's the weather down there? You got any rain?
Roger. We've been having a little bit, thunderstorm type, the last couple of days. We had a pretty good rain today, and it's been overcast. A slow storm system's been moving through the area in the last couple of days, and primarily evening and afternoon thundershowers.
Roger. We were watching a few clouds in your area through the monocular along the Texas Gulf Coast this afternoon, and we also noticed there were clouds over Baja California, which is a little bit unusual.
Roger. Thank you for the weather report. We can't quite see that far. It seems to have cleared up outside now, according to some of the people coming in. This constant overcast in the MOCR here is a little hard to see outside.
Yes. We also noticed it was a little overcast down over - in the Antarctic ice cap, too.
Roger. It's apparently raining pretty hard up - -
How's that for one-upsmanship?
Yes. (Laughter).
He may know that, but he doesn't even know whether his grass is wet or dry.
It's apparently raining fairly hard up in Washington where the All Star game was to be played tonight. They started out, I understand, and then it was rained out and they called it off.
They need a roof on their stadium so they can catch all those flys.
Roger.
In the rain.
Touché.
Hey, Charlie, what's the preliminary outlook for the weather in our recovery area?
Stand by Buzz. It looks pretty good as far as I could tell. We got the - along the tropical convergence line there, there's a few clouds shown on the weather map I'm looking at here, but nothing of significance. Right now - Stand by. Let's see, right now in the mid - yes, at the MPL - we've got 3000 scattered, visibility 10, waves height 3 feet, is the present weather. I don't think there's anything forecast to be of significance. There are a couple of - FLIGHT just informed me that what I just gave you was the forecast. are a couple of tropical storms in the - well, not in the area of landing but in the Pacific. A storm called Claudia which is north - correction - about east of Hawaii. It's going northwest and dissipating. And there's one called Viola, which is out over Guam, and so they aren't any factor at all. It looks like it's going to be real nice for recovery.
Navy called up those special calm seas for you guys from up there on the Hudson.
Well, we might need it. We'll get a look at it tomorrow, I guess, though. We'll probably be giving it a pretty close eye.
Roger.
11, Houston. The RETRO's were wondering if you could fill us in on any non nominal stowage that we have on board. Just location and weight is about all they're interested in. Over.
Roger. We'll do some work on that and let you know, Charlie.
Thank you, sir.
And, Apollo 11, Houston. Would you please place O<sub>2</sub> tank 1 heater to AUTO? Over.
AUTO it is.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead.
What we'll do Charlie, tomorrow, is go through and reconfigure our stowage as closely as possible to nominal. Some things that will not be nominal are as follows: the EVA visors were brought back into the command module, and we have not yet found a home for them. We'll let you know where they go. In addition, there's about 5 pounds of miscellaneous weight from the LM in compartment Able 8, and it's taking the place of the LCG's which we moved from A 8 into the suit bag. We got rid of one miscellaneous trash bag, mostly old food wrapping and also old underwear and that helmet protective visor of the CMP's. We left all that with Eagle. And those are about the only off nominals we have.
Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Out.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. We got the rates looking copasetic. You can go ahead and initiate PTC. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
And Buzz, we're still not getting any data from your EKG. It looks like the only way that we're going to be able to get any is if, at your convenience, you would take your - change out your EKG leads, which are the center ones that are connected to the blue pin; and there's a spare one in the medical box. Over.
Roger. How many did you want me to change?
Just the center one. I'll get the right nomenclature from the Doc. Stand by. It's called the sternal EKG, which are the three center ones, and it's got - they lead into a - into the blue stringed lead ones. Over.
Okay. There's three of them, is that right?
That's affirmative.
And you want me to change all three.
That's affirmative and they're all hooked together from the picture I'm looking at, and they go into the center belt, signal conditioner, and it's got the blue strain relief on it.
Yes. I checked the connectors at both ends on that. I don't guess we have a spare signal conditioner or anything like that, do we?
No. We do not.
Well, I can show you my heart's still working.
We believe it.
Charlie, what we suggest here is, before we start that, turn our two suit powers off and plug his blue lead into my blue signal conditioner and see if we can get his signal through my signal conditioner. Okay?
Roger. That's a good suggestion, Neil. We concur. Over.
Okay, Charlie. We're transmitting, and let's see if you get any EKG signal on the CDR at this point.
Roger. Stand by.
11, Houston. We get some data, but it's got the same problem that we had through Buzz's signal conditioner, so apparently the lead is broken and we'd like you to change it out if you could. Over.
Okay.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, sir.
Roger. I think the problem was that the center lead had dried out. ... put the new one on, and I'll see how that works. Over.
Roger.
I can't tell you how good it feels to get it off.
Yes. I can imagine.
Houston, Apollo 11. Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Roger. How do you read my EKG now?
Stand by. We'll let the docs look at it. Buzz, we're on low bit rate. We'll get you on a high gain momentarily, and we'll let you know then. Over.
Okay. I got my high gain antenna coming out.
Roger. Just leave on REACQ. We'll get you.
Apollo 11, Houston. Buzz, your EKG looks good now. The doc said thanks a lot.
Okay. They're welcome.
Apollo 11, Houston. Based on our sighting since the midcourse, we're showing a gamma of minus 6.57. This is preliminary, though, and we think that after some more tracking it should come on in, and we could tweak it right on into the corridor. It's just about in the center of the corridor; everything's looking fine. We'll have you an entry PAD in a couple of hours before you go to sleep. And from our friends in public affairs, a few headlines, other than your flight. You're still dominating the news. However, there are some other things of interest for you. As I mentioned earlier, the All Star game was rained out. It's going to be played tomorrow. However, President Nixon will not be able to see it as he planned. We'll keep you posted on results. And, also, the weathermen are going to be good to you. Our forecast is, looks like it's holding good for the recovery area; it should be real fine out there. President Nixon, as he prepares to fly out to greet your return, predicted that within 31 years man will have visited at least one other planet bearing some form of life. "In the year 2000, we, on this Earth, will have visited new worlds where there will be a form of life," he told 2000 foreign exchange students at the White House. Before he left for his week long trip, the President sent Congress his proposal for organizing - reorganizing the Interstate Commerce Commission. He also conferred with chairman Earl Wheeler of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on his return from Viet Nam, and the launch of Intelstat was scrubbed and has been rescheduled for 10 p.m., eastern daylight time on Wednesday. The second stage fuel ground support system showed some contamination.
And back in Washington, the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to tax changes affecting oil companies, banks, and utilities that could add nearly 2 billion a year to federal revenue. And, also today, NASA announced it will launch a large orbital workshop in 1972, with a cutdown version of the Saturn V. And, your television pictures attracted a lot of interest. They were shown live throughout just about the whole world, and, we're expecting hundreds of telephone calls from mothers all over the world complaining that their youngsters are trying to drink milk from spoons, thanks to you, Mike.
I take it all back.
You need more practice.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Buzz, you brought the surgeon right out of his chair. We see you exercising. Over.
Say again.
We see you exercising. Is that correct, Buzz?
Yes, that's right. Buzz is.
Roger. We've got his heartbeat way up.
Right. He's sort of out of shape.
Yes. That's what we thought.
White Team's really got a busy one tonight, huh, Charlie?
Say again, Mike. Over.
Say the old White Team's really got a busy one tonight, huh?
Oh, boy. We're really booming along here with all this activity. Can barely believe it.
What are you doing? Sitting around with your feet up on the console drinking coffee?
(Laughter) You must have your X ray eyes up. You sure can see a long way.
Yes. We're watching you as well, you know.
All right.
Two people in the viewing room and that's more than is in the trench.
We've got eight in the viewing room, and let's see, about six in the trench right now. And this is the highlight of the day; Buzz's exercise for the surgeon.
11, you copy? Over.
Roger. 11.
Roger. Neil has the highest heartbeat ever seen on a manned space flight, and we just went low bit rate. The surgeon is about to die. (Laughter)
I measured it up here. It came out to be 247.
Boy, that's super.
The unit's on that furlong per fortnight.
Roger. We copy that. EECOMM says if you keep that up, you're going to have to change your CO<sub>2</sub> canister.
You were going to make me do that in another 45 minutes anyway.
That's true.
That's the highlight of my day. I'm really looking forward to that.
(Music: "Music Out of the Moon")
Thank you, 11. We appreciate you turning that off. (Laughter)
Charlie, could you copy our music down there?
Did we copy what, Neil?
Did you copy our music down there?
Roger. We sure did. We're wondering who selected - made your selections?
That's an old favorite of mine, about - It's an album made about 20 years ago, called "Music Out of the Moon."
Roger. It sounded a little scratchy to us, Neil. Either that or your tape was a little slow.
It's supposed to sound that way.
That's one of those - -
- - it sounds a little scratchy to us too, but the czar likes it.
That's what we figured. He and his 40,000 votes.
For your info, we got you - It looks like about 150,000 out now.
...
It's getting appreciably larger now. It's looking more like the world.
Roger. I'm looking at the right side of the screen this time.
How's everything going on the - Say again, Charlie?
Oh, just - I -I'll never hear the last of that one about that Earth/Moon business during the TV there, and I was just saying that I was looking at the right side of the board here, so you are going towards the Earth. What are - What were you going to say, Mike?
You'll have - You'll have fun at the press conference after this shift then, won't you?
It's 2:30. Everybody will be asleep. I going to sneak off through the back way.
Okay. I was just wondering how everything is going at the home front. All the wives and kids in one piece?
Roger. Sure are. Everything's doing fine. All the gals are having a little party tonight, as far as I know.
Oh, good. Glad to hear it.
Apollo 11, Houston. I was just reading some of the transcripts of earlier today about this earlier PTC that we attempted, and when you keyed into VERB 24 and did the two ENTER's, it took off on you. I think we got a story on that, if you'd like to listen to why it had such a high rate, Mike. Over.
Yes. I'm all ears.
Okay. I think it would be better if you got your checklist out on 97, and we could walk you through it, and that way I could probably get the story straight. Over.
Okay. I got it.
Okay. Mike, what happened is - you know, you were sitting there monitoring VERB 16, NOUN 20, and at step 7 you went into VERB 24, NOUN 01, and keyed in the address and then INFORMATION INFORMATION; and on the final ENTER of that 35400 ENTER, right after that, it - that then put you back into the 16, NOUN 20. Then when you did the VERB 24, ENTER, you were really entering the information in the actual CDU; and when you got the two entries in, in register 1 and 2, it was an - it was an instantaneous change in the actual CDU, and the CM DAP looked at that and saw - saw what it thought it had. My - my gosh, I got a 600 degree per second rate. And it turns on the jets to try to take that rate out. And the rate filters that it's looking at - it - well, the rate it's looking at is filtered, so it doesn't really sense the actual rate until the thing is already built up, and then it starts reading the rate filters, and it says, "Well, I really didn't have 600 degrees." So then it turns it off and tries to slow it down. But until that happens, and it is some time lag, and that's why the rate was building up. The jets were on, and they were going to stay on due to that instantaneous 600 - suspected 600 degree per second rate. Over.
Okay. I got you.
Roger.
Man.
Hey, Charlie, are you saying that for a short period of time, he actually loaded NOUN 20 with some value other than was being read by the CDU?
I think I got that, Buzz. That's affirmative. But when he did that second VERB 24, you were - the NOUN was 20, so when he did the 3175 and then a 002 ENTER, what he actually did there was load the first two actual CDU locations, and the computer looked at it - the DAP looked at it as an instantaneous change in the actual CDU. Stand by on your comments. We're switching antennas.
Roger.
- - We're very scratchy.
Okay.
11, Houston. We got you back now on the high gain. Did you copy all that, Buzz? Over.
Yes. I think so. I - I thought maybe that NOUN 20 was one of those that you could never load from the DSKY, and that still maybe. Maybe it was loaded just for the short period of time, and then when the counters read the - the gimbal angles, why they changed it back to what they actually are. But in the meantime, the DAP saw this different number. Is that right?
Well, our guidance guy was telling me that you can actually load those ACDU's, the actual CDU's, but we'll - we're checking on that. Over.
Okay.
11, Houston. Buzz, the word from the back room is that you can actually load the NOUN 20, but you should not.
Yes. I got that. Thank you.
You're welcome.
Apollo 11, Houston. We got a recommendation for you on your stowage of the EVVA's. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like - the SPAN guys say it looks - they think that one would go on the helmet that you're going to have in B1, and you could put the other one on Mike's helmet, which will be in the sleep restraint. Over.
I doubt if it will fit on the helmet in B1. The other one might - might go in the sleep restraint. We've got them in our helmet bags, and I guess we're going to have to keep the helmets in the helmet bags, and the LEVVA's in the LEVVA bags.
Roger.
Yes. I've been thinking maybe they ought to stay sealed up.
Okay. We - -
It won't hack B1, Charlie, with the cover. I tried it already.
Okay. Fine. We weren't sure of that. It was just a suggestion. We thought we'd - You check it out. Sounds like you've already done that, so I guess whatever you can come up with, just let us know.
Okay. There's no problem. We'll let you know where they end up.
Roger.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11. Over.
Okay. Crew status report. Radiation: CDR 11020, CMP 10022, LMP 09024. No medication.
Roger. Copy.
And, Neil, we got - we'd like your onboard readouts of batteries and RCS. Over.
Okay.
Okay, Charlie. Ready to copy?
Roger. Go ahead. Over.
Okay. BATT C, PYRO BATT A, and PYRO BATT B are 37.0. RCS A, 51; B, 63; C, 63; D, 59. Go.
Roger. Copy all that, Neil. And we got an entry PAD if you're ready to copy. Over.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ready to copy. Over.
Roger, Buzz. It's an entry PAD, MPL, starting with roll 05, 35 - correction - 359 152 001. GET 194 46 03 267, plus 1102, minus 17203, 068, NOUN 60, 36194 656 11894 36275 195 03 03 0027, NOUN 69, all four lines are NA. Picking up with D zero: 400 02 09. RET of blackout, 00 17 03 38 08 20. Sextant star, 02 0945 149. Boresight star is Scorpii theta, that's Scorpii theta. Up 315, right 35, lift vector up. And the comments: This entry PAD assumes no midcourse 6. And for your information, looking at it right now, based on all the tracking we got, that maneuver would only be a tenth of a foot per second. So, we'll probably skip it. We'll let you know more about that later. Okay. Your horizon check at EI minus 30 minutes, GET of 194 33 03, gives you a pitch angle of 298. Okay. The GDC, your backup align - Your set stars for the entry REFSMMAT are Deneb and Vega, 079 234 340. Standing by for your readback. Over.
Roger. Lunar entry, MPL: 359 152 001 194 46 03 267, plus 1102, minus 17203 068 36194 656 11894 36275; 195 03 03 0027, four NA, 400 02 09 00 17 03 38 08 20 02 0945 149, Scorpii theta. Up 315, right 35, up. Assumes no MCC 6. Horizon at EI minus 30 194 33 03, and pitch 298. Set stars Deneb and Vega, 079 234 340. Over.
Roger. Very good readback, Buzz, and for your communication setup for tonight's sleep, we'd like OMNI to OMNI. Stand by.
Apollo 11, Houston. If you didn't copy that, Buzz, it was a good readback on the PAD. We've got a clock update for you that we'll have to you as soon as we can get it out to the site. We're in the process of handing over to Honeysuckle, and it will be a couple of minutes. Over.
Okay. You want the computer to BLOCK?
We'll call you. You can stay BLOCK right now. We'll give you a call.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Would you please give us P00 and ACCEPT? We've got a clock update for you.
Go ahead, Charlie. We're P00 and ACCEPT.
Roger.
11, HOUSTON. We've got the load in. You can go back to BLOCK. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
And 11, Houston. One final thing. We'd like you to select your OMNI to OMNI, OMNI A to Bravo, high gain track to MANUAL, and beam WIDE. Your angles are 270 in yaw, pitch minus 50. Over.
Roger. Fifty and minus 70.
The angles, Buzz, were yaw 270, pitch minus 50. Over.
Okay. Yaw 270, pitch minus 50.
That's Roger.
And Apollo 11, it's good night from a sleepy White Team. Over.
Roger. Thank you very much. We're not as sleepy tonight as we were last night.
Yes. I guess you guys were pretty tired last night after that busy day.
That's affirmative. I couldn't even find the chlorine.
(Laughing) Yes.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Sorry to bother you, but we'd like to have you do a VERB 34 to get the NOUN 65 off of there. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Are you up and at them yet? Over.
Well, we're up, at least, Owen.
Eyeballing my Magellanic clouds. Over.
11, Houston. Got your signals loud and clear, here. How are things this morning? Over.
Do you read us, Owen?
Roger. Loud and clear, 11.
Okay. Everything *** to be all right here. So far, we haven't been looking in the cockpit yet. We've been spending our time looking outside the cockpit. ***
Roger, 11. You're breaking up just a little bit there, Neil. Your signals are loud but are breaking up occasionally. Your spacecraft all looks good here from the ground. We noticed you stirring around the cockpit and thought we'd give you a call. Over.
Good morning.
11, Houston. We do have a few items for you here, entry PAD's, consumables, and so forth. After you've had a chance to get organized, whenever you're ready to start on a few of these items, why, we'll read them up to you. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
Go ahead, Owen. I've got the book now. I'm ready to copy.
Okay, Buzz. On your flight plan items, a few updates first of all. We've cancelled midcourse number 6. Just remain - remain in PTC. I'll give you a little more time this morning. Second item on the flight plan is we're ready for a BATT B charge anytime you want to put it on the line; and third item, we'd like a waste water dump a little differently this time. We'd like to do it on our marks from the ground. The PTC is a little bit ragged, and we would like to make the water dump at a time which we think will hold it in its proper configuration, so it looks like we'll have a desirable opportunity coming along in - between 15 and 20 minutes. And on our mark, we would like to have a waste-water dump down to about 40 percent. I'll give you a more accurate level for the water dump a little later. Over.
Roger. You must have stayed up all night figuring this one out.
11, Houston. Stand by just a moment here until we get out of the NO position on the antenna.
11, Houston. We're over on OMNI Delta now. I think we can read you better. Did you get all those first three items on your flight plan update? Over.
I got midcourse correction cancelled; battery B charge and water dump on your call. Over.
That's right, Buzz; and the last item here, we do request that we do a P52, even though we're not doing midcourse correction; and we suggest you get to that after the waste water dump has been complete. We also have a state vector update for you, if you can give us P00 and ACCEPT. Over.
Okay. You have the DSKY now.
Roger. We'll be sending that up, and I'll give you your consumables update now. It's - for a time of 170 hours, your RCS total is minus 3.5 percent, Alfa is minus 14.5, Bravo plus 7, Charlie minus 4.5, Delta minus 3; hydrogen total is minus 1, and your oxygen total is plus 24. Over.
Roger. Copy those. And onboard readouts, D is 69, C is 73, D is - Let me start over again. Okay. A is 51 and B is 62; C is 63 and D is 59. Over.
Roger, 11. Copy those, and we've checked them here on the ground, also. One correction to my last transmission. We would like that P52 prior to the waste water dump, which is coming up in about 30 minutes from now. Will that be possible? Over.
Oh, yes. We'll take care of that.
Roger. And if you're ready for an entry PAD, I'll read that up to you now, also, 11.
Ready to copy.
Okay. Entry PAD is area MIDPAC: 359 153 001 194 46 03 267, plus 1102, minus 17203 067 36194 655 11875 36275 195 03 03 00 28; DL and VL, all four are not applicable; DO, 4 00 02 10 00 18 03 38 08 21 44 2932 380; boresight star is Scorpio Theta, up 314, right 34, lift vector up. Comments: Entry data assumes no midcourse maneuvers. Your earth entry: minus 30 minutes; horizon check, 194 plus 33 plus 03. Your pitch is 297. This assumes an entry REFSMMAT. Your GDC align stars are Deneb and Vega. Roll, pitch, yaw, 078, 233, 340. Read back. Over.
Roger. MIDPAC entry PAD: 359 153 001 194 46 03 267, plus 1102, minus 17203 067 36194 655 11875 36275 195 03 03 0028, DL and VL NA, 4 00 02 10 00 18 03 38 08 21 44 2932 380, Scorpii Delta - Scorpii Theta, up 314, right 34, up. No midcourse correction, horizon, TI minus 30, 194 33 03, pitch 297, Deneb and Vega, 078, 233, 340. Over.
11, Houston. That's Roger. Copy. 11, it's also your computer. You can go back to BLOCK.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. The crew status report is 8 1/2, 7, and 8.
11, Houston. Roger, Neil. 8 1/2, 7, and 8 for your crew status.
Right.
11, Houston. Your P52 looks good here on the ground, and we are now estimating that water dump will occur along about 171 plus 40; and we'd like for you to dump to 45 percent. This should let you arrive at Earth interface with just about a full load of waste water. Over.
Understand 171 40, approximately, 40 percent.
11, Houston. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump to about 171 plus 30 just after we reacquire on the next OMNI, and - as I mentioned, it'll be down to 45 percent - is the new quantity. Also, we're standing by for your CM RCS ejector temperature readout. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. I'm not certain you copied my last transmission, as we were just in the process of switching OMNI's. We'd like to advance the time on that water dump until about 5 minutes from now. And we'll give you a precise mark on the time to start the dump, and we are standing by for a readout on your CM RCS ejector temperatures. Over.
Okay, Owen. We're standing by for your mark, and stand by for the readout.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. Are you ready to copy ejector temperatures? I'll read them in volts.
That's affirmative. Go ahead, Mike.
Okay. 2 4 is reading 4.7 volts, 2 5 is reading 4.8 volts, 1 2 is reading 4.8 volts, 1 4 is reading 4.8, 1 6 4.5, and 2 1 4.8. Over.
11, Houston. Roger. Those - I got them all.
Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready for you to start your waste water dump at this time. Over.
Roger. Dumping.
Apollo 11, Houston. We show you - -
Houston, Apollo 11. We've dumped to 45 percent, and we're stopping now. Do you concur?
Roger, 11. We concur.
Apollo 11, Houston. I can read up your forecast weather for the recovery any time you'd like to hear about it. Over.
Go ahead.
11, Houston. Present forecast shows acceptable conditions in your recovery area: 2000 foot scattered, high scattered, wind from 070 degrees, 13 knots, visibility 10 miles, and sea state about 4 feet. The forecast yesterday showed a tropical storm, Claudia, some 500 to 1000 miles east of Hawaii. The - the pictures from Earth satellites taken yesterday afternoon - afternoon showed Claudia dissipating, so this appears to be even less a factor than it was before. Your recovery area is now believed to be just a little ways north of the intertropical convergence zone, which you can probably see when you look out your windows there. Yesterday there was also a report of a tropical storm, Viola, further to the west. Its present location is some thousand miles east of the Phillipines and moving northwest. Tropical storm Viola has been intensifying, and should be transferred to the typhoon category within the next 12 hours or so; however, that will be far to your west. As a matter of fact, sunrise terminator has not yet reached Viola. When it does several hours from now, you can probably distinguish it from your viewpoint quite readily. As a matter of fact it should be of interest to perhaps take some pictures. Comment on it when you get a chance to see Viola in a few hours. So that's about the present weather state and situation for your recovery area. Over.
That sounds pretty good ...
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, Houston. We'd like to try operation with the high gain array here. If you would select reacquire and your S band antenna to HIGH GAIN, your positions are pitch plus 40 and yaw 270, and then monitor for acquisition. Over.
Okay. It's in work.
11, Houston. We're just now ready to switch from OMNI Delta over to your high gain antenna. Can you confirm that you have gone to REACQ? Over.
Confirmed.
That looks real good, Mike. Looks like we picked up about 30 dB on the signal strength.
Yes. It came in quite quickly. However, I'm showing about 240 yaw and about zero on pitch, now.
Roger. About 240 and 0.
Apollo 11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. Just wanted to make sure you fellows hadn't gone back to sleep again. And I also have a little bit of late news here if you'd like to find out what's happened in the last 12 - 14 hours. Over.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okey doke. Hot off the press here: We find Juan Carlos was formally designated yesterday - Tuesday - to become General Franco's successor - as the Chief of State of Spain and eventual King. Juan Carlos will be sworn in today as his successor designate after taking an oath of loyalty to the law and the National Movement, Spain's only legal political organization. He will apparently be called the Prince of Spain.
House Ways and Means Committee also has agreed yesterday to tax changes affecting oil companies, also banks and utilities, which could add as much as 2 billion dollars per year to the federal revenue. The committee also voted tentatively to change the accounting procedures for telephone, electric, gas, and oil pipeline companies and to reduce tax benefits of mutual savings and loan institutions. So, it looks as if tax reform may be on the way.
Looking overseas, we find South Korea's first super highway, linking Seoul with the Port of Inchon, has been named the Apollo Highway to commemorate your trip. I think we mentioned last night that President Nixon has already started on his round the world trip, and today he is in San Francisco on his first stop which will take him to the U.S.S. Hornet, from which he'll watch the return of your spacecraft. He plans to visit seven nations including Rumania during this trip. He, as I think you also knew, had to miss the All Star baseball game yesterday, as it was rained out; but it is being played today.
The West Coast residents in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; Vancouver, British Columbia; and San Francisco all plan to make their areas visible to the three of you by lighting their lights between 9 pm and midnight tonight, according to the Associated Press. We do have clear weather predicted there, so you may be able to see Christmas lights, porch lights, store lights, and whatever may be turned on.
Good show.
A little closer to home here, back in Memphis, Tennessee, a young lady who is presently tipping the scales at 8 pounds, 2 ounces, was named "Module" by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Eddie Lee McGhee. "It wasn't my idea." said Mrs. McGhee, "It was my husband's." She said she had balked at the name Lunar Module McGhee, because it didn't sound too good, but apparently they have compromised on just Module. Over.
(Laughter) ...
Roger. Hear a few chuckles coming from that direction. And we do have a late report on the sports here also. The All Star game currently being played. The present score at the end of the fourth inning has the National League leading the American League by 9 to 3. So the hitters are having a good day, you can tell.
And rain clouds are over the MSC area at the moment. It began raining here just about 10 minutes ago, and last report, we were having a pretty heavy deluge. So, that's it from the news front for the afternoon here, Apollo 11. Over.
Thank you very much, Owen. I think my yard could use some water.
That's very true. I've forgotten exactly how many days it did go, Buzz, but something like 30 days without rain; and we can appreciate the rain we're getting right now.
That was Neil. This is Buzz, here. I wish we could find out when the last time my lawn was cut. Over.
That might be a little more difficult to find out. I'm not sure whether the - whether Mike is ready to admit when he last did the job, but I'll look into that for you.
Well, he'll tell you. He's got a new mower.
Roger.
Hey, ask my chinch bugs how they're doing?
Well, I'm not sure about your's. I can let you know about my own, and the report isn't very good.
11, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. Joan wasn't home right now, Buzz, but Janis reports the grass is getting pretty high, and I would estimate that it's going to be close to your knees by the time you get out of quarantine. Over.
Okay. I'll have to schedule a little discussion after I get back.
Roger. And no reports - no report from the chinch bugs there, Mike.
Well, they're sort of taciturn little fellows. They don't say much; they just chomp away.
Concur on that.
Which is about what we're doing up here.
We concur on that, too.
Breakfast was magnificent as usual. I had sliced peaches, sausage patties, two cups of coffee, and I forget all what else.
That does sound pretty good. As a matter of fact, I'm way overdue for a meal myself, here. I could use some of that.
Why don't you get Milt to give you 5 minutes off and grab a hamburger?
I suggested that awhile ago. He was pointing out about the weight problem here. We've got to keep the calories low, so I'd better stand by without it.
Houston, Apollo 11. We've been doing a little flight planning for Apollo 12 up here.
Roger. Go ahead.
We're trying to calculate how much spaghetti and meatballs we can get on board for Al Bean.
I'm not sure the spacecraft will take that much extra weight. Have you made any estimates?
It'll be close.
11, Houston. The medics at the next console report that the shrew is one animal which can eat six times its own body weight every 24 hours. This may be a satisfactory base line for your spaghetti calculations on Al Bean. Over.
Okay. Thank you. That's in work.
Houston, Apollo 11. It was slightly colder in here last night than it has been on any previous night. Does EECOMM notice any change in his data or any explanation for that?
Roger. Stand by just a moment. We've got to check some temperatures.
Up until last night it was - if anything, a little on the warm side at night. Last night it was on the chilly side.
Roger there. We'll run down the temperatures for the 2 nights.
Oh, it's no big thing. Just as a matter of interest.
Roger.
And how'd you like the command module RCS temperatures?
11, Houston. They all look very good. The lowest temperature was 40 degrees, and we're taking a look at your cabin temperatures now.
We agree on the CM RCS. No heaters are going 2 to be required by a country mile.
We think that's correct.
We don't like those heaters, anyway, working off the direct coils.
Roger.
Peculiar thing, Owen, on the platform alignment is that when I really take my time and do a very slow, careful, precise job of marking. I'm getting about the same star angle difference as when I'm doing it in DTC and have to do a hurried rush job with relatively poor tracking. Star angle differences seem insensitive. It almost made me believe there's a very small bias there somewhere in the sextant.
Roger, 11. Perhaps the 3 degrees per second just isn't that much of a bother. Over.
Well, he's really trying to explain why he can't get all zeros.
I think Buzz is probably right. As a matter of fact, one time I made a mark which I thought was a little bit in error, but I thought, "Well heck. I'll go ahead and see how it works out anyway," and I got five zeros that time. And when I have thought everything was exactly precisely on, I have consistently been getting 0.01.
Roger. Apparently it pays to hurry.
I usually do.
The visibility through the telescope has been very poor. It's, I would say, even worse than the simulator is right now. It requires long periods of dark adaptation which most times are most inconvenient; so it's really a tremendous asset to keep the platform powered up at all times and to keep it tweaked within the capability of the sextant field of view.
Understand, Mike.
11, Houston. Checking your temperatures, it does look like the spacecraft may have cooled down perhaps 2 or 3 degrees in the last 24 hours, and that sounds to be consistent with your report on the comfort level there. Over.
Okay.
Is that a LM off phenomenon?
11, Houston. It looks like we'll have to think a little more about that, as to whether it's a LM off or some effect of being out of Lunar orbit. We don't know, so we'll have to puzzle before we can give a better answer.
Okay.
Well, if the systems guys have anything they want chased down, we'll be happy to give you any readings or reports or what have you.
Roger. We'll think about that and see if there aren't some other tests to be usefully performed here.
Okay.
11, Houston. I'll be turning things over to the Green CAP COMM at this time, and see you on the ground tomorrow.
Okay, Owen. I want to thank you and the whole Purple/Maroon group there for a good job helping Apollo 11.
Thank you, sir.
Thanks from us to all of you. It was really appreciated.
Great job, you guys.
Roger, out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
11, this is Houston. With reference to your subjective evaluation that it felt cooler in side the spacecraft last night, we reported earlier that we did indeed see a drop of about 3 degrees over the previous night. Looking back, it appears the crew of Apollo 10 reported similar feelings during the translunar and transearth coast phases. We're wondering if you could give us any indication of the relative amounts of free or condensed water in the cabin last night and the night before from which we could infer humidity. Over.
Roger. That might be a little bit difficult to do. We'll take a look at the tunnel now. It does seem as though, between the dirt, we had a little bit more moisture in the tunnel. Of course, the LM hadn't been vented when we did translunar.
Roger. We were more curious about the relative amount of moisture between, say, last night and the night before, both of which would have the LM missing.
There's more moisture in the tunnel now than there has been at any previous time. Subjectively we have been unable to determine any change in - any buildup in humidity. There appears to be no moisture any other place in the spacecraft. For example, the windows are not fogging or - and various other cool spots around the spacecraft - all of them appear to be completely dry.
This is Houston. Roger. Thank you.
How are all the "Greens" today, Bruce?
Oh, the Greens are in good shape. The actual Green Team has been here for several hours. We're dogging the watch down here to position Ron for entry. Over.
Roger. Understand. Did Dave Reed get to explain the lunar ... at the press conference?
No, but your comments about Bill Shaffer and the explanations were quoted in the paper last night.
Oh, oh.
Do you want to say anything more while you're on the line?
He's right. He's absolutely right.
How's old White, Bruce? Did he ever let you go get a cup of coffee when we were over on the back side?
Oh, things have been going pretty smoothly down here. He's really not that hard to get along with.
Oh, he must be mellowing.
We've only got two of them back here right now.
He always used to make me sit at the console through the back side passes, just for training.
Well, the word we have here is - that was because whenever you came back, you had to be retrained.
Touché.
Houston, Apollo 11. Out of curiosity, on those 70 mm cameras, we figure we exposed around 300 in the LM and around a thousand in the command module; and both cameras - or all the 70 mm cameras worked just fine.
Okay. Very good. Thank you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, this is Houston. Do you all have "Change Lima" for your entry operations checklist dated July 23? Over.
Dated when?
July 23.
I'm not sure that we hung around long enough to pick that one up.
Okay. If you've got the entry operations checklist handy, then I'll pass it up to you. Over.
How can you make changes after lift off?
You sure you don't mean June?
Negative. It just came up today. Over.
So, you're the first to get to us. Go ahead.
Okay. On page 6 1 of the entry out checklist down toward the bottom after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton," we have three additional steps we'd like you to accomplish. The intent of this is to reduce the oxygen pressure in your manifold and to eliminate the oxygen bleed flow through the potable and waste water tanks during descent. Over.
Okay. We've got 6 1 out. Go ahead.
Okay. Down at the bottom, you've got "10,000 feet MAIN PARACHUTE DEPLOY, MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH within 1 second." And after that step, we'd like you insert "SURGE TANK O<sub>2</sub> valve, OFF; REPRESS PACKAGE valve, OFF; and DIRECT O<sub>2</sub> valve, OPEN." Do you copy?
Okay. Down at the bottom, after "MAIN DEPLOY pushbutton, PUSH; SURGE TANK O<sub>2</sub>, OFF; and REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE, OFF, DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>, ON" Over.
Roger. And then down at the very bottom of page 6 2 where you see "DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>, OFF VERIFY," delete that step completely. Over.
Roger.
And for record purposes, this will be "Change Lima." Over.
Okay. We've got it. How far open do you want this the DIRECT O<sub>2</sub> valve to be opened at this point? I guess you want it - just leave it open from that point on?
Roger. It should go all the way open, and you can just leave it on from that point on. The intent is to completely depressurize the oxygen manifold. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. For your information the All Star game has just ended with the National League winning 9 to 3 over American. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
And I have a message here for Mike that says "All the chinch bugs are gone." Over.
Having done their job I guess.
Well, along with one tree, it turns out.
Yes. I heard about that. That was right before the flight.
Right. That big storm.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Are you still up there? Over.
Yes, we are. But not quite so far as we were a while ago.
Roger. We concur. We just wanted to make sure that we had good COMM with you.
Okay.
For general information, 11, you are now 95,970 miles out from the Earth. Over.
Right in our own back yard.
Say again.
Right in our own back yard.
Roger that.
Trying to come down hill a little bit now. What's our velocity?
Your velocity is 5991 feet per second.
Thank you.
And you are indeed coming down hill.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, 11. I've got a flight plan update for you to give you an optimum attitude for the Earth in the number 1 window and the Moon in number 5 window. Over.
Ready to copy.
Roger. Your attitude will be roll 12 degrees, pitch 270 degrees, yaw 0 degrees. High gain antenna angles, pitch plus 14, yaw 263. Over.
Roger. I copy. Roll 012, pitch 270, yaw 0. High gain antenna, pitch plus 14 and yaw 263.
Roger. And when coming out of PTC, you might be advised that your deadband has been collapsed, so follow the checklist items. Over.
Roger that.
11, this is Houston. We're receiving a black signal from you right now, but we are getting TV. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
From signal strength indications, it appears that we may be locked up on a side lobe with a high gain antenna. We'd like you to go into wide bandwidth for about 15 seconds and then back to narrow. Over.
All right.
You have good S band signal strength now, Houston?
That's affirmative, 11.
You all set for TV?
Roger. We're all set whenever you're ready to send.
Okay.
Okay. You're coming through loud and clear now, 11, with your patch.
Good evening. This is the Commander of Apollo 11. A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the Moon. His spaceship, Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip to the Moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of the crew as the modern day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth and the same Pacific Ocean tomorrow. First, Mike Collins.
11, this is Houston. We have an LOS here.
We'll be right back with you.
Roger.
In the interim, you may be interested in knowing that Jan and the children and Pat and the youngsters and Andy Aldrin are down here in the viewing room watching this evening.
We're glad to hear that.
Okay, 11. You're back on, with Mike in the middle of the screen there.
Roger. This trip of ours to the Moon may have looked, to you, simple or easy. I'd like to assure you that has not been the case. The Saturn V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary, each word of which has been very carefully chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the crew. This switch which I have in my hand now, has over 300 counterparts in the command module alone, this one single switch design. In addition to that, there are myriads of circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large rocket engine on the aft end of our service module, must have performed flawlessly, or we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the ocean. We have always had confidence that all this equipment will work, and work properly, and we continue to have confidence that it will do so for the remainder of the flight. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people. First, the American workmen who put these pieces of machinery together in the factory. Second, the painstaking work done by the various test teams during the assembly and retest after assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned Spacecraft Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last, but not least, in crew training. This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine. All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all those, I would like to say, thank you very much.
11, this is Houston. We're getting a good picture of Buzz now, but no voice modulation. And would you open up the f stop on the TV camera; try 22, please?
That appears to be a lot better now. We're still not receiving Buzz's audio.
Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. As we've been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than three men on a voyage to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day upon first setting foot on the surface of the Moon, "This is a small step for a man, but a great leap for mankind," I believe sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the Moon; the acceptance of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission, I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously chose for our spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our flight, depicting the U.S. eagle bringing the universal symbol of peace from the Earth, from the planet Earth to the Moon; that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the Moon. Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me. "When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained, what is man that Thou art mindful of him."
The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have through their will, indicated their desire; next, to four administrations, and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, to the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the space suit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft, who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their - their hearts and all their abilities into those crafts. To those people, tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.
11, this is Houston. We're getting a zoom view out the window now.
Apollo 11, signing off.
Houston, Apollo 11. Do you want to crank up PTC again; do you have some reason to hold its attitude, or what's your pleasure?
You can crank up PTC again, Mike, any time you like. And I might add I thought that was a mighty fine TV presentation. There's certainly nothing I can add to it from down here.
Thank you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, 11. I've got a few small items here: one flight plan update and some entry photography information, if you are ready to copy. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. At 180 hours 50 minutes GET, we should like to delete your oxygen fuel cell purge.
Okay.
And on the entry photography, if you are going to use a fresh magazine of color interior film, we recommend the following exposure settings: f11 at 1/250, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.0, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the chutes open. If you are using a magazine, part of which has already been used for interior shots, we recommend f16 at 1/500 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 7 feet for the fireball; f2.8, 1/60 of a second, six frames per second, focus on 50 feet when the parachutes open. And we would like to know the magazine number that you are intending to use if you have a chance. Over.
Okay. I think we got those. We will be using a fresh one and it will be color interior. Over.
Roger. When you get - get it out, we would like to have the number of the magazine and the letter of the magazine relayed down.
Okay. And we're thinking that we might want to run some of that at 12 frames per second. And I think we can get everything from 0.5 - 0.5g down; that will only give us about 7.8 minutes and ... frames ... double that. I guess maybe just an occasional burst to 12 frames would be what we want and the rest of it at six. Over.
This is Houston. That plan sounds fine with us, Neil.
Okay.
And lastly, we would like to know if your stowage configuration for entry is going to conform to the nominal. The RETRO's down here are anxious to get an accurate e.g. computed for you, and in particular, where the LEVVA's are being stowed. Over.
Okay. We think we are going to put the LEVVA's and helmets in the hatch bag, and we'll let you know any other nonstandard stowage locations that we complete this evening.
This is Houston. Roger. Out.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Go ahead, 11.
Roger. The magazine we'll be using for entry tomorrow is magazine M. Over.
Roger. Understand. Magazine M as in Mike.
That's right.
Thank you. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Your friendly Green Team going off for the night, and going off for the last time. We wish to bid you a good night and Godspeed.
Thank you. We appreciate all that fine work done by the Green Team, and we'll be thanking you in person when we get back.
Roger. We'll see you on the ground.
Really enjoyed working with all of you. Thanks very much. Over.
Roger.
As usual, all you Greenies.
They're all smiles down here, even the trench.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. How's our thruster firing activity? We're about ready to crank up PTC if you are.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
11, we'd like you to shift to an OMNI antenna configuration at the present time. We're requesting the S band antenna OMNI switch to Bravo and the S band antenna OMNI switch to OMNI. The high gain antenna track in MANUAL. Pitch minus 50, yaw 270. Over.
Roger. I'll do that right now.
Roger. And if Mike has a minute, we'd like to do a little bit of troubleshooting. It seems he's either flat chested or something because we've lost respiration rate on the BIOMED telemetry. That is, the ZPN trace down here is flat.
He was shaving a little bit ago. He might have just let it slip. Hold on a moment.
All the blasted wires are all connected, is all I know.
Okay, Mike. We had a request that you disconnect the yellow connector from the signal conditioner and verify that it looks okay, reconnect it and then, if you would, check the two electrodes that are placed one on each side of your lower rib cage. Over.
I bet you there's a smile on Charlesworth's face.
Cliff is not on right now. Gene Kranz just relieved him a few minutes ago.
Roger that.
All those wires and things look normal up here.
Roger, Mike. We could see variations on our traces. You've connected and disconnected, but the medics still don't have a signal.
Looks like you're sending us a message of some sort.
Well, I promise to let you know if I stop breathing.
Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston broadcasting in the blind. Request OMNI Bravo. Request OMNI Bravo. Over.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Communication reestablished.
...
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Will you confirm you're in OMNI Bravo? Over.
Okay. That ought to give it to you.
Roger. Out.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Mike, we're still getting a flat trace on you for the impedance pneumograph. Before you turn in this evening, you might try putting some fresh paste in the sensors, and if that doesn't work, the medics have agreed to forget about it. Over.
Mike's off the loop right now. I'll convey that message.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 11. Say again.
Roger, Mike. The trace on your respiration rate is still flat. If you have time this evening before turning in, we would suggest that you try putting some fresh paste in the two electrodes that go on the side of your lower rib cage; and if that doesn't work, just give up on it.
...
(Sound of Train)
Hey, 11, this is Houston. You might tell Buzz not to exercise quite so strenuously. Over.
What's the problem?
Say again.
What's the problem?
Okay. That's one - that's one on us. (Laughter)
11, Houston. Seriously, that comment was just aimed at your musical selection.
Okay.
(Sound of train)
Come on Neil, not so fast.
(Sound of train)
You have an ergometer up here.
What was that? Real time exercise?
Just trying to be your ergometer.
Roger.
Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
We'd like to know what your plans are as far as turning in this evening. Our - in the flight plan we show you commencing a rest period at about 182 hours, and what are you planning to do on that? We're going to be watching the weather here, and we expect to have an update on the weather, I guess, in about half hour or 45 minutes to pass to you. Over.
We're going to probably stick with the flight plan pretty much. We are going to - if - check the lights in the northwest corner of the U.S. and southwest corner of Canada. If we can see up that high into the northern hemisphere. Other than that, we'll be on the flight plan.
Roger. For your information, the laser from McDonald Observatory in West Texas will be up from about 181 hours and 30 minutes, on for 1 hour. You should be able to spot the earth out of the number 1 window every time you pass roll 357 degrees and then, of course, you're in West Texas. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
How about the number 5 window?
Stand by a minute.
Roger. For the number 5 window. That'll be - every time you pass 230 degrees in roll. Over.
Beautiful. Thank you.
You guys are on your toes down there.
Roger. - -
You have a new, new star chart. You must have a new, new star chart. Huh?
Oh, we got a fresh, fresh FAO here.
Houston, Apollo 11. How much longer do you want us to keep charging battery B?
11, this is Houston. Nominally we're looking for about another hour and a half, but what we'd like to do is continue charging until shortly before you turn in for the night. Over.
That'll be fine. Are you going to want to charge A again at all?
Negative, 11.
Okay.
11, this is Houston. At about 180 45, we'll be handing over from Goldstone to Honeysuckle, and I'm handing over to Charlie. See you when you get back. Over.
Okay, Bruce. Good night. Thank you.
Roger. Good night.
Thank you very much, Bruce. It's been a pleasure working with you.
Have a nice trip down.
Houston, Apollo 11. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Houston. For RETRO, I have the anticipated location of all the entry stowage, and I suggest you pull out the entry checklist, and we'll go through those maps in the front of it.
Apollo 11, Houston. Could you stand by just a few minutes? Charlie and Flight are out getting a weather briefing. They'll be back shortly.
Is this Ken?
Say again?
Is this Owen?
No, this is Chuck Lewis. Charlie Duke is out with Flight getting a weather briefing right now.
Okay. They're out drinking coffee. I know.
(Laughter) They'll be back momentarily.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. Over.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11. Did you get the word on the entry checklist?
Roger, Mike. We sure did. We're ready to talk about it, if you are. Over.
I think the quickest thing is to go through page by page, the first part of the entry checklist where it has a map. Starting on the page with compartment L2 and L3. Are you with me?
Roger. With you.
Okay. L2 is as shown. L3 is as shown; there is about half the food remaining in L3.
Roger.
Where it says - where it says "And note," the CMP PGA is located in the L shaped bag with the other two PGA's. The LM shield was jettisoned with the - Correction, the CMP's helmet shield was jettisoned with the LM, and his helmet and gloves, instead of being in the sleep restraint, are in the hatch bags.
Okay. Let's see now. Your PGA is in the L shaped bag with the other two PGA's, and your helmet and gloves are in the L shaped bag instead of the sleep restraint.
The helmet and gloves are in the hatch bag, the great big bag that's underneath the left hand couch that you put the hatch in.
Roger. I thought I - That's what I copied. Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. The next page is identical except a nitpicking point: out R1 we got the entry checklist. Other than that it is identical, and the third page has got some changes.
Go ahead.
In A1 - Are you with me? I'm over there in compartment A1, now.
Go ahead, Mike. Over.
In compartment A1, the 16 millimeter magazine will be located in window number 4 instead of 5. Tissue dispensers; there is only one of them left. And compartment U3, the 16 millimeter bracket is on window 4, and the PGA bag - add the CMP's PGA, plus add two LCG's. And compartment A8 delete two LCG's, add one PPK, making a total of four, and add 10 pounds of LM miscellaneous equipment. We told you five the other day. We think ten is probably closer. Over.
Copy.
And that's all the changes on that page. Ready for the next page?
Roger. Go ahead, Mike.
On your next page, in compartment B1, we estimate about 15 percent of that food is remaining. In B2 we took PPK out of there and put trash in it. In B3, the 16 millimeter cable, the 18 millimeter lens, and the right angle mirror are on window number 4. And that there brings you all up to date.
Roger. How about the LEVVA's, Mike? Where did you put those? Over.
They're in the hatch bag.
Roger. Stand by. Our only concern, 11, is with the stuff you got in the hatch bag. That's pretty big bulk between you and A8, and we'd like to talk about moving that over to the sleep restraint. If you will stand by. I'll verify that. Over.
Okay.
11, Houston. Our recommendation on the gear you got in the helmet bag - correction, hatch bag, would be to remove that stuff and put it in the sleep restraint under the right couch. The reason is that the hatch bag straps are only configured for zero g, and it is a pretty difficult job getting it lashed down. With the gear in the sleep restraint, it's a pretty standard lash down procedure, and you could also use the Beta cord that you have on hoard. You concur? Over.
Yes. We'll look at it, Charlie, and let you know.
Roger. And I got a couple of other things, Mike. We need to terminate battery B charge at this time, and also, the weather is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattered thunderstorms. We don't want to tangle with one of those, so we are going to move the - your aim point uprange. Correction, it will be downrange, to target for 1500 nautical mile entry so we can guarantee uplift control. The new coordinates are 13 degrees, 19 minutes north, 169 10 minutes west. The weather in that area is super. We got 2000 scattered, 8000 scattered with 10 miles visibility and 6 foot seas and the Hornet is sitting in great position to get to that targeted position. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Some of the general last minute updates here. On the entry, we had told you on the camera to set it at 50 feet. It turns out the biggest number on the camera is 25 feet, so just set it at infinity. Over.
Roger. Infinity.
Hello, Apollo 11. Houston. We're ready to put you to bed and say good night, if you give us your crew status report and verify that you changed out the CO<sub>2</sub> canister a moment ago. Over.
Stand by.
Okay, Charlie. Crew status report follows: CDR 11023, CMP 10025, LMP 09027. Canister change complete.
Roger. Thank you very much there.
All men okay.
Roger. Thank you. Could you give us an onboard readout, please, sir?
Stand by. Okay. BAT C 37, PYRO BAT A 37, BAT B 37, RCS A 51, B 63, C 62, D 58.
Roger. Copy. Thank you much.
Apollo 11, Houston. It's good night from the White Team for the last time. We'll be off when you wake up in the morning. It's been a pleasure working with you guys. It was a beautiful show from all three of you. We appreciate it very much, and we'll see you when you get out of the LRL. Over.
Okay, Charlie. Thanks to you and all the White Team for a great job down there all the way through. Thank you.
Outstanding.
... very much, Charlie. Thanks.
Thanks to you guys, too.
And, 11, Houston. Mike, you get your chance at landing tomorrow. No go around.
Roger. You're going to let me land closer to Hawaii, too, aren't you?
That's right, sir.
11, Houston. We got some word just a moment ago that the McDonald Observatory is - said they had picked up the spacecraft in their telescope. Over.
Outstanding. We have been looking for their laser but haven't had much luck yet.
Roger. We'll pass it on to them, Neil. Thank you.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. Go.
Roger. Good morning. What's the status on midcourse 7?
Roger. We were going to let you sleep in until about 190 hours. Midcourse 7 is not required.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 11. Good morning from Houston. Over.
Good morning, 11.
Roger. We saw you up stirring around, and we thought that you were probably eating your breakfast there. Just in general, we'll probably start coming up with the uplink of the state vectors and the target loads and what have you at about 190 50, somewhere in that area, and get you started to work.
Okay.
And in the meantime, while you're eating your breakfast there, I've got the Maroon Bugle all standing by here to give you the morning news.
Glad to hear it.
Okay. Apollo 11 remains the prime story with the world awaiting your landing today at about 11 49 a.m. Houston time. In Washington, House tax reformers have fashioned a provision which would make it impossible for wealthy individuals to avoid income tax entirely through tax free investments or special allowances. Under the proposal tentatively adopted by the House Ways and Means Committee, everyone would pay taxes on at least half of their income.
Hang on a minute.
Roger. Standing by.
Okay. Okay, Ron. We're ready to go again. Thank you.
Roger. Continuing with the Maroon Bugle. President Nixon surprised your wives with a phone call from San Francisco just before he boarded a plane to fly out to meet you. All of them were very touched by your television broadcast. Jan and Pat watched from Mission Control here. The launch of Intelsat from the Cape was postponed for the fourth time last night. The problem was said to be a malfunctioning nitrogen regulator in the second stage of Delta. A new attempt will be made to launch it tonight. The research submarine Ben Franklin, which is studying the Gulf Stream, set a record by drifting 24 hours from 10 to 100 feet above the ocean floor in 1300 feet of water off the Georgia coast. The mission is led by Jacques Picard. Wally Schirra has been elected to a 5 year term on the board of trustees of the Detroit Institute of Technology. He will serve on the Institute's development committee. Air Canada says it has accepted 2300 reservations for flights to the Moon in the past 5 days. It might be noted that more than 100 have been made by men for their mothers in law. And finally, it appears that rather than killing romantic songs about the Moon, you have inspired hundreds of song writers. Nashville, Tennessee, which probably houses the largest collection of recording companies and song publishers in the country, now reports it is being flooded by Moon songs. Some will make it. The song at the top of the best sellers list this week is, "In the year 2525." Morning Bugle. Out.
Thank you very much, Ron.
Houston, crew status report: 5.5 7 5.5.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. We copy. And I have your consumables update, if you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Roger. GET 189 plus 00: RCS total minus 1 percent; Alfa minus 11; Bravo plus 10; Charlie minus 1; Delta minus 1; H<sub>2</sub> total minus 0.76 pounds; oxygen total plus 17.6 pounds. Over.
Okay. It doesn't look like we're going to be able to get quite back on the flight plan.
Not quite; just about though.
Apollo 11, Houston. Request P00 and ACCEPT, and we'll send your REFSMMAT, state vector, and entry target load. Over.
You have it.
Roger. It'll be coming up.
Apollo 11, Houston. Can you tell us where the visor assemblies ended up, there?
We're going to follow your suggestion and stow them under right hand couch.
Roger. Mighty fine. Break. The weather forecast in the landing area right now is 2000 scattered, high scattered, 10 miles. The wind about 080 at 18 knots. You'll have about 3- to 6 foot waves. Your Delta H is plus 10 feet. And it looks like you'll be landing about 10 minutes before sunrise. Over.
Okay. Sounds good.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. All three loads are in. The computer is yours. Over.
Roger.
And Mike, if you're on loop there, to extend the range and the constant g reentry, here, I've got a little procedure, if you would like to listen to it.
Stand by one.
Roger.
I'm right in the middle of my orange juice. Be with you in about 5 minutes.
Sure, no problem, standing by.
Houston, Apollo 11. Hey, Ron, I wonder if you could give us a good Navy explanation for this Delta H time. Over.
Roger. Let me think about it, and I'll come back.
You too, huh?
(Laughter) Right.
Collins has got one, but I'm not sure I buy it.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, 11. We don't have to worry about it any more. The altimeter out there is now standard, 29.92; but basically what it means is that if I give you a plus 10 feet, for instance, that means that you will hit the water with the altimeter reading 10 feet. Over.
All right.
Ah, Collins was wrong.
Apollo 11, Houston. I have your entry PAD. Over.
Stand by.
Roger. Standing by.
Okay, I'm ready to copy.
Roger. Entry PAD: area is the mid Pacific, roll 000, 152, 001, GET 194 46 06, 267, latitude plus 1332, minus 16917, 064, 36194, 649, range to go 14045, 36275, 195 03 06, 00 28, DL max 154, 084, 22400, 18000, D0 400, 02 13, 00 17, 03 51, 09 02, sextant star 45 0189, 277, boresight star, none available, lift vector up. Comments: GDC align, Vega and Deneb, roll 078, pitch 223, yaw 340. Additional comments: Use nonexit EMS pattern, EI minus 30, horizon check GET 194 33 06. Pitch 298. You'll get P65, but no P66. Additional note: Initial bank angle in P67 may not be full lift. Apollo 11, Houston. Read back.
Okay, Ron, For MIDPAC: 000, 152, 001, 194, 46 06, 267, plus 1332, minus 16917, 064, 36194, 649, 14045, 36275, 195 03 06, 0028, 154, 084, 2240, 180, 400, 02 13, 00 17, 03 51, 09 02, 45, 0189, 277, none available, lift vector up, GDC align, Vega and Deneb, roll 078, pitch 223, yaw 340. Use nonexit EMS. EI minus 30, horizon check 194 33 06, pitch 298. Initial bank angle in P67 may not be full lift, and we will get P65 but no P66.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. On your GDC align pitch, it should be 233, 233 in the pitch. Over.
Okay. I've got a 233.
Also your DL and MAX and MIN, I'm sure. are 22 400 and 18 000. Over.
Yes. That's right.
Okay. If you'll dig out your entry checklist there on page E6 1, I'll update your RETRO times there for the various altitudes. Over.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. On page E6 1, your RRT is 07 20, your 50K is 08 16; 40K is 08 30; your 24K is 09 02; and your 10K is 09 51. Over.
Okay. RRT, 07 20, 50 000, 08 16. That's - 07 20 is - is the time of steam pressure peg from RRT; and 40 000, 08 30; 24 000, 09 02; 10 000, 09 51.
11, Houston. You started out right, and then the numbers you read back were correct; but I didn't get your comment in between there.
I assume that - all I wanted to know is that first time, 07 20, that's the time of steam pressure peg. Right?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 11. Ron, I'm ready to copy your message about the constant drag level.
Okay, Mike. Of course, this is in the event the G&N and the EMS quits and you have to fly the constant g; and what we're trying to do is extend the constant g range from 1100 to 1500 miles. We've run this procedure in the simulator, and it works fine. Basically, I'll go through it - just go through it, and then if you have any questions come back. But it's the same lift vector up until MAX g, and then lift vector down, and then modulate the lift vector until g dot goes to zero. Okay. This procedure is essentially the same so far. And then hold g dot zero until you pass the RETRO elapsed time of V circular; and then after you pass this RETRO elapsed time of V circular, roll to a gimbal angle of 45 degrees, and then hold this constant bank angle of 45 degrees until you come to the RETRO elapsed time of drogues. Over.
Okay. It sounds straightforward enough. Understand constant g backup backup procedure, lift vector up until MAX g and then lift vector down; then modulate until bank angle until g dot equals zero. Maintain g dot equals zero until subcircular, then roll 45 degrees and hold until drogue time. Over.
Okay. That's mighty fine, Mike. That's correct.
This entry time line is my kind of time line. Nice and slow.
Okay, 11. Houston. Roger. It sure is. EECOMM is anxiously awaiting his big moment here for the logic sequence check whenever you're ready.
Okay. We'll be ready for that in just a flash.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead, Ron.
This is Jim, Mike. Backup crew is still standing by. I just want to remind you that the most difficult part of your mission is going to be after recovery.
Well, we're looking forward to all parts of it.
Please don't sneeze.
Keep the mice healthy.
The Earth is really getting bigger up here and, of course, we see a crescent.
Yes.
We've been taking pictures and we have four exposures to go, and we'll take those and then pack the camera.
Houston, Apollo 11. We're ready for the logic check whenever you are. We're standing by to arm the logic. We've got ELS logic on, ELS AUTO, and all the circuit breakers in.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. You can press on with the SECS logic.
Okay. Logic 1 coming on.
MARK it.
Logic 2 coming on.
MARK it.
Apollo 11, Houston. Logic checks good. You're GO for PYRO ARM.
Thank you, sir.
Houston, Apollo 11 has got VHF A Simplex on whenever you want to make a COMM check.
Apollo 11, Houston. Roger. You faded out a little bit there, Buzz. I understand you have the VHF Simplex A on now. Is that correct? Over.
That affirmative. VHF Simplex A and we're TR on VHF.
Roger. Mighty fine. We'll watch it as you are coming on in and let you know when the intelligibility is up. We'll make a voice check with you at that time.
Houston, Apollo 11. I've been holding here in SCS control MINIMUM DEADBAND RATE LOW with the limit cycle on, just as a matter of curiosity, if you guys wanted some fuel numbers from that.
11, Houston. Roger. We copy and we've been figuring it out.
Okay.
It's a pleasure to be able to waste gas.
Roger. That's affirmative.
Apollo 11, Houston with a little recovery force information. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. The Hornet is on station just far enough off the target point to keep from getting hit. Recovery 1, or the chopper, is there; they're on station. And Hawaii Rescue 1 and 2, the C 130's, are within 40 minutes of your target point. Over.
Sounds good. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Just to get a little downlink here to check out our VHF: I show us about an hour and 37 minutes, approximately, from entry interface. Over.
Okay. That's about right.
Okay. Looks like we're together on that, and I guess we're standing by for you to whip into the entry attitude.
Okay. We've just been taking a couple of last minute pictures. We've finished the EMS entry check, primary water EVAP activation.
Roger. Mighty fine.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Mike. We recommend the left VHF antenna for VHF.
And this is your friendly backup CMP. Have a good trip, and may - remember to come in BEF.
You better believe. Thank you kindly.
We can see the Moon passing by the window and it looks what I considered to be a correct size.
Houston, Apollo 11. Like to switch to S band OMNI C. I just did a minute ago, and noticed a loss of signal strength, over.
Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead and try it again now that you're in attitude.
Roger. Going OMNI C.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Apollo 11, Houston. Recommend antenna Bravo. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston. Recommend antenna Bravo, or at least a better one. Over.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead, Ron.
Roger. Faces are red here. We lost data with you there for a while. Did you do the P52? Over.
That's affirmative, we completed the P52. We'll give you the data from it in just a second. We passed our sextant star check at entry attitude, and right now we're maneuvering to our first horizon check pitch attitude of 298 degrees.
Roger. Copy that, 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. About 4 minutes to 1 hour, and I'll give you a mark at 1 hour. Was a command module preheat necessary? Over.
Negative that.
Roger. Copy. Negative command module preheat.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We don't want to jettison the hydrogen tank that stratified, so could you cycle the fans in tank 2 please? Hydrogen tank 2.
You better believe, that old service module has taken good care of us. We want to take good care of it.
It sure has, hasn't it.
It's been a champ.
11, Houston. I'll give you a time hack at 58 minutes to go. It's about 15 seconds yet.
Thank you.
Stand by.
MARK.
58 minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11.
Roger. We have our update at the state vector out there for you. Request P00 and ACCEPT. Over.
Okay. You've got it.
Okay. Here it comes.
Apollo 11, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. The computer is yours now. Looks like you're in VHF range, here. So we'll try a VHF check for you. We'll just send VHF up to you. Stand by.
Okay.
Apollo 11, Houston. VHF check on Simplex Alfa. Over.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 11, VHF Simplex Alfa, loud and clear. How me? Over.
Roger, 11. Houston. You're loud. The standard VHF noise, though, makes you realize that S band is good.
Roger. Understand. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. Backup S band now, and we're standing by for command module RCS activation.
Okay. We're just about there.
Apollo 11, Houston, you're GO for PYRO ARM.
Thank you, Houston.
Apollo 11, Houston. Your command module pressurization looks mighty fine to us.
Looks good here, Ron.
And 11, Houston, I've got an update for about four items on your entry PAD.
Ready to copy.
Roger. Your MAX g, 063; your NOUN 60, your Gamma, at 400K, 648; your range to go on the EMS, 14033; and your RETRO time for V circular, 02 14. Over.
Roger. Copy MAX g 6.3; R2 at NOUN 60, 6.48; range to go, EMS, 14033; RET V circular, 02 14. Over.
Roger. Readback is correct there.
Houston, Apollo 11.
Apollo 11, Houston. GO.
Roger. The first horizon check 194 23 06 at a pitch angle of 298 does not quite fall on the 31 7 line. It's just a little high. It's within 5 degrees tolerance.
Apollo 11, Houston. The horizon check there was supposed to be at 33. Over.
Okay. That's fine, sir. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 11, Houston. Command module RCS looks fine to us.
Same here, Ron. Looks very good. Doesn't make as much noise as we thought. Some of them are barely audible.
Roger.
And 11, Houston. Weather still holding real fine in the recovery area.
Roger.
Looks like it's about 1500 scattered, high scattered. And it's still 3  to 6 foot waves.
Hey, that part of it sounds good.
Roger.
11, Houston, I'll give you another Mark at 33 minutes. Stand by.
MARK.
Roger that.
Houston, Apollo 11. Do you have any recommended settings to catch the sunset. Over.
Roger. Well, the time is 36 41. And stand by for some settings.
Okay. I'll probably only be doing it maybe - part of it at six frames a second, some it at one. So I could be changing settings as it goes through.
Roger. Copy.
And the horizon check passes; it's right on the money.
Hey, mighty fine. Sounds good.
Apollo 11, Houston. On the shooting at the Sun, f:16th at 1 over 250.
Understand f:16 at 1 over 250.
Roger.
And the Sun is going down on schedule. It's getting real dark in here.
Apollo 11. Houston. Copy.
Apollo 11, Houston. We see you getting ready for SEP. Everything looks mighty fine down here.
Same here, Ron. Thank you.
Apollo 11, Houston. You're still looking mighty fine from here. You're cleared for landing.
We appreciate that, Ron. Thank you.
Roger. Gears down and locked.
Roger.
Thank you.
Houston, we got the service module going by. A little high and a little bit to the right.
Roger. Thank you.
And it's rotating just like it should be. Thrusters are firing.
Good. It's got a lot of gas there to burn out, too.
It's coming across now from right to left.
Houston. Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. You going to turn on the tape recorder shortly?
11, Houston. You can go ahead and turn it on.
Okay. I'll have to go to command reset to do that.
11, Houston. That's negative. All you have to do is turn it on. That'll be fine.
I guess I don't know how to turn it on, then. I got PCM, ANTILOG RECORD, FORWARD; high bit rate, and barber pole.
11, Houston. We'll send the ON command from down here, see if it works.
Okay.
Got our friend the Moon whipping by the field of view right now.
Roger. Copy.
11, Houston. We'll have you for about 3 or 4 minutes through Redstone and then pick you up after blackout through ARIA.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 11. I'm going to go to COMMAND RESET and turn the tape on.
...
11, Houston. Recommend negative on that. That will put us in low bit rate.
Okay. I already put it to COMMAND RESET, but I still have barber pole on the tape. And now my switch is high bit rate.
Okay. That will be fine. On 225, there, if you can reach it, Buzz, the last two circuit breakers in the second row from the bottom, punch those in.
And 11, Houston, don't mess around with that 225 there.
Okay.
And 11, Houston. You're going over the hill there shortly. You're looking mighty fine to us.
See you later.

GO orbit and the booster is safe. Thank you, Joe.
Don't mention it.
13, Houston. We copy your NOUN 44.
Okay, Joe.
Apollo 13, Houston. Your preliminary orbit down here is 102.5 times 100.3, and everything is looking good.
Roger, Houston. And it looks good to be up here again.
I'll bet.
13, Houston. I have your Z torquing angles. You ready?
Jack is ready to copy, Joe.
Okay. It's plus 0.26. Over.
Okay, Joe. Plus 0.26.
That's Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Couple minutes to LOS, Jim. Everything is looking real good. Your AOS time at Carnarvon will be 52:36, and we don't have too much of a handle on why the inboard cut off early except that it apparently was an engine problem and not a switch-select function. But we are certain that you'll be able to make TLI based on what we are looking at now.
Roger. There's nothing like an interesting launch.
That's right.
Apollo 13, Houston. Canary LOS in 30 seconds. Request COMMAND RESET, please.
Roger. COMMAND RESET coming on.
Thank you.
Apollo 13, Houston. Request LOW BIT RATE, please. Over.
LOW BIT RATE.
Houston, how do you read 13?
13, Houston. Loud and clear.
Okay, Joe. Everything's going good. We're proceeding on the time line in good fashion. I've got a P52 done. I can give you the torquing angles.
I'm ready for them, Jack.
Okay. Use NOUN 26; stars 26 and 33. The star angle difference was all balls. NOUN 93: minus 067, minus all balls, plus 0.162. The time of torquing was 45 minutes 35 seconds.
Well, that sounds marginally acceptable.
For a new CMP, it ain't too bad.
Yes. Okay, 13. We've got nothing for you at the moment. Everything's looking good. We're looking at your data now.
Apollo 13, Houston. LOS Carnarvon in about 30 seconds. Honeysuckle on the hour, and verify your S-band is up for Honeysuckle. Over.
That's verified.
Roger.
And, Houston, we're beginning to see a beautiful sunrise here.
Roger that, Jim.
13, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Apollo 13, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Roger, Houston; 13 here. Reading you loud and clear.
Okay. S-band sounds good, Jim.
Houston, 13.
Go ahead, 13.
Would it be okay if I crank up the FM ... ...?
You're coming in weak. I didn't quite copy it.
Would it be okay, Joe, if we crank up the FM after we leave Honeysuckle here?
Oh. Stand by on that one.
13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
What TV was that? Okay, 13 - -
Okay, Joe. I just wanted to put on the TV switch at Honeysuckle to tune her up there.
Roger. I'm being prompted, and you've got a GO for that. You can turn it on, go to TV, and we'll see you that way over the States.
Okay.
Okay. 13, Houston. LOS Honeysuckle in about 30 seconds, and we'll see you over the States at 1 plus 28 plus 43.

Hello there. We thought you were still up there.
And we're just coming up on Baja, and I've got the TV on. Do you want it?
I don't think we require it just yet, Jack, but we'll command it when we're ready. I believe they are dumping the tape now. The booster looks good. The spacecraft looks good on the few minutes' data we've had.
That sounds good.
Jim finally let me look out.
(Laughter) How do you like it?
Chained me to the LEB down there stowing things and unstowing things, and I finally got a chance to look out and see the world.
Apollo 13, Houston. I have the TLI plus 90, and lift-off plus 8 pads whenever you're ready.
Okay. Go ahead with the TLI pad, Joe.
Okay. This is the TLI plus 90 pad. SPS/G&N, 63825, minus 1.54, plus 1.32, 004:06:45.53, minus 0491.7, plus 0000.1, plus 6634.0, 180, 228, 001; HA is N/A; HP is plus 0017.9; 6652.2, 7:37, 6626.5, 26, 155.4, 15.7.

Joe, we had a dropout of signal there about midway or about a fifth of the start of your pad, and Fred didn't get it. We'd like you to start over again. Could you please?
Sure thing. You want the whole thing?
Yes, I think you'd better.
Okay. TLI plus 90: SPS/G&N, 63825, minus 1.54, plus 1.32, 004:06:45.53, minus 0491.7, plus 0000.1, plus 6634.0, 180, 228, 001; N/A; plus 0017.9, 6652.2, 7:37, 6626.5, 26, 155.4, 15.7; Zeta Sagittarius; up, 08.0; right 2.1; minus 22.81, minus 025.00, 1140.7, 34087, 013:32:14.

Okay, Joe. That's 63825, minus 1.54, plus 1.32, 004:06:45.53 - -
Fred, Houston. Stand by 1.
- - minus 0491.7, plus 0000.1, plus 6634.0.
Fred, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
That's correct. We would like you to go the S-BAND AUX TV switch to TV, please.
Okay. It's set to TV.
Okay. We're not getting a signal.
Okay. I'll go to TRANSMIT, Joe.
Okay. You can continue reading back.
Okay. Roll 180, pitch 228, yaw 001; N/A; plus 0017.9, 6652.2, 7:37, 6626.5 and I missed sextant shaft; - trunnion - trunnion, 15.7, Zeta Sagittarius, up, 08.0; roll 2.1; minus 22.81, minus 00 - correction, minus 025.00, 1140.7, 34087, 013:32:14.

Roger, Fred. Readback correct. The sextant star is 26, and the shaft is 15.54. Over.
Okay. Sextant star 26 and 15.54.
Roger. And we have a picture now; however, it's moving around quite a bit, if you could hold the camera a little steadier. And I have your - -
- - Okay, Joe. There's nothing but clouds outside, and when we get some land down there coming up, I'll switch back to the window. I thought I'd just show you Jim here, to make sure he's still here.
Okay; real fine. We had a good picture of Jim there for a minute. I have the lift-off plus 8 pad, Fred. If you're ready.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. GETI, 008:00; DELTA-V<sub>T</sub>, 7835; longitude, minus 165; GET 400 K, 022:36. Over.
Okay. 008:00, 7835, minus 165, 022:36.
Okay, then. And I have a TLI pad for you.
Okay. I'm ready.
TLI: 2:26:05, 179, 108, 000, 5:47, 10416.9, 35587, 358, 139, 320, 302, 319, 040. Ejection time, 4 plus 01 plus 00. Over.
Okay. TLI: 2 plus 26 plus 05, 179, 108, 000, 5 plus 47, 10416.9, 35587, 358, 139, 320, 302, 319, 040, and ejection time, 4 plus 01 plus 00.
Roger, Fred. Readback correct, and we're getting a nice color TV picture now. If you have any commentary to go with it.
Okay, Joe. I'll tell you, I'm just trying to figure out where we are here.
That's your job, not mine.
You know, I've just been up out of the LEB for a short time here, and I'm trying to find out which country we're over.
I have to keep telling Jack that the blue stuff down there is water.
I'll give you a hint. You're in the western hemisphere.
Okay, Joe. It appears like that we've crossed out into the Gulf of Mexico here, and I've got a peninsula or an island that's down there. I don't know whether you can see it.
Roger, Jack. We see that. Of course, there's a lot of cloudcover and you see it more clearly than we do, but it does look like the Earth, not the Moon.
Apollo 13, Houston. We've had LOS MILA now. Thank you very much.
Apollo 13, Houston. Request P00 and ACCEPT for a state vector. Over.
Roger, Houston. We're in P00 and ACCEPT.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. The computer is yours, Jim.
Thank you, - -
And you are GO for TLI. Huntsville reports that you have a 6-second propellant pad which is 3 seconds more than a 3-sigma case; so you're good on consumables. The IU is so good that we're not going to update it. The only change we have for you is in the TLI checklist. At 57 minutes where you slew the FDAI to 18 degrees, we recommend 20 degrees there, and we recommend that you look for 8 degrees instead of 6 degrees at ignition. The S-IVB is riding on the top of its deadband.
- - Understand; and just out of curiosity, was that engine out to use up more S-IVB fuel?
The engine out did cause you to use more S-IVB fuel - about a 10-second-longer burn; but you're still GO.
Okay. Thank you.
And, 13, Houston. We're ready to support pyro arm and docking probe extension whenever you're ready.
Okay, Houston. Docking probe has been extended and all indications are nominal. We're down to PYRO ARM now and we're getting ready.
Okay, Jim.
Okay, Houston. My circuit breaker's armed - or closed; SEQUENTIAL LOGIC, two, on and up and we're ...
Okay, 13. You are GO for pyro arm.
And, Houston, 13. Were you reading us?
Roger, 13. Go ahead.
Roger. We have our SEQUENTIAL ARM circuit breakers in and our SEQUENTIAL LOGIC, two, on and up and we are just standing by for your confirmation for a GO.
Sorry, 13. You didn't copy. You are GO for pyro arm. Over.
Okay; fine. Thank you.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
About 2-1/2 minutes to LOS, Jim, and your AOS at Carnarvon will be 2 plus 25 plus 50. Over.
Roger. AOS at Carnarvon 2 plus 25 plus 50.
That's affirm.
Apollo 13, Houston. LOS in about 1 minute. At LOS we would like COMMAND RESET and then NORMAL.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston through Carnarvon.
Okay, Joe. Read you loud and clear. We are sitting here monitoring time base 6 ... countdown; we're 20 seconds away.
Okay. We're just starting to get data, and everything still looks good to us.
Hey, Joe. At 2 hours and 12 minutes, the O<sub>2</sub> FLOW HIGH light came on, and it's been pegged high ever since, so it's been on about 14 minutes now.
Roger, 13. We're looking at it.
Time base 6.
Copy. Time base 6.
Okay. Apollo 13, Houston. You have a GO for all systems, and the O<sub>2</sub> FLOW HIGH check is nominal with the WASTE TANK VENT open at this time, and it's no sweat.
Okay. Just wanted you all to check it for me.
Okay. We did.
Thank you.
Apollo 13, Houston. We will be losing data from Carnarvon in about 1 minute. We'll probably have voice through ARIA. Everything is hunky-dory, and we will be listening for you to tell us how the burn goes.
Okay, this is 13. We are standing by, too.
Apollo 13, Houston through ARIA. Just a COMM check. Over.
Reading you clear ...
Okay, Jim. It's not the best, but we are reading you.
Roger.
Ignition, Houston.
Copy that, Jim. Good deal.
Everything's okay so far.
Houston; Roger.
... at 38.
We're getting a little vibration during this burn.
Houston; Roger.
It's off. Engine off.
Houston. Copy. Engine off.
13, Houston. We'll have you through Hawaii in 3 minutes.
Roger. Through Hawaii in 3 minutes.
Apollo 13, Houston through Hawaii. Over.
13 through Hawaii. How do you read?
13, Houston. You're weak but clear; it will probably get better in a second. We're standing by for the burn report.
Roger.
13, Houston. The booster reports that everything looks good with the S-IV.
Sounds good, Houston. The ride was very nominal. We a little vibration, though, during most of the run.
Okay. We copied your call on that, Jim.
Okay, Joe. the DSKY read 35560, plus 04445, plus 01769, and DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 3.0.
Roger. You can't ask for much better than that. How about the burn time? Did you notice?
Okay. On my trusty watch, I had about 3-3/4 seconds long.
Okay. Copy that.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Roger, Houston; 13 here.
Okay. We have the S-IVB maneuver to SEP attitude commencing at 2 plus 56 plus 37. Duration of the maneuver: 4 minutes. SEP time, 3 plus 06 plus 37. Over.
Okay. If I heard those right, Joe, the S-IVB maneuver was 2 plus 56 plus 57. SEP time is 3 plus 06 plus 27.
Correction on the second; 2 plus 56 plus 37, and 3 plus 06 plus 37.
Okay. 2 plus 56 plus 37, with the maneuver time and the SEP time, 3 plus 06 plus 27?
That's plus 37, too. Exactly 10 minutes later, Fred.
Okay; 37.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
We see the booster doing all the right things, and FIDO says your trajectory looks good, and it looks like we'll stick with a pretty close to nominal midcourse, too. We'll have some numbers for you later.
Okay. And we concur. The S-IVB is maneuvering at this time.
Roger.
And, Apollo 13, Houston. We'd like OMNI Alfa. Over.
13, Houston. Now request OMNI Charlie.
Roger. OMNI Charlie.
And, 13, we'll be doing a handover, now.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston. You are GO for T&D.
Okay, Joe. Thank you.
And, 13, Houston. Check your NOUN 17 for extraction pitch attitude. It should be 319 degrees. Over.
Okay. We'll look at it.
Okay, Houston; 13. Do we have a GO for pyro arm?
13, Houston. Affirmative. You're GO for pyro arm, and recommend you secure the cabin pressurization.
We did. We closed the waste management vent valve, there. Or waste stowage valves - -
Okay. We're reading 6 psi on the cabin, Jack.
Roger, Joe. Thank you very much.
Yes, that's quite a bang, Joe. We've separated, and we've pitched around about 60 degrees now.
Roger, Jack. We see you pitching.
Okay. We got the SLA panels - one of them is out front now.
Ah, so.
Got the S-IVB. I guess we're about 80 feet.
Good deal.
Okay. I'm going to come on with the TV now, Joe.
Okay, Fred. We're waiting for it.
13, Houston. We've got a groovy TV picture.
Sounds good.
Is the focus good enough, Joe, that you can see all the glittering debris?
We've seen some debris, Fred. The booster itself is a little bit bright. What's your f-stop?
Okay. I'm at 22.
Why don't you go up a click and let us have a look at that.
Okay. You're at 44 now.
Okay. Let's stay there for now and I assume you're in peak.
Affirmed.
13, Houston. Recommend RATE 2 on the BMAGs.
Thank you.
It's getting bigger.
As you might know, Joe, I've got the center seat, again and I can't see a thing.
Too bad.
I gave him the TV monitor.
Okay, I'm going to be moving the TV directly. I'm going to pull it out of this bracket, Jim.
13, Houston. Did you call?
Roger. I'm going to be moving the TV to get a better shot here - moving it out of this bracket.
Okay, Fred. It's just beginning to cut off at the bottom, but it's still a very good picture.
That's a good picture, Fred.
Yes, we are just about there. About 10 more feet now.
Roger.
Everything looks pretty good down in the S-IVB, too. The shroud still looks intact down there.
Good deal. There is really quite a bit of detail on this picture.
Okay. We've got two - two barber poles.
Houston; Roger.
Okay. You should be able to see down into the portion of the IU right now, Joe.
Fred, Houston. We'd like to try going to AVERAGE on the TV for a minute or so.
Okay. You've got AVERAGE, and a little yellow dust cap just floated by in front of us.
Yes. We see it at the top of the screen.
Fred, after a few minutes of this, at your convenience, we could use some interior shots if you get the time and if the lighting is good.
Okay.
And, 13, Houston. The S-IVB vent times are nominal as in the flight plan within a few seconds.
We're hard docked, Houston.
Roger. Understand. Good deal. Fred, one more thing on the TV. If you could come to f:22 again - -
Okay. You've got f:22 again.
And, Houston, Fred will handle the camera as we go through the postdocking checklist.
Okay, Jim. Real good.
Okay, Joe. I am pointing it over toward Jack, and it's pretty bright with the Earth out that window. Is that sort of washing out the picture here?
No, Fred, it's not. We've got a bright spot where the window is. The rest of you are semi-silhouetted. It's a pretty impressive picture.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
For Fred. The IOS [?] has caught you with the fuel cell reactant values in latch again.
Touché.
And we have word that the propellant usage for T&D was nominal.
Okay, what is nominal, please?
Well, I didn't ask that yet, Jack; stand by one.
Okay (laughter).
Fred, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. With the direct sunlight from the window, out of the TV camera field as it is now, we'd like you to open it up an f-stop or so and, if convenient, try to keep that bright spot out of the window.
Okay.
13, Houston. I guess we could stand one more twick down on the f-stop.
Okay, Joe. He's going to do it.
That is, we want you to open it up. Looks like a very interesting book you're reading.
I have two of them.
Hey, that's pretty, Fred.
Okay. I hope you got more detail than I have on the monitor here.
No. We probably don't, but it's kind of a neat picture anyway.
Houston, we are now going to finish repressurizing the tunnel.
Houston; Roger.
... probably hear, Joe, we're just finishing pumping up Aquarius here.
Okay. About all we see on this picture, Fred, are the bright spots with the lights around the tunnel area. The hatch itself is pretty dark.
13, Houston. By the way, we'd like to know how the high gain antenna lockup worked. Our signal strength is a little bit lower than we thought it would be.
It looked just the way I expected it to, Joe. I had her sitting there in REACQ with the numbers cranked in and soon as we got pretty much through the rotation, I just threw it down to HIGH GAIN and it appeared to lock right up.
Okay. Good deal. See that flashlight beam wandering around in there.
Houston, 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
We'd kind of like to hold off on the - start the venting again until we get the things - pumped back up inside here. Wonder if you might give us a call to remind us when to initiate that.
Okay, 13; will do.
And we'll try to shift her up to look up into the tunnel here.
Okay. Real good.
Okay, 13; Houston. I think we could use an f-stop lower. What f-stop are you in now?
I'm about as low as you can go, Joe. I'm sitting on 4.4.
Okay.
What you're looking at, Joe, is the commander has removed the hatch and is proceeding to stow it.
Okay, 13. That's a pretty good picture there.
The CDR is verifying the docking latches now.
Roger.
Hey, Joe. Jim reports that there's a slight, you know, burn smell up in the tunnel area, as been reported on previous flights.
Okay. We copy that.
Okay. The commander reports all docking latches latched.
Houston; Roger.
13, Houston. For your information, the S-IVB vent is proceeding on schedule.
Okay, Joe.
Yes, Joe. That's - That's concurring with all the thousands of particles that I see going by outside here.
Yes. I guess I didn't need to tell you.
13, it looks like Jim is connecting the umbilical at this time. Is that right?
Yes, that's affirm - affirm, Joe. Do you have any detail up in there at all? On the monitor it looks like I can - I can make out the drogue - the drogue a little bit, but not much else.
We can see the probe pretty well, and we can see his hands quite well there.
Okay. We're powering the LM now, Joe.
Okay, Roger that.
And the voltage looks good there, 13.
Roger.
Okay. We're going to take an outside view now, out the left side, Joe.
Okay, Fred. Real good.
Okay. You making out the picture there, Joe?
Yes. Is that the world?
Okay, Fred. That's pretty nice looking picture. We'd like to know what settings you used to get that.
Okay. I think Jim is holding it now and - it - Okay, it should be in about f:22, infinity, and I think the 50-millimeter. And Jim says he thinks he hit Baja in the picture now.
Okay. I think we can stand to go to f:44 on that. The clouds are pretty bright.
Okay. We are going to have to press on here, Joe, so we are back inside.
Okay. Thanks a lot.
Okay. How's that picture looking back outside now, Joe? Getting ready for LM extraction.
Okay. That looks pretty good, Fred.
Houston, this is 13. Do we have a GO for pyro arm?
13, Houston. Affirmative. You're GO for pyro arm.
Hey, Joe, when we went back up and rechecked the tunnel there, we found two latches that weren't cocked and we reset them.
I'll roger that, Jack.
Joe, I've got a beautiful view of the Earth out window 1.
Roger, Jack.
By the way, the windows came through in real good shape. Window 5 looks real clean, so I am kind of hopeful that Hycon stuff will be pretty good.
Good deal.
I meant window 3, Joe.
Okay, 13; Houston. You're GO for LM SEP whenever you're ready.
Roger.
Okay, 13; Houston. Correction on that. You're GO for LM SEP at the nominal time and - or later. We don't want it early.
Okay, Joe. We'll do it at 04:01:00.
Roger.
Okay. We're about ready to pull the LM out, Joe.
Okay, 13.
Here she comes.
Okay. Looks like we're clear, Joe.
Okay. Looks good. It's weird because we get the TV about 10 seconds after you call it.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'll be waiting for you to tell us that you feel you're safely clear of the booster, and give us the GO to command the booster in its yaw maneuver.
13, Houston. Did you copy my last about giving us a GO for the yaw?
Yes, we're maneuvering, Joe, and we hadn't picked her back up again yet.
Okay. Do you want to wait till you acquire it before we yaw it?
How much time do you have, Houston? Can you wait, or do you want to do it right now?
We can wait if you want us to, Jim.
Why don't you wait just a little bit.
Okay.
Joe, did they ever get an idea of what that - the TD and E fuel was?
Jack, they're not willing to pin it down to a specific number right now because they say the tanks will warm up later on and the apparent consumption will go down. But it was nominal.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We have the S-IVB in sight. You are GO to maneuver the S-IVB.
Houston, Roger that.
Try to give you a - Houston, we're going to try to give you a shot of the S-IVB with the TV out window number 3.
Okay. Real good, Jack. Our S-band signal strength has been fluctuating. Does it seem to be going all right up there in the AUTO TRACK mode?
Yes. Right now; yes, it's dropped off to about the 70-percent point, Joe, and it was before up about 85.
Okay.
And, Houston, do you have a TV picture?
Not at the moment, Jim. We had a garbled one there for a few seconds, and we don't have one at this moment.
Okay. I can see the S-IVB now out the hatch window and it's - -
Okay, Jim. Suddenly we have a very good picture.
Okay.
And, Houston, I can see the gold shroud around the IU, and it looks that it's all intact.
Roger, Jim. We copy that. Incidentally, the APS evasive maneuver will be about 4 minutes late. It'll be at about 04 plus 18.
Roger.
13, Houston. Wonder if you could zoom in on that S-IVB for us a little bit?
Okay.
Yes, yes. More like that. That's nice. It's off our screen to the right, now.
Oh, that's very nice, very nice.
Okay, Joe. Is EECOM monitoring the O<sub>2</sub> FLOW HIGH light again? We haven't yet started the venting yet.
Okay. Stand by. I'll check.
13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jack, your cabin REGs are still making up, but you're GO to open the waste management vent again at this time, and we'll delta the time to close it by the appropriate amount for you.
Okay. Real fine. Well, we'll wait till the S-IVB does its maneuver here.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. We just had a momentary dropoff in signal strength again there.
Roger, Fred. We had an LOS for a minute and we lost our TV picture. It looks like - yes, we Just got it back. It looks great again.
13, Houston. You might stop the f-stop down one more notch, if you got any left.
And, 13, Houston. We'll be commanding the evasive maneuver in about 17 seconds.
Okay, Joe. We can see it start to move. However, it doesn't seem to be a lot of debris or vapor coming out of it.
Roger that, Jack. Booster says that's great. He says the booster's doing its thing normally. Concur. We don't see much on the television at all.
And, Apollo 13, Houston. We'd like to change the S-band and antenna configuration. Like you to go OMNI Delta. Like you to go MANUAL mode on the high gain with pitch of minus 60 and yaw of 90. Over.
Okay. You want us to OMNI Delta and MANUAL on the high gain to minus 60 and plus 90. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
Okay, Houston. How much longer would you like the television?
Stand by on that. We'll get a word.
Okay, 13; this is Houston. You can turn the TV off anytime you're ready. We've enjoyed the show.
13, Houston. Before you secure the TV, we'd like to know whether that was in maximum zoom, just for information.
That's affirm. Jim had it in MAX zoom.
Okay. Good deal. That was a real good picture.
And, 13, Houston. The APS evasive maneuver appeared to be nominal. The LOX dump time is now 4 plus 39 plus 20, about 3 minutes late.
Roger.
Okay, Joe. We are right now opening the WASTE STOWAGE VENT.
Okay, Jack. We copy.
Okay, Houston. We are charging battery B.
Roger, 13. We see it. Looks good.
Apollo 13, Houston. Request OMNI Alfa now. Over.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger. They are having trouble verifying that the high gain is doing its thing. Like to verify that the pitch is minus 10, the Y is plus 350, you're in WIDE BEAM WIDTH and AUTO.
Okay. Minus 10 pitch, plus 350 yaw, and WIDE BEAM WIDTH and going into AUTO. You want HIGH GAIN, John?
That's affirm.
Okay. Here, it's coming at you.
All right, Houston; 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Is the S-IVB doing something different now?
Well, I don't know. It should be - let's see, it should have started the LOX dump at least quite a while ago. I guess that's complete. Why do you ask, Fred?
I'm looking out window 5 at what I think is the S-IVB, and I'm seeing what looks to be double plumes, going in two very narrow bands maybe about 3 degrees that are streaming out from it. And then there is a less dense band that covers maybe a 40-degree swath through the sky that continues out, also, in two directions.
Hey, Joe, what it looks like, kind of, is if you pull up behind a guy that's pulling a contrail, and you get in his contrail, like he's going away from you - there's a long contrail -
Okay; stand by. Let me see what Frank's got to say about that.
Except we're between - Looks like we're between two contrails, one guy above and one below.
Roger.
It's a very pretty sight.
Okay, 13; Houston. The booster says that the propulsive dump is concluded; he now has the nonpropulsive vents open and what you see is a normal phenomenon and it should go on for another 5 minutes or so.
Okay.
And, while I've got you, 13, at your convenience, we'd like to have the results of the EMS bias tests that you did pre-TLI and pre-SEP.
Stand by.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. The TLI - the DELTA-V no bias test prior to TLI, we had a 0.8, and post-TLI, it was 1.0.
Okay, Jack. Copy that. Thank you very much. Incidentally, as your tracking gets better and better, the size of MCC-2 is getting lower and lower and figures to be somewhere between 20 and 30 feet per second now.
Sounds good.
Yes, sure does.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. We have a PTC REFSMMAT ready, if you're ready to go P00 and ACCEPT, we'll stick it in there.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay.
Okay. I'm P00 and ACCEPT, Joe.
Okay. Roger that.
Apollo 13, Houston. We'll have a handover in half a minute or so. You may get a momentary loss of strength.
Okay, Joe.
Apollo 13, Houston. The computer is yours. Over.
Okay. Going to BLOCK.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. Do you copy 13's torquing angles on the P52?
13, Houston. Leave them up just a second, and we'll get them down.
13, Houston. Okay. We got them.
Okay. The time of torquing was 5 hours 30 minutes and 40 seconds.
Roger. We copy.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. I just got all hooked up to get in my COMM system here, and I just wanted to check out. I've got my suit stowed, a few other odds and ends done, and I'm back in business again.
Okay. Good deal. We're kind of hanging loose down here. I've got a lift-off plus 15 pad. There's no hurry to read it up, so let us know when you're ready.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. Go ahead with the pad.
Okay, Jim. Lift-off plus 15 pad: GETI 015:00, DELTA-VT 5622, longitude minus 165, and GET 400K 047:04. Over.
Okay, Houston. Lift-off plus 15: GETI 015:00, 5622, minus 165, 047:04. Is that correct?
That's right, Jim.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Jim.
Roger. We'd like to have the ATTITUDE SET switch back to GDC, if you're finished with your aline. It gives GNC down here a telemetry problem.
Yes; okay.
Thank you.
I'm just going to give them one more aline here.
Okay. No rush.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Would you please verify or tell us what S-band antenna configuration you're in, please?
Okay. Stand by.
We're in HIGH GAIN.
Roger. Stand by a minute, Jim. Our signal strength is getting a little low. We may have a recommendation.
13, Houston. Are you in MANUAL or AUTO in HIGH GAIN?
Stand by. We're in AUTO TRACK, Joe, and HIGH GAIN.
Roger.
Houston, you copy 13?
Hello, Houston; Apollo 13. Over.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Hey, were you copying my P23 results?
That's affirmative, Jack. We followed you through the whole thing. You're ahead of schedule.
Okay.
And, Joe, we confirmed there is no midcourse-1. Over.
That is affirmative as far as I know. Let's get a final check on it, Jim.
Okay. Because we're standing by. We want to do a fuel cell purge and a waste water dump.
Okay, Jim. We confirm there will be no midcourse-1.
Okay. It sounds good.
And, 13, Houston. You can go ahead with the purge and dump at your discretion.
Roger, Houston. What we're going to do is, we're going to get rid of Fred's suit here. Fred's suit has been right in the commander's slot here for the last half hour. So we're going to try and get it stowed.
Okay.
You did a pretty good job.
Apollo 13, Houston. We'll have a handover in about 1 minute.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 13.
Roger, Jim. We'll have a handover from Hawaii to Goldstone in about 30 seconds.
Say again, Houston.
We'll be handing over from Hawaii to Goldstone in a few seconds. You may get a temporary loss of COMM.
Okay, Houston. We've got a whole bunch of noise, too.
Okay. Houston, 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Hey, Joe. Do you want to dump waste water down to 25 percent. Is that right?
That's affirm.
Okay, in work.
Okay.
Do you know we're also purging fuel cells O<sub>2</sub> now.
Okay, Jack.
Okay, Houston. The fuel cell purge and waste water dump are complete.
Roger, Apollo 13. And this is your relief CAP COMM shift on now.
Well, good evening, Vance.
Boy, you sure made it back fast.
Yes. You guys had a beautiful launch, there. Really nice.
Could you follow it all the way up, Vance?
No, I didn't see staging. It was too hazy for that, but we could see it for a few miles anyway.
I'll tell you, it's sure an interesting ride.
Right.
Houston, Apollo 13.
Roger. Go ahead, Jim.
Roger. We're at that stage now where we're going to take some Earth weather photography. If you're standing by, I have the camera aimed at the Earth right now, and I'll give you a mark when I take this first picture.
Roger. We copy, Jim. We'll be standing by for the mark.
Okay, Houston. 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Roger, copy.
And Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
For the PTC, recommend that you disable quads A and B. Over.
Okay. Disable quads A and B, will do; and soon as Jack gets finished thrashing around, we'll be going to that PTC mode.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We're starting PTC. We're disabling quads A and B now.
Roger, Apollo 13. Houston copies.
Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Jim, we'd like to verify that the high gain is secured, that the S-BAND antenna is on OMNI, and OMNI B should be the right antenna. Over.
Okay. You want the high gain secured and you want the OMNI on OMNI Charlie, huh? Or Baker?
That's affirm. And this'll be maintained in the PTC.
Okay.
And the high gain angles for stowage - or for stowing - are pitch minus 52, yaw 270.
Houston, Apollo 13.
Roger. Go ahead.
Stand by for another Earth weather picture. I'll give you a mark.
Okay. Standing by, Jim.
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Houston copies.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Houston here. Your rates look very stable. It looks like your rates are damped out completely here. As far as we can see, it would be alright to start the PTC.
Okay. We'll give it a try.
Hello, Houston. This is 13. How do you read?
Hello, 13; Houston. Loud and clear. 13, Houston is reading loud and clear. How do you read?
Okay. And do you have any estimate, Vance, on how long we'll be charging battery B?
Stand by 1, Fred.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'll be charging for 4-1/2 to 5 hours yet, Jim.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Fred, recommend that, when your window comes around facing the Earth again, that you catch another one of those pictures, and at the same time, you should probably start PTC again. We might have sent a confusing bit of info up to you. The "disable two quads" only applies to an early step in the procedure. We didn't mean that for the latter part of the procedure where we have the statement "enable all jets." Over.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 13.
Apollo 13, Houston. Go ahead.
Vance, Fred said that you had some more information about PTC and a different way of establishing it or something, huh?
Roger. Referring to the procedure on G/8-2, if you have that open, I'll tell you what we had to give you.
Okay. Stand by and I'll get it out.
Okay.
Okay. Go ahead, Van.
Okay. On checklist G/8-2 under step 5, there's a statement, "disable all jets on two adjacent quads," and that's what we were referring to when we called up saying "disable quads A and B." So that's all fine; however, going down now to step 7 where it says "enable all jets," we hoped that you didn't think we meant leave A and B disabled there. In that case, it's as written. All jets should be enabled. Over.
Okay. Our checklist has "all jets" scratched out, and it says "enable couples on all axes." So what we'll do is - we'll reestablish this thing and come down to that step 7, and we'll enable all jets. That means enable quads A and B. Is that right?
That's affirm. You'll have A, B, C, and D enabled for step 7.
Okay, real fine. I'll start on it now.
Okay. Understand you're going to reestablish it.
And Vance, on that picture, I was all set to shoot it just a little before you called, and the Earth hasn't showed up in the window yet. I don't know if we got too far off the bellyband or what.
Roger. Copy, Fred.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Roger. On the photo, you'll probably have to reestablish the attitude for PTC and then whenever it comes into the window again, why we'll just be standing by for the photo.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, ...
Roger, You're coming in a little weak. Have a recommended roll rate for this PTC, if you could copy.
Alright. Go ahead.
Okay. Recommend that you put in R<sub>1</sub> the following: 03750, and that should give you exactly a rate of 0.3 degrees per second. Over.
Okay. Enter 03750. Is plus or minus our choice?
Roger. The same direction you rolled the last time, which I believe is plus.
Okay.
Hey, Vance, would you monitor our rates and kind of give an idea of when you think they're stable enough to start PTC.
Roger, Jack. We'll take a look and let you know as soon as they look stable enough.
Okay. I've got quads A and B disabled here.
Roger.
Have they come up with an idea of how much fuel I used on the docking and also the P23 session at 5 hours or 6 hours.
I think we can give you something. Stand by a minute.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. It's looking good so far as RCS consumables are concerned, Jack. You're standing about 20 pounds above the curve right now. Looking at the TD&E, you expended 65 pounds or - Stand by - 55 pounds, correction on that.
How much?
And 14 pounds on P23s. You used a little more out of quad A than out of the others.
Okay. Thanks, Vance.
Roger.
Hey, could you say again the TD&E fuel? We've got a different - we all heard different things.
I said 65 and then corrected that to 55 pounds.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. Your rates look good. It's okay to start the roll again, if you'd like.
...
Hello, Houston; Apollo 13.
Apollo 13, go ahead.
Okay. Ready for a little count here, Vance, and I'll shoot another picture. We found the Earth again.
Okay. We'll be standing by, Fred.
A 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Roger. Copy.
Hey, Houston, 13.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. Stand by for a mark on another picture.
Okay. Standing by, Fred.
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Okay, we got it.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, Houston here. Two items: first of all, your PTC is looking very good and it should carry you through the night; second point, have a procedure to give you, if you're ready to copy. We'd like to set three bits in the computer, and I'll explain why.
Go ahead, Vance, we're ready to copy.
Okay. The procedure is as follows: VERB 25, NOUN 07, ENTER; 1331, ENTER; 7, ENTER; and ENTER. Explanation as follows. During the P23s, there was one time when VERB 37 was entered into the computer at about 16 seconds after the OPTICS ZERO switch was flicked to ZERO. This is a very uncommon anomaly in that, if you do this during - 0.4-second interval at around 16 seconds after you zero the optics, some OPT-mode bits are reset; and this would mean that, if you had a OCDU fail, it wouldn't be indicated; so all this procedure is doing is setting these three bits back again where they should be.
Okay, Vance, and I guess I'll try to be slower on that VERB 37.
Yes. Actually slower or faster, either one, I guess. Well, yes, slower. It's a very unusual thing to have that happen.
Okay. And, Houston, stand by for a mark on another picture.
Roger. Standing by.
3, 2, 1-
MARK it.
Roger. We copy, Fred.
Okay, Vance; we've completed that procedure, and let me know if everything was okay.
Okay, thank you. We'll let you know if anything isn't okay. I'm sure it's good now.
Tell GNC and GUIDO thanks a lot for keeping good track of me, there.
Roger. They're right on the ball.
And, 13, Houston. If you would like, we can let you know about every 2 minutes before the Earth should be coming into your window. We think we've got it pegged down pretty well now, and you won't have to look for it so much. You want that?
Yes. That would be fine, Vance.
Okay.
And, 13, Houston. GUIDO says the bits are reset - rather, are set.
Okay, thanks much.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
It's time for Fred to start looking for the Earth, should be coming by in about a couple of minutes.
Okay. He's got his head out there right now.
Yes. You've got that pretty well pegged, man. There it be.
Doesn't that give you confidence?
Yes. I guess so. In a minute, you're going to hear my kitchen timer ding, and that also says the Earth is there.
Okay.
Okay. Stand ... countdown.
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Roger. We copy.
Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We're enjoying Fred's music there.
Yes, ... up here.
Yes, I kind of like it too, Vance.
Yes, we didn't hear much of it, though.
Houston, Apollo 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Vance, we did another EMS null bias test and the - it went from 100.0 to 101.8 in 100 seconds.
Roger. We copy.
13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Jack, like to verify, was that 100 to 100.8 or 101.8?
101.8.
Roger.
It was plus 100 to plus 101.8.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
The Earth's coming up in the window again in 1 to 2 minutes.
He's got it. You're right again.
Okay, stand by for a mark here.
Roger.
Okay, ready? 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Roger, copy your mark.
Apollo 13, Houston. We have a CSM state vector to send you. Request P00 and ACCEPT at your convenience.
Okay, Vance. There's P00 and ACCEPT.
Okay, it's coming up.
13, the computer is yours again.
Okay, going back to BLOCK.
Roger.
Looks like picture-taking time again.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Van.
Okay, Earth should be coming into view.
Okay. I got it.
Okay. Stand by, Vance. 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Roger. We got it.
Earth starting to look pretty small now?
Well, looking at here, Vance, it's hard to be convinced it's even the Earth. All we see is water and clouds.
Well, I guess that's what we want. We want pictures of weather, right, clouds.
Yes, about half of it's covered with clouds.
Houston, Apollo 13.
This is Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Van. Ready to copy in the torquing angles of the P52 option 3?
That's affirm - that's affirm, but stand by.
Okay.
Okay. We've got them. Go ahead with the torquing, Jack.
Okay. That was stars 20 and 27 and star-angle difference is five balls, and the time at torquing would be 10 hours 40 minutes 15 seconds.
1 hour 40 minutes and 15 seconds; 20 and 27, stars; and five balls. Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Time to look out your window for us again.
Lo and behold.
Okay. It's 3, 2, 1-
MARK.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, we're coming up on a handover between sites. You might lose COMM momentarily.
Okay. Understand handover, we might lose the COMM.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
You should have the Earth coming into view here shortly.
Okay.
We got a new CAP COMM now.
No, I changed my voice.
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Roger. Copy.
Negative, Houston. Say again.
We got your mark, Jim.
Okay.
Hey, you still there, Van?
Roger. Go ahead.
I guess the world really does turn. I can see some of my landmasses now. It must be Australia down near the bottom and I guess we haven't really figured out what's over the - to the left. It must be some part of Asia. China, probably.
Hey, maybe the fact that you verified that the Earth really turns, we can call this Haise's theory, huh?
Very good, Vance. Very good.
...
No, seriously. Very interestingly, we can see on the map now that you're between Guam and Hawaii and a little bit north, and you're almost out 60 000 miles.
Yes. I just did a P21 and we had 55 900.
Okay. That's pretty good.
I'll let you look at it again here.
Incidentally, we're looking at a replay of your TD&E stuff here and the TV looks pretty good. First chance some of us had had to see it.
Okay, Vance. In R<sub>1</sub>, there's our altitude in tens of miles, 55 290.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Looking at our computations back here, we show you about 55 450 and going out rapidly now.
Well, Hal might be a little bit off.
Okay.
We have a sign underneath our LEB DSKY that "my name is Hal."
I can't imagine how that got there. Just remember, you have to be nice to Hal.
We will.
I think this PTC's going to work out good. I been watching it here for the last hour here.
Good. It's looking good here.
(Music - Aquarius)
Good Lord!
Houston, 13.
13, Houston. You're very weak. Please repeat.
Vance, to my calculations, we have taken about 10 Earth window photography pictures. I see nothing coming up here except to close the waste stowage vent here in a little while. I was thinking about getting squared away to bed down for the evening pretty soon.
Okay. That sounds good, Jim. FAO here would like to request just one more picture before you bed down, if you don't mind.
Okay. We'll come through with one more picture.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
A couple of items, Jim. The first is, the time for closing the waste stowage vent is 12:24. If you turn in before that time, why it's okay as far as we're concerned down here to close it before that time just before you go to bed. The second point, we have some results on the P23s, and, if Jack's interested, we could give him the corrected altitudes we're getting, and so forth.
Yes. I sure am, Vance.
Okay. This is preliminary results, but it will give you some indication. Corrected altitude is turning out to be 17 plus or minus 4 kilometers, and the fact that it's plus or minus 4 kilometers indicates that you're being very consistent in judging the altitude. The effective altitude is turning out to be 10 plus or minus 12 kilometers. Comments are that, as I said before, you're being consistent on the horizon selection. The substellar point error is averaging 15 arc-minutes and if you could hold the rates to a minimum, you might shoot for 5 arc-minutes. That's the only comment there. Over.
Okay. We'll try doing it better next time.
But, they're real satisfactory.
Okay. Thanks, Vance.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jack, this is the last time for the Earth coming into view in about 1 or 2 minutes.
Okay. I got my photographer looking out there.
Okay.
13, Houston. I just corrected. Actually, the Earth will come into view more times. It's just that we're ... to the photography. Over.
Okay.
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Roger. We copy, and could you give us the frame number on that last picture, please?
Okay. We've been writing them all down, Vance, as we went, but that one turned out to be 29.
Roger. Twenty-nine, Fred.
Okay, Jack says I can't read the camera very well. It should be 28 based on our start frame.
Correction to 28.
13, Houston. Understand, though, the number showing that you read on the camera was 28. Is that affirm?
Yes. The readability of that thing is like, you know, half a frame one way or the other; so, 28, I think, is a good number.
Okay.
(Music - Halls of Montezuma)
Roger. Houston copies.
I'll have to not wear it out before Jack gets there.
Sounds like that music's a pretty nice thing to have on a long voyage.
Yes, you're right.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Fred, did you get any MASTER ALARMS up there about 5 or 10 minutes ago? Folks thought they saw some here and they were curious about it.
Yes. We got another O<sub>2</sub> FLOW HIGH on - I guess it was about 5 minutes ago.
Okay.
Vance, what the people down there might have been seeing is our testing.
Roger. Testing the CAUTION and WARNING?
Yes. We were rigging the siren device over the MASTER ALARM, and we were running a test on it.
Okay. Good enough. And anytime you're ready to copy, I've got a pad P37 block data.
Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. P37 block data, starting with GETI. 025:00, 5119, minus 165, 071:08; 035:00, 7733, minus 165, 070:36; 045:00, 6208, minus 165, 094:52; 060:00, 5993, minus 165, 118:53. Over.
Okay. Stand by 1 minute.
Okay. 025:00, 5119, minus 165, 071:08; 035:00, 7733, minus 165, 070:36; 045:00, 6208, minus 165, 094:52; 060:00, 5993, minus 165, 118:53.
Roger. That's all correct.
Okay.
Houston, 13.
Roger. Go ahead.
We're starting our presleep checklist and no medication.
Okay. The Doc says very good.
And, Houston, is there any onboard readouts that you don't have from us.
Stand by 1. We need the LM/CM DELTA-P for one thing, and I'll check back in a minute with the others.
Okay. And we still have the vent valve open. We'll close it one of the last things and looking at LM/CM DELTA-P right now and I see 0.5 in psi indicated.
Roger. Five-tenths.
13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Only other readouts we need are those on page 3-13 of the flight plan. BAT C, pyro BAT A, pyro BAT B, RCS A, B, C, and D readings, and DC INDICATOR select main A or B.
Okay. Stand by.
And, Vance, we're still charging BAT B. Did you want to dispense with that in a few minutes?
Stand by on that, Fred.
Okay, Vance, I've got your readouts on page 3-13 of the flight plan.
Okay. Ready to copy.
Okay, BAT C is 37, pyro BAT A is 37, pyro BAT B is 37, RCS A 94 percent, B 95 percent, C 93 percent, D 96 percent.
Roger. Copy that.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. In answer to the battery-charging questions, I calculate it should be fully charged at 12:35. Play that one, though, the same as the waste vent. If you want to do it earlier because you're turning in, why that's fine with us.
Okay, we'll continue on with a few other things we got to get done, and just before turning in, we'll check with you, and you can remind us then.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 13. Give me a call when you're ready for E-memory dump.
This is Houston, 13. You are weak. Please repeat.
Okay, Vance, give me a call when you're ready for our E-memory dump.
Okay, 13. We're not quite ready yet. We'll give you a call when we're ready.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay, Vance. I understand you're ready.
Negative, GUIDO isn't quite ready yet.
Okay. I thought I heard you call us.
But we're ready now, Jack, so GUIDO says he's ready to take it.
On the way down.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 13.
13, Houston. Go.
Okay, Vance. Requesting clearance now to turn the vent valve back to CLOSE again, and also the battery charge off.
Roger. That's fine with us, Jim. Proceed.
Okay, we'll do that.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
We think the spacecraft's looking in good shape. Nobody has any comment down here before you hit the hay.
Okay. Row do they think we stand on the way of consumables so far?
You're looking in good shape in all respects - consumables-wise.
Okay. Real fine.
13, Houston.
Okay, go ahead, Vance.
Just the last comment, Jack. Would you clear Hal, please, so he doesn't burn his lights out there tonight?
No, I - I was just - I'll do that for you.
Okeydoke.
And we'll see you in the morning, huh?
Okay. It'll be just a minute or 2 yet. We have to finish up a couple more chores.
What do you mean? It is morning.
Hey, that's right.
It's been a long day, huh?
Yes, it sure was.
Hello, Houston. Houston, Apollo 13. Over.
Good morning, 13. This is Houston. How are you?
Read you loud and clear. We had a fairly good night's sleep.
Okay. Real fine. At your leisure, you can give us radiation reports, I guess. We are getting a consumables update together for you, and a few other little details whenever you are ready to talk. About the only major thing on the spacecraft is that it's been getting farther away.
Okay. Well, that's to be expected, I guess.
Yes.
And we're starting to charge battery A, Houston.
Roger on battery A, Fred. EECOM says battery B looks real good.
Okay.
Houston, 13.
Go ahead.
Okay. For information, Fred was on COMM last night; and he was over in the left-hand seat, and if you want our radiation readings, we just goofed. We left them all in the suits which are now nicely tucked away. We are going to get out Jack's suit in an hour or so anyway, and we'll get his dosimeter out if you wanted to get the reading on that one.
Okay. That will be satisfactory.
Okay.
And in exchange for that, the surgeon would like to have a rough number of hours each of you slept and a qualitative verb to describe whether it was good, fair, or poor.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay, Houston. We had an average of around 5 or ...
Jim, Houston. Your COMM got pretty garbled there just as you started to talk.
Okay. Houston, Apollo 13.
Okay, 13. You're loud and clear again.
We averaged about 5-1/2 hours' sleep apiece, and we are estimating that the sleep was good.
Okay. Copy that. Let's see what else we have for you, Jim. Midcourse-2 looks like about 23 feet per second, approximately retrograde and on time. And it's holding real firm now. For your information, and you don't need to copy this down, because it's still pretty soft, but we have an S-IVB impact of about 8.57 south and about 33.9 west, which is a little west and a little south of the flight plan value. We have it at a GET of about 77 plus 51 which is just before AOS, and the LOI pads are a little bit late, and as I say, it's still pretty soft, and we'll be updating you with firm numbers.
That's fine, Joe. Just as long as it doesn't hit Cone Crater.
Okay. And I'll have a consumables update for you in a little while, and I have a small flight plan update for you sometime a little later on when you're ready to copy. There's no big deals in it.
Roger.
And, 13, Houston. We'd like to verify that you cycled the O<sub>2</sub> cryo fans. We saw the H<sub>2</sub>, but we didn't see the O<sub>2</sub> get stirred up.
Yes, Joe. We did, and it kind of looked like we might have had a little stratification because right after we put them on, we had a CRYO PRESS light.
Okay. EECOM told me that might happen, and he was right.
Okay, Joe. We're ready to copy a flight plan update and your consumables.
Okay, Jack. The flight plan update has a couple of items in it, and the first one we'd like to do is to update the T<sub>ephem</sub> values in the G&C checklist on page G/9-2. These are fairly small changes, but in case you need them, we'd like you to have the exact numbers. Over.
Okay. Just a minute. I'll get it out.
Joe, was that the G&C checklist, page 9-2?
That's affirmative. G&C, page G/9-2.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. On that page in line 04, column B, change the number from 03366 to 05253. Over.
- - 53.
Okay. And in line 05, column B, change from 11000 to 33661. Over.
33661.
Okay. That's right. The only other thing I've got for you, Jack, is three additional questions for the booster systems debriefing, which is to take place at about 25 hours, and we thought we'd pass these questions up to you early so you can consider them. Over.
Okay. We're ready to copy.
Okay. The first extra is, and let me get the original question because this question says, "More specifically on item 2," and item 2 says, "Were there any significant changes in the noise vibration level during the single stage of powered flight?" Specifically, describe your observations during the early S-II center engine out-off, and approximately 90 seconds prior to TLI cut-off, you reported a high vibration in the S-IVB. We'd like you to describe the buildup of this vibration and its behavior through cut-off. Over.
Okay. Essentially, what you'd like us to talk about is vibration sequence during the early S-II cut-off of the center engine and also describe the vibrations that we encountered during the S-IVB TLI burn. Is that correct?
That's it. Okay. The second extra question is for you, Jim, and it says, "Comparing this flight with your ride on Apollo 8, were there any significant differences in the powered flight environment?"
Okay. We'll describe a comparison with 8 and 13 as far as powered flight goes.
Roger. And the last additional question is what did the ORDEAL ball look like during TLI? As you know, we passed you an update to that setting, and we'd like to know whether it was riding right on zero or what during the burn. Over.
Okay. Will do. We'll describe the ORDEAL ball.
Okay. That's it, and that's the whole flight plan update. I have a consumables update now if you want to listen to that.
Okay, Joe. We're ready to copy.
Okay. At 23 hours the total RCS is 1121, quad A is 274, quad Bravo is 286, quad Charlie is 274, quad Delta is 287, and the cryos are as follows: H<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 83 percent; H<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 86 percent; O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 87 percent; O<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 87 percent. Over.
Okay, Joe. We got all those, and how do we compare them with where we should be in the time line?
As I understand it, Jack, you're running slightly ahead of nominal in both those areas.
Okay; real fine.
No problem.
And, 13, Houston. That's all the business I got right now. I have a little news and plan of the day for you, if you feel like listening to that a little later on.
Just hold off a little bit there, Joe if you don't mind. ...
Stand by one, Jim. You're coming in garbled again.
Houston, 13.
Okay, 13; Houston. Loud and clear again. Go ahead.
Okay. Joe. On the news, Jim would like to hold off a little bit on that, and I want to make a request to FAO, if he will at sometime during the day, when we get a flight plan update with those activities we agreed to make optional during lunar orbit and the few activities we were going to delete, I think that I forgot and left that card back during the press of suiting, I left it in the suit room.
Okay. Wilco.
Okay, Jack. I understand FAO's working on that and we'll have something for you later on.
Okay. We're not in any hurry.
Roger.
Okay, Houston; 13.
Okay. Jack. We copy the angles. You can go ahead and torque them.
Okay. Joe. The time of torquing will be 23 hours 47 minutes 30 seconds.
We copy.
Houston, 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
For information, Joe, we're all configured back again now to our regular seating positions, if you're monitoring us.
Okay. Thank you, Jim.
Hello there, Houston; 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Gosh, we had forgotten, but we'd like to hear what the news is.
Okay. There's not a whole lot to it. Well, let's see, we'll start with the - Let's start with sports, what the heck. The Astros survived 8 to 7, the Braves got five or six runs in the - five runs in the ninth inning, but they just made it; and in the other important game of the day, the Cubs were rained out. I have all the rest of the scores, you can tell me if you want any of them. They had earthquakes in Manila and other areas of the island of Luzon. There were three tremors and they kept the buildings shaking for about a half an hour or so, and it was about a 5 on the Richter scale. Okay, let's see. The Beatles have announced they will no longer perform as a group. The quartet is reported to have made in excess of a half billion dollars during their short musical career. However, rumors that they will use this money to start their own space program are false.
Maybe we could borrow some.
(Laughter) Okay. Okay; West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, who witnessed your launch from the Cape yesterday, and President Nixon will complete their round of talks today. Brandt reportedly came to the U.S. to seek assurance from the President to go ahead with talks with the eastern European nations, especially East Germany, Poland, and Russia. Many air traffic controllers are still out, but reports indicate that they are slowly returning to work, and you'll be happy to know the controllers here in the MOCR are still on the job.
...
Go ahead.
I said thank goodness for that.
Okay. Some truck lines are being struck in the Midwest, and the school teachers have walked off the job in Minneapolis. Today's favorite pastime across the - Uh oh; have you guys completed your income tax?
How do I apply for an extension?
(Laughter)
Yes, Joe. I got to - hey, listen - It ain't too funny; things kind of happened real fast down there, and I do need an extension.
(Laughter)
I didn't get mine filed. And this is serious; would you - -
You're breaking up the room down here.
- - because I may be spending time in a - -
We'll see - -
I may be spending time in a - I may be spending time in another quarantine besides the one that they are planning for me.
We'll see what we can do, Jack. We'll get with Recovery and see if we can get the agent out there in the Pacific when you come back. By golly, let's see. In professional basketball, the Nicks beat the Milwaukee Bucks 110 to 102, and Billy Casper is leading the Masters after 54 holes with a 208, and spring football practice is in full swing. And that's about all the news we got; the updated plan of the day for you guys, the uniform will be service dress inflight coverall garments with swords and medals, and tonight's movie shown in the lower equipment bay will be John Wayne, Lou Costello, and Shirley Temple in the "The Flight of Apollo 13." Over.
Outstanding.
Houston, this is 13. Is it true that Jack's income tax return was going to be used to buy the ascent fuel for the LM?
Well, considering that he's a bachelor and hasn't got that deduction to take, yes.
Hey, Joe. I'm glad you brought that up, because I was really serious about that.
Okay, Jack. We'll - We'll take care of it. Tom Stafford says he'll get an extension for you.
Okay.
And Jim McDivitt says, "yes, now that you mention it, he forgot to fill the ascent stage."
(Laughter) Suspicions confirmed.
Should give you very good performance on descent.
We should have a lot more hover time, huh?
That's right.
Okay, crew. About the only other thing I've got for you right now is an update to your P37 pad for lift-off plus 35. This is a change to the pad we gave you yesterday. The reason for the update is for weather avoidance in the mid-Pacific landing area at 70 hours, which is the return time for this pad, and in case the question arises in your mind, we don't expect any problem there for the end of the mission. The weather area is 20 degrees south of your end-of-mission landing point, and it appears to be moving to the south.
Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the pad.
Okay. GET of ignition is 035:00, DELTA-V<sub>T</sub> 7883, Longitude minus 155, and the GET 400K 069:54. Over.
GETI is 035:00, 7883, minus 155, 069:54.
Okay.
And, Houston, Jack's going to try donning his suit now for practice, himself, and when he gets it out, we'll give you a dosimeter reading.
Okay. Real good.
Houston, Apollo 13.
13, Houston. Go.
Okay. We've retrieved Jack's dosimeter, and it's reading 02022.
Okay. We copy 02022 on the dosimeter, Jim.
That's affirm.
13, Houston. At your convenience, we'd like the LM/CM DELTA-P reading.
That reading is 0.65 psi.
Copy 0.65. Thank you.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Houston, Apol ... Roger. We're thinking together. And we're here waiting for your call.
Okay, you were a little broken up there, Jim, but I think it's getting better. We are ready for the launch-vehicle-systems debriefing whenever you are.
Okay, Houston; Apollo 13. You were cut out again; say again, please.
Roger, Jim. We are ready for the launch-vehicle-systems debriefing whenever you are. Over.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay, Houston; 13. In answer to Question 1, the changes in noise level occurred mainly between the first stage and the other stages - the other stages were about the same in noise level, very quiet, with the first stage, of course, making quite a bit of noise in the beginning but - which built up during the high Q, and then ... went quiet just after high Q.
Okay, copy that, Jim.
I might mention that the noise level during the first stage was not sufficient to be uncomfortable at all.
Roger. And I assume COMM was okay.
That's affirm. COMM was very good all during - throughout the entire flight. Much better than I expected.
Okay.
Now, in answer to Question 2, there was, of course, a vibration transient in the second stage that - due to the number 5 engine going out - which occurred shortly before the engine went out, and slightly after that then the S-II stage was very smooth.
Okay, Jim. I guess the significant point there is that you didn't notice the vibration before you saw the engine light.
That's right. We - we noticed the vibration but it wasn't such that we thought something catastrophic was going to happen; it just started vibration and then the EN light came on, and then the vibration went away and the stage itself was smooth.
Okay, copy that.
Yes, and that - it was all pretty - pretty short in span - just a second or so before and like a second afterwards, Joe.
Oh. Roger.
And on the S-IVB, the vibration of the vehicle itself wasn't what ... second ... powered flight - a very-high-frequency vibration.
That was - was that during - just during TLI, or did you notice that at insertion?
Well, it was a high-frequency viola - vibration but more noticeable during the TLI burn than it was during the ... flight.
Okay, I - understand.
I guess the S-IVB vibration during TLI was there all the time although it seemed to - to grow to us as the burn progressed, although that may have been just due to the boost weight decrease.
Okay, you called this about 3-1/2 minutes, but I guess the thing was slowly building up throughout the whole burn. Right?
That's right.
Okay, was it uncomfortable or did it cause your vision to degrade or anything like that?
No, it - it was not uncomfortable at all but I was recalling the ride on 8, and the S-IVB was more - much more smooth than even it was on 13.
Copy that.
Okay, now, in answer to number 3, we did not experience any unexpected transients except that all of us noticed the PU shift. We thought it was more pronounced than we had expected it to be.
Okay. Understand.
Joe, on that. I guess most of every time that PU shift occurred we all - almost all of us glanced at the engine light. We could feel definite acceleration change.
Roger. Understand, Jack.
And, during the high-Q portion of the flight, the Alfa meter, to my knowledge, nearly went above 25 percent.
Okay.
In answer to number 4, we got a pretty good look at the thermal shroud and the IU after taking the LM away, and from our viewpoint, the shroud was completely intact. I saw no loose particles or parts of it floating at all.
Okay, Jim. Understand.
And, I guess we answered number 5. I don't think at any time did we have any communication problem during powered flight.
Roger.
In answer to number 6, the answer is essentially no. We saw no venting or suspected leak on the LM or the CSM ...
Okay, Jim. I guess you described to us the non-propulsive venting on the S-IVB after the APS maneuver and we copied that at the time.
Okay. Fred saw the S-IVB venting.
Yes, we had already talked about that, Joe. And that was also visible when it - of course, when it did its evasive maneuver when we were looking at it right close up.
Roger.
Okay, Joe. The last time we saw the S-IVB positively was when Fred saw it venting at about - at about 5 hours. We think we might have picked it up later on. We saw a particle or something out there that was tumbling which might have been the booster or one of the SLA panels.
And when was that, Jim?
We're - we're debating. It was somewhere between - say 7:30 and 9 hours.
Okay.
But, Joe, assuming the S-IVB is still stable. The object I was looking at was definitely tumbling.
Okay, Fred. As I recall, it was stable then, although it's tumbling now.
Okay. It probably was the SLA panel I picked up.
Right. Incidentally, I guess the guys in building 6 - -
Oh and I think we -
Go ahead, Jim.
I - I think we answer to number 9. We - at around 5:32, I think, was when we think the number 5 light came on in the S-II, and a definite vibration which was more than just a high-frequency vibration we got with the normal S-IV burn, and then the light came on. I called ECO thinking from the training that it was 7:42 and looked up at the time and realized it was early. And then, soon after the light came on, the vibration stopped and the engine or the booster smoothed down. It was very smooth from there on.
Okay. This may be a stupid question, but do you have any idea what the frequency of it was?
Only to say that it was much higher - I couldn't really guess now. It was rather a rapid longitudinal vibration.
Okay, Jim. Stand by now for a minute, we're going to switch OMNI.
Houston, 13, ...
13, Houston. I read you. We still have quite a bit of noise on the loop.
I'll stand by. Roger.
Okay, Jim. It should be pretty good now. We copied you answering question number 9.
Do you want any more comments on the S-IVB vibrations?
I don't think so. When you get all done, I'll - I'll make a quick check to see if the booster people have any - any additional questions. You skipped number 8, Jim; could you go back to that for a second?
Okay, stand by.
Our only comment there, Joe, was that the burn on TLI, to our knowledge, was about 3-3/4 second longer than had been predicted and that was the only thing that we really noticed; otherwise, looked like PI [?] was nominal at cut-off.
Okay, understand.
Okay, on comparing the flight of 13 to Apollo 8, lift-off was about the same amount of vibration as I noticed on 8, but at the beginning of the flight, there was less of the sideways motion than we experienced on Apollo 8. The S-IC separation felt more violent on 13 than it did on 8, maybe that's because I was in a different seat, I don't know. But there was about three sharp transients of the cut-off and a couple of big bangs where we were thrown backwards longitudinally on our straps before the S-II went off. And the S-II was, of course, just as smooth on 13 as 8 except for the number 5 engine. And we did not experience the vibration that we experienced on 8 towards the end of the S-II burn. And the S-IVB was - had more vibration than we had on 8.
Okay, Jim, got all that.
The up - the update on the ORDEAL ball was a good one. At the burn, we were about - just about 8 degrees. We had to pitch down. The yaw was right on all the way through the entire burn, and just towards the end of the burn, the ball started going black in pitch a little bit.
Okay, sounds good, we'll give Mike Wash a gold star on that one. Okay, Jim, stand by 1 while I see if we have any extra questions.
Jim, while we're waiting to see if they have any more questions, I'd like to read you the booster people's preliminary analysis on the - the S-II cut-off. Over.
That would be very interesting. Go ahead.
Okay, preliminary analysis of the data indicates that the center S-II engine vibrated at a somewhat higher amplitude than we've seen on previous flights, and it started at about 160 seconds into the S-II burn. As a result of these vibrations, the engine chamber pressure decreased to the level where the two low-level thrust sensors, the thrust-okay sensors, initiated center engine cut-off. Early evaluation of data indicates that no damage occurred to the engine, and the cause of the increased vibration amplitude is still under investigation. Over.
I thought it was the center engine.
Yes, right.
Joe, do you have any word on what marks we had for TLI?
At the time of TLI, as I recall, you had 6 seconds longer than the nominal burn which was 3 seconds longer than the B-sigma low burn, and you were also GO for a second-opportunity TLI if we had required one.
Okay, we were just wondering because it appeared to us that we had a longer TLI burn than had been predicted.
Yes, you did. We confirmed that - that - that cut-off time just about as you saw it, and I don't have an explanation for it, but it was within the B-sigma margin.
13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, we have no further questions. All the answers were clear and satisfactory, and we thank you very much. You can press on with the rest of your busy day.
Right-o.
And, Houston; 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Joe. Out window 5, I just picked up the tumbling object again so, for sure, it must have been a SLA panel. I don't think we could still be in the proximity of the S-IV at this time.
I don't think so, Fred. It's several hundred miles aft of you. 700 miles is - is the number, I'm told. And since the SLA panel didn't make the midcourse correction, that might be it.
Yes, it's, I can't really tell for sure even through the monocular that it is, but it looks the same relative position to the stars. And the best I can tell about the same intensity and still about the same distance from us.
Can you see it tumbling. Does it have a shape, or is it a point?
No. I can tell it's tumbling; I guess the flat side not only is facing me, it's not only much brighter, it also grows larger.
Okay. Very interesting. We'll see if we can figure out where that's relative to you. They keep updating the S-IV impact on us a little bit. The last guess we had was that it will impact about the same longitude we gave you but close to zero latitude and a little bit later. You still won't be able to see it. And they're saying it might make a - -
Roger.
- - they're saying it might make a 100 to 120 foot crater, too.
It'll still be past the terminator for us for awhile.
Right. It will be at about the REV 20 terminator, so it will be late in your lunar orbit activities before you will be able to photograph it, and FAO is looking at whether we can work that in or not.
Okay.
Houston, 13.
13, Houston.
Hey, Joe? Is FAO ready to - do you - or are you ready to give me those items that we made optional and deleted in the solo book?
Jack, we are not quite ready with that yet, but we will be before too long. Can you wait awhile?
Sure can. Got lots of time.
Okay.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Just a passing comment, Joe. We're having lunch right now, and I just made myself a hotdog sandwich with catsup. Very tasty and almost unheard of in the old days.
That's correct, 13. As I recall the flight plan, you're supposed to put mustard on the hot dogs and not catsup, but I guess we'll overlook that.
We blew it.
Right. How's everything going?
It's going pretty good. We have about four different methods of spreading catsup, right now.
Okay. Jack, we'll have your update to you before too long.
Okay. Fine, Joe. We did a pit check on the Hycon camera and everything works okay.
Okay. Beautiful. We don't have anything else for you at the moment.
Houston, 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like to get the FM up now to look at some inside pictures there.
Okay. Stand by and I'll get a GO on this.
13, Houston.
Go ahead.
That's acceptable, Fred, and meanwhile, when you guys are ready to copy, we've got an MCC-2 pad for you.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Roger that. And also if you can go to P00 and ACCEPT conveniently, we'd like to uplink.
Okay. You've got it.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. You can go ahead with the P30 pad.
Okay. Here we go. MCC-2, SPS/G&N: 63634; plus 0.96, minus 0.23; 030:40:49.00; minus 0021.7, minus 0001.7, minus 0008.0; 080, 164, 326; N/A, N/A; 0023.2, 0:03.5 - We'll give you half a second on the burn time because it's so short - 0018.5; 44, 135.9, 28.1; and the rest is N/A. Comments: set stars 31 and 23; roll aline 288, pitch 205, yaw 034; no ullage, LM weight 33499, and over.
Okay. MCC-2, SPS/G&N: 63634; plus 0.96, minus 0.23, 030:40:49.00; minus 0021.7, minus 0001.7, minus 0008.0; 080, 164, 326; N/A, N/A; 0023.2, burn time 0:03.5, 0018.5; 44, 135.9, 28.1; and the rest N/A. Set stars 31, 23; roll aline 288, pitch 205, yaw 034; no ullage, LM weight 33499.
Roger. Readback correct. I have two more short comments on them, but I want to wait just a second and make sure I understand them before I pass them to you.
Okay.
Okay, Fred; Houston.
Go ahead.
The two additional comments were just that, first of all, they biased DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> by minus 0.34 feet per second based on your EMS null bias cheeks. That's just for information. And the second one also for information is that your targeted pericynthion is 60 miles after this correction.
Okay, understand. For Jack's information the EMS DELTA-V bias is 3.4, and our targeted pericynthion after this maneuver is 60 miles.
That's correct on the pericynthion. The EMS bias is 0.34, very small.
Okay. 0.34 on the EMS DELTA-V bias.
Roger. And - -
Hey, Joe, we'll give - -
Go ahead, Jack - -
We'll give you - we'll give you the read - we'll give you the results of another null bias test for comparative purposes right before the - oh, at the proper time.
Okay. Real fine; and the computer is yours.
Okay. Thank you. Going BLOCK.
Okay, Houston; 13. Are you copying the torquing angles on the P52?
Okay, Jack. Give us a second.
And, 13, Houston. We have them. You can torque them.
Okay, Joe. Time of torquing 29 hours 0 minute 30 seconds.
Roger that.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Hey, you've got a new CAPCOM on now with the Black Crew, and we have about three items to give you, Jack.
Okay. Stand by 1. Are these updates or what?
I'm going to give you some high gain antenna angles for TV and the rest is just information, general words.
Go ahead ...
Okay. Burn attitude for TV, your pitch and yaw angles are as follows: PITCH minus 1 - minus 69, YAW 180, HIGH GAIN.
Okay.
Okay. Second point is that you're GO for MCC-2. Everything's looking good here.
Okay. Real fine.
And the last item's for Jack. Jack, the preliminary indications are that you can get a 60-day extension on your - filing your income tax if you're out of the country.
That's good news. I guess I qualify.
Yes, we were just looking at the map, and you're south of Florida so you're not in the country now. But we wondered how about your car tags. Have you taken care of those?
Yes, I did, as a matter of fact. I think I did!
Known as, "plan ahead."
Okay. Good.
And, Apollo 13, Houston. Recommend OMNI Alfa until you get to the burn attitude.
Okay. OMNI Alfa.
Okay, Houston; Apollo 13.
13, go ahead.
Okay, Vance. The EMS DELTA-V pass passive, the results of the no-bias pass in 100 seconds, have been from 100 to 101.5.
Roger. Copy plus 100 to plus 101.5, and that agrees fairly closely with the last one, as I recall.
Okay. Fine.
Okay, Houston. We're at P40 burn attitude. Jim is on the sextant star check, and we do have a star in the sextant.
Roger, Jack. Copy. Very good.
But we couldn't tell you whether it's 44 or not.
Whoops.
Okay, Houston; 13. We're a little bit ahead of ourselves. Do we have a GO to do the fuel cell purge and the waste water dump?
Jack, that's affirm. You have a GO for those.
Okay. We're on our way.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, battery A is charged now. Whenever you want to unhook it will be fine with us.
Okay.
Houston, 13. Are you still planning to have TV at the scheduled time?
Okay, 13; Houston. That's affirm. At the flight-plan-scheduled time.
Okay. All right. We've got a beautiful sight we want to show you.
Right.
13, Houston. You can go ahead with the TV now. We're standing by.
Okay. Here it comes.
Okay.
Okay. Jack. It's coming in, and it's right in the center of our screen.
Okay, Vance.
Can you - Think you could guess what that might be, Vance? Better than Charlie?
I don't want to start flipping coins at this point.
Okay, Vance. We're pointed just a little ways off from looking directly at the Moon. Jim is holding the camera through window 3. The Sun is coming at about 40 degrees off our left side, and what we are going to show you in just a minute is about 30 seconds of waste water dump and just show you just what it looks like. It's really fantastic.
Okay. We'd like to see that.
Okay. We saw some droplets speeding out for a little while, Jack. Now we don't see anything.
Actually, Vance, what you're looking at is solid water droplets coming out just about all the time. It lights up the whole sky around the Moon. It's Just far too fine for you to see. Now I think they're coming out a little thicker.
Okay. Yes, we see those.
Jack's complaining about seeing stars.
FIDO says he can understand why that would perturbate a trajectory now.
It's amazing watching these little frozen droplets maneuver. They seem to go in all directions, but finally after they get out a certain ways, settle down and they all seem to be traveling in the same direction.
Right. That's coming in real well.
The objects in the foreground are parts of the LM that you're looking at.
The camera is now going to ...
We can just barely see those parts of the LM. They must be in a shadow.
Okay. Now you are looking at a thruster quad at the lower part of your screen.
I've got the f-stop all the way open now, Vance; that's quad - quad 1 you're looking at with the LM should - The Moon should be in view just over the top of the quad.
Right. We see the nozzle of the quad, but it's dark and it's not easy to see.
13, Houston. INCO suggests you try AVERAGE if you're in PEAK to see if that gives us a better picture.
Okay. We're in AVERAGE now.
I think that helps out. We can see it better.
Okay. Now, 13, request you either move it away from the bright area or else move it back to PEAK. Over.
Okay, Vance. I cranked the focus down a little bit. Is the quad coming in any better now?
It's coming in about the same, Fred, and you're a little weak now on the COMM.
We could see when you went back to PEAK.
And I'm now ... all the way out.
Okay. We could see you zoom in on the Moon, and it's near the center of our screen, just a little to the left. Very clear.
Yes. I show it just about at 38.
We can't tell if it's gray or light brown, though.
Do you have your grid down there, Vance?
That's negative, Fred.
Okay.
I don't know if you can make out the features there, Vance, on the Moon, but it looks like the terminators are at central plains area somewhere around Descartes, maybe.
Okay. We're - We see it just as a bright portion of the lunar disk, and it looks a lot like you see it from Earth. Very bright. We are unable to see any features at all.
It's pretty much the same with the eyeballs in here, and it looks a little bigger now. But the only way I could see it very good at all was with the monocular, a little while ago.
Okay, Fred. Very good. We'd be interested to seeing the cabin when you get ready for that, too.
Okay. I'll set up now.
And, Vance, we're counting down to midcourse-2, we're up to, in our checklist, to minus 6 minutes to go.
Roger. Minus 6 minutes. Understand you're about ready to turn on the gimbal motors and all that sort of thing. Okay. We see the computer now in the upper middle part of the - the panel. I think we see somebody's checklist in the center couch. It must be Jim holding the checklist.
Right. And what Jim's holding now, he's got a pen in his hand we've rigged on a string, as sort of a simple-minded accelerometer. This burn's pretty short and I'm not sure even that's going to show very much. But we'll see if it'll stretch out at the end of its string.
Yes. We see the pencil at the top of the picture floating around. And Jack's coming into view now.
And I've gone back - Okay, I've gone back to AVERAGE now and ... pitch up.
Roger.
Now in a few minutes, Vance, I guess we'll see how about the only system we haven't used yet works. Everything else sure has worked mighty fine.
Right. The spacecraft's really working nicely. Okay. We're picking up panel 2 now. Still a little bit of the checklist.
Wondering if you can pick up the caution array there?
Right. We just saw your - your testing of the caution and warning system at the left-hand side of the panel on our TV. See the lights all flash on. You're doing it again.
You mission timer's showing up as a - a brilliant green in the upper left-hand part of the picture.
Roger. I got the camera kind of canted on you here, Vance.
Vance, Jim's going to go to VOX now.
Vance, how do you - -
Roger. Read you loud and clear, Jim.
Okay. We'll - what we'll do - We'll be on VOX for the remainder of the burn and preburn countdown.
...
... And what we're waiting for is 54 minutes on our counter or 20 which would be minus - -
Jim, we hear clipping on your VOX. Could you adjust it so that you're coming in continuously all the time?
Okay. Stand by 1.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5. How's that, Vance?
Okay. That's better.
Vance, how do you read the CMP on VOX?
Jack, read you loud and clear.
Okay. Fine.
We show minus 8-1/2 minutes.
Roger. Houston copies.
Close - -
Is that too close, Vance, or can you make out the SPS engine panel now?
We can see your fuel and oxidizer gages and hydrogen/oxygen gages at the top of the picture and the PUGS, but it isn't coming in in focus too well. It's a little dim.
Yes. I think the problem is I'm about 2 feet and it doesn't go down but to 4.
Right. We understand that's the panel right in front of your face.
Okay. Vance, stand by for the main ...
Okay. We're minus 7 minutes.
Roger.
Fred, the focus is good enough that we can see the position of your four ball valves at the top of the picture for the big SPS engine.
What would you like to watch, Vance?
Hopefully, you'll see the - or we'll see the two on the left here, set A, go on here directly - -

BMAGs, RATE 2.
I'm already in low bit rate.
Okay.
Yes, we were on those ... so that we had less than 0.2.
Okay. Houston copied your residuals, very low.
Okay. Fuel is 1.0; oxidizer 0.25; the OX unbalance is reading on the decrease, which doesn't mean very much, and I guess that wasn't too much for a push there, Vance. I didn't see the accelerometer do a whole lot and it was a little surprising how slowly the injector valves opened, at least on the indicators.
Roger. That was a very short burn. Request you give us a sweep across the panel when you get a chance, Fred. Let us see Jack and Jim again. Over.
Okay.
Okay, Vance, I was going to show you on - wonder if the folks might - down there might be interested in how we find out how far we're away from the Moon. Going to do that right now in program 21 here.
Okay.
I'm asking the computer how far away we are. And the computer is telling me we're 121 490 miles out.
Okay. That agrees fairly closely with our map on the wall.
I'm glad. That means you're tracking us too.
And if you didn't see our residuals, it was 0.1 X, 0.2 on Y, and 0.1 Z, and DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 3.8.
Jack, Houston. We show you down here 121 thousand miles 520 out. So I guess we all agree.
Okay. Real good, Vance. What I'm going to do is give you a shot of Fred.
If we can get all the wiring out of the way.
The big problem here is, when you move the TV around, this wire follows you like a snake here.
Yes, we have Fred now. Looks like he has a lariat there, getting ready to rope the checklist.
That's only half of it. We have most of it hidden away. It's been pretty interesting doing all the camera work here to get a little extra training running the TV here, hopefully for when we get on the ground at Fra Mauro. The monitor does make it pretty easy though.
Right. That's a real advantage in the cockpit. You're just a little bit dark. It looks like it might help to have the f-stop run down about one increment. See how it comes out - -
Can't do it, we're wide open.
Are you?
I think we're wide open - -
Yes. We're wide open, Vance.
Okay. Does that help any, Vance?
Okay. It's reasonably good. We can make out Fred fairly well. Looks like he's in a shadow. Hey, that helps. You just turned up the lights, huh?
Yes. We went fixed on the - -
Okay. You're on candid camera.
We did notice one thing, Vance. You know that new fad with long hair? It won't work too well up here in space.
What was that one again?
I say, you know the new - the new fad with long hair?
Right.
It doesn't work too well up in space, you can't comb your hair up here.
Well, I guess you have to give up something.
Well, at least it - it helps to try. We can see you trying to comb your hair there, Jim. It looks like your - your beards haven't come along to the point where you've had to use the razor though.
Well, we've been debating that. We thought we'd take care of our beards tomorrow and make that one of our daily routines.
I take it that was a subtle hint, Vance.
No, no. We're not commenting on your appearance, Fred. I mean nothing derogatory, understand.
And, Vance, thought we'd get a picture of Jack just so that all the girls know that he's still here.
(Laughter)
...
Yes, we - we appreciate that. There he is. Big Jack.
Jack, you're in the shadow right now; we have a little bit of interference from your window, which is very bright, so we can't - I think you're smiling, but it's a little hard to tell.
...
Hey, there we go. Incidentally, we've been getting all kinds of bits of information to pass up to you. We've had baseball scores coming in, basketball. Somebody said there's 220 days, shopping days left until Christmas.
Yes. Who won the Masters, Vance?
It was a tie in the Masters and stand by. It was a tie between Littler and Casper after 72 holes, and there is going to be a playoff Monday, we understand.
Oh. Sounds good.
One thing the world might be interested in knowing is what you do after the burn in the way of configuring switches back. We - We heard you go through the checklist. But, I guess right now, basically, you probably have all the switches back in position and you're in the mode to continue on with - Okay. What does the flight plans say? You're going to be doing cislunar navigation. So, Jack you're going to be down in the LEB. Is that correct?
That's right, Vance. Be going down there shortly.
Okay. The TV now is all but black. Looks like it must be pointing into a shadow.
What he's doing, he's trying to give you one more shot of the Moon, and right now I'm setting to maneuver pad and the optics calibration attitude.
Roger.
And what I wanted to point out, I don't know if it's apparent, but ... to show the advantage of doing all the dumps just before the burn, we're looking again at the same scene over quad 1 at the Moon. And now you don't see all the sparkly frozen particles outside there any more. We've sort of run off and left them.
Roger. We - We don't see anything out there anymore in the way of particles leaving the spacecraft. We'd suggest, maybe you zoom the Moon in a little bit again so we can see the shape of it better.
Okay. That brings the Moon in. We can see the terminator at the top of the melon-shaped disk.
Okay. Now you can see a few of the spark - sparkling particles going across the screen. Those are being emitted from the thrusters. Jack's maneuvering the spacecraft now.
Okay. We can see those very poorly. Well, actually, they are coming in better now. It looks like little specks going from the upper left part of the screen across to the right, and understand those are from the thrusters.
That's affirm.
Okay, 13; Houston. Just as an item of interest, advise your speed with respect to the Earth is now 4667 feet per second.
Okay. Thanks, Vance.
Okay, Apollo 13; Houston. The Moon has been in and out of the - the - our screen here. Right now it's off at the bottom side, but we can still see the particles coming off of the spacecraft.
Okay. I am going to have to pull it out the window now, Vance. The Sun's coming up on the right side.
Roger. Understand. You - -
Do you want to see any shots down in the LEB, Vance?
Say again.
Do you want to see any of the photographs or do you want the TV down in the LEB?
That's right, Jim. It would be good to see what you are doing down in the LEB or the far corner of the spacecraft where the optics are. Might be interesting to describe what you will do in the next few minutes in the way of sighting.
Okay, Vance. First we are going to give you a shot of the sleep station.
Okay. The camera's bounced around a little, but we can see the green computer come in every once in a while.
While Jack is getting the sleep station rolled up, I thought I would show you one interesting corner. We've got a temporary stowage bag here and that's where all our wastepaper and all that goes while we're - after every meal. It's in the right-hand corner down by our dump system.
Roger. Understand. We're looking at the wastebasket.
And the age-old question that is always asked us is how do we get rid of liquid waste and that line that you see, I think you can see it now, it goes right outside where we open up the overboard drain dump, and all of our waste products, liquid waste products, go out through that line and get dumped overboard.
Roger. Understand, and we can see somebody's foot, as well.
Okay. Fred is now going down there, and he is going to try to get underneath the sleep station on his side where we have a sleep restraint. And the whole object of that is to ... to position the body between the - between the bottom of the spacecraft and - so it doesn't float up between that and the bottom of the couch.
Roger. The sleep restraint of the hammock is coming into view underneath the couch. It's the white object.
You perhaps can see the zipper of the hammock right now. It's the black lines in that white object.
Right. We can see it.
These hammocks, by the way, are very comfortable. When we first heard about them in the design of Apollo, we thought they weren't necessary, but they turned out to be very nice devices to sleep in.
I'm trying now to get down there with Fred to show you how it works. I keep floating up, though, but maybe we can get a little shot here.
Okay. We have somebody upside down in the photograph now. Realizing, of course, in - in space there is no really rightside up or upside down. It still looks that way to us.
Okay. That's - That's Fred now. I'm trying to put him rightside up, for you folks back there in the sleep station. Fred, would you move your hands there so the folks back home can see you?
Okay. That's coming in real clear, Jim. We see Fred in the sleep restaint - restraint.
As a matter of fact, Vance, I find my - I find Fred down there all the time.
Yes. I can see he appreciates that. Looks fairly comfortable.
Looks like there is a lot of room down there, considering all the boxes on the floor and underneath the couch.
It's surprising. There still is quite a bit of room down there even with the Hycon camera box down. And now, I'm going to bring the camera back up.
Okay, Vance. If there is no more that you would like to see right now, we'll terminate our little TV for you today.
Okay. Thank you very much, Jim. Appreciated seeing inside the spacecraft and getting a look at the Moon that you're rapidly approaching.
Roger. This is Odyssey saying goodby.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. At your convenience we have an item to give you which will have to be copied. It's information on how to photograph Comet Bennett at time 32 hours GET. Over.
Okay. Stand by 1 minute.
Okay.
Okay, Vance. Go ahead.
Okay. Time 32 hours 00 minutes GET. Instructions at completion of P23, maneuver to following attitude: roll 101.0, pitch 090.0, yaw 000.0. High gain antenna angles will be: pitch minus 23, yaw 93. Use normal PTC procedures to dampen rates. After vehicle's stable, and before spinup, take photographs of Comet Bennett. Use the DAC on the sextant with magazine G. That is, very high-speed black-and-white film, right? That's the dim-light film. Take three photos, one each at 5-, 20-, and 60-seconds' time exposure. Use AUTO optics. NOUN 88 values are R<sub>1</sub> plus 34717, R<sub>2</sub> minus 08028; R<sub>3</sub> plus 35075. Take three photos one each at 5-, 20-, and 60-second time exposure using manual optics. Shaft will be 000.8 degrees, trunnion 12.5 degrees. Comment: Strip off about 50 frames; that is, 2 seconds of - at 24 feet per second before the first frame and after the last frame of the photos. That is, 2 second - 2 seconds at 24 frames per second - before the first frame and after the last frame of photos.
Is that it, Vance?
And that's all.
Okay. The time is - The event will be at 32:00; and we're to maneuver to the following attitude; roll 101.0, pitch 090.0, yaw all zips. High gain angles will be pitch minus 23, yaw 93. And we're to use normal PTC procedures to damp the rates. And after damping the rates and before spinup, we're to put the DAC on the sextant with the magazine G, very high-speed black and white film. Then, we're to take three photos, one each at 5-, 20-, and 60-seconds' time exposure using audio - AUTO optics. Our NOUN 88 values R<sub>1</sub> plus 34717, R<sub>2</sub> minus 08028, R<sub>3</sub> plus 35075. Thence, three more photos, one each at 5-, 20-, 60-seconds' time exposure using manual optics. Shaft 0.8 degrees, trunnion 12.5 degrees. And we're to take 2 - second bursts at 24 frames per second, before and after these pictures.
Your readback is correct, Fred.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, for PTC tonight, request that you disable quads C and D. That's the opposite of last night. Over.
Okay. For PTC tonight, disable quads C and D.
Roger. And advise in approximately an hour, we'll have some read-ups whenever you're ready to take them regarding solo book changes.
Okay. We'll be standing by for it.
Roger.
Houston, 13.
Go ahead, 13.
Have you all got a chance to look at the data on the SPS yet?
Stand by 1, Fred.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Fred, it looks good, but they haven't had a chance to evaluate everything. They'll probably be finished with looking at strip charts in about 15 minutes, and after that we'll try to get back with you.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
On the P33, just like to verify that you changed the NOUN 88 values for this last star. It looks like they haven't been changed. Over.
Okay, Vance.
That's better. Let's read you what we - what we have. We have what they had in the flight plan, and if it's been changed from the flight plan, we don't have it.
Stand by 1.
We think you're right, Vance. It looks like they used the same set of NOUN 88 for both stars by mistake.
Okay, very good.
Okay, Vance. That ought to complete the P23s, right?
Okay. Very good, Jack.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
We have some results on your - your first star, if you'd like to hear them. The rest of the stars we'll - we'll have to give you in a couple of hours. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, the first star: the corrected altitude, 15 kilometers plus or minus 4; effective altitude, 12 kilometers plus or minus 7. As far as the substellar point, the value is arc-minutes - 2 arc-minutes, and that's very good. And, like I said, we'll get back with you in a couple of hours for the rest.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Okay. We have several items, here. First, is a reminder on the PTC that R<sub>1</sub> should be 375 - 0.375 degrees as last night, to get 0.3-degree rotation rate. The second one - -
Okay. Copy that.
Okay. The second one, at 32 hours looking at Bennett's Comet - we want the pictures taken when the spacecraft is as stable as it's going to be before starting PTC. The stability requirement is very high. We weren't sure if you understood that from what we passed up. In addition, the photographs might not show as much as the eye can see of the comet, so if you see anything interesting about the structure of the comet, why, sketching it is in order and is encouraged. Over.
Okay, Vance. What we'll do is, when we get to attitude, we'll disable the quads and do like we did last night; we'll let GUIDO and you people down there tell us when you think we are stable enough; then we'll do all this work with the DAC on the sextant, first; and then when we get that done, we'll go back and put the sextant eyepiece back on and see what we can observe visually.
Okay. That sounds good. Also, while you are waiting for the vehicle to stabilize, it might be interesting to have the eyepiece on and be looking at it visually. Okay. Next item: your SPS burn had no anomalies whatsoever. It was a very good burn.
Okay. Very good.
Next item: request hydrogen tank 1 HEATER OFF for balancing purposes.
And Apollo 13, another item: something that we have observed and you might be seeing is a slight TCE fluctuation on fuel cell 3. This fluctuation has been going from about 152 to 160 over a 37-second period. It has been seen on other flights in the past. No one is worried about it, but the usual fluctuation is about 1-1/2 degrees instead of 7 seconds, so I thought you should be aware of it.
Okay, Vance. And one other slight distinction we've noted is the flow of hydrogen versus the oxygen is not exactly matched on fuel cell 3 either.
Okay. We copy. And the last item: we'd like to send you an IRIG update, so at your convenience, request P00 and ACCEPT.
Okay. We are in P00 and ACCEPT, Vance.
Okay.
Quad C and D are disabled, Vance.
Roger. Disabled. And down here, we see that your hydrogen and oxygen on the fuel cell are exactly matched, so we suspect it's purely a spacecraft read-out problem.
Okay.
Okay, Vance, let us know when you're through with the DSKY so we can load NOUN 88?
Roger. We'll let you know, Jack.
Apollo 13, Houston. The computer's yours, again.
Okay. You're go for the pictures.
Okay, Vance. We tried our AUTO OPTICS and couldn't pick it up there. We're pointing pretty much right into the Sun, and things are pretty well washed out. And I've gone to MANUAL OPTICS and I'm trying to get 0.8, 12.5 on the shaft and trunnion, and I still can't pick it up. So - it's very light in the sextant, so I kind of think maybe we're too near the Sun to see it.
That's right, Vance. The sextant is all - it's - it's all milky and it - any comet that could be seen through there is just going to be missed in the background.
Okay, we copy that. We got some discussion. Stand by.
Okay, Vance, it isn't - we're not looking into the Sun - what we are getting is a large reflection from the Sun behind us off the LM; and it is - it is coming on that quad 1 there, and that quad is reflecting back into the sextant.
Okay, Jack. Understand. Just a question: if you look through the telescope, can you see the comet at all? Over.
No, I can't, Vance. It's - it's still too light.
Stand by.
Say, Vance?
Roger. Go ahead.
Are the flowers blooming yet?
Gee, I sure haven't seen any.
Okay.
Hey, we've - we've got quite a discussion down here on your trying to observe the comet, and this reflection is not unexpected. And give us another minute, and we'll be back with you on something on that.
Okay. I doubt very seriously though, if we take any photographs with high-speed black and white with the light coming into the sextant that you're going to get anything out of it.
Okay. Unanimous opinion is that you're right, and we'll scratch all of this Bennett Comet stuff on the way out, with the hope that conditions will be more favorable after TEI. Over.
Sounds good. Without the LM, we may have a better chance.
Roger.
And Apollo 13, you're GO for PTC. Your rates are very low according to what we can read.
Roger, Vance.
Okay. Are you going to give a call on OMNI B, Vance?
Do you read, Vance?
Roger. Go ahead. Request OMNI B, Fred, and secure the high-gain antenna.
Okay. You got it.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Just something to think about. In about 30 minutes, we can generate the pads that we have yet to send up before the sleep period, so we could support an earlier sleep period if you so desired. And - but, it will take us 30 minutes to get that stuff. The other thing is any time you're ready to copy, I can read up the solo book changes. Over - And, also, two pages in the flight plan.
Okay, Vance. We're about ready to copy the solo book changes and the flight plan changes, and whenever your pads are ready, we'll take those. And as far as moving up the sleep period, that's fine, but we'll - if we don't go to sleep right away, we'll use it to get out some of our lunar maps and study them.
Okay. And we'll get busy getting those pads for you as soon as possible then, and I'll stand by on the copying bit.
Okay, Vance, I'm ready to copy the solo book changes there.
Okay. First, turn to page 12. On the right-hand side of the page, starting from the middle of the page down, everything under "Cycle 5 frames, Replace dark side or dark slide" should be deleted until you get to the very bottom of the page where you have "Acquisition MSFN OMNI D" and that should remain in. Also, leave in "Remove window shades," which is about the third line down from where you start.
Okay. Okay. Then from "Cycle 5 frames, Replace dark slide," from there on down, delete.
That's everything from there on down, with the exception of "Remove window shades" and at the bottom "Acquisition MSFN OMNI D."
Okay. Copy.
And that includes in the margin to the left, the "DAP load" that's at the very start there and the "0.0507" and "plus 0500," farther down.
Okay. Got it.
Okay. Going to page 13.
Okay.
Okay, in the left margin, just below 105 hours GET, cross out the "0507" and the "plus 0500," and below that, add in "DAP load" as follows: "10111 and 11111."
Okay. Got it.
Okay. Now, next, at about 105:05, there's a "VERB 48." That should be moved up to 105, and below that, the "VERB 49 maneuver" should be moved up, too.
Okay. That "VERB 48" should be moved up to 105:05 and also the "VERB 49."
That should be moved up to 105:00. I'm sorry. Both.
Okay.
And what that does is give you more time to maneuver.
Okay. Next.
All right.
Page 14, right-hand side, near the bottom under "Orbital Science," scratch out "Verify DSE ON," and also delete "Visual target 3 on track 180 plus 19," and cross out the penned-in "D5."
Okay. Got it.
Next, page 15, left-hand column, or left-hand side, rather, near the bottom, where it says "Configure cameras and tape" and goes down through "Replace dark slide." Just make the comment there, "Solar corona is optional." Over.
Okay. Got it.
Okay, next page, 16. This is a continuation of the same solar-corona thing. On the right-hand side of the page, starting just above 107:40 with "VERB 49, maneuver to solar-corona attitude," from there on down to 107:55 just beneath "Replace dark slide," all of this is in an optional category. So you just might line off - -
All right. Got it.
- - that and put "Optional, solar corona." Okay, next, page 17 - -
Okay.
- - starting at 108:00 on the left-hand side, line out "Stop ORB rate at ORB science attitude." At - Line out in the left-hand column the DAP load of "10101" and "11111." Going down to 108:10, add in the following: "Stop ORB rate at track attitude," and, in parentheses, "0, 353, 0." In the left-hand - -
Okay.
Okay, in the left-hand column under 108:10, put in a DAP load in parentheses of "10101" and, under that, "11111."
Okay.
Beneath that, scratch out "Spacecraft control dash CMC AUTO verify." Scratch out the "VERB 79" and all in parentheses after that, like the "Minus 00507," et cetera. And beneath that, scratch out "PRO to start pitch rate." In parentheses, "0, 230 slash 018, 0."
Okay.
Okay. Looking to the right, the LM attitude or rather the CSM attitude will be incorrect, so you can cross that off. And beneath the picture of the moon, cross out the - in parentheses, "108.19" and the "0 230/018, 0"
All right.
On the right-hand half of the page, cross out the "Orbital science block," and under that "Visual target 1 south of track TR." And under that, the penned-in "D2/3/4."
All right. Got it.
And beneath that, cross out "VERB 49, maneuver to track attitude" by the "'C' 0, 353, 0" and the "HU,SCF."
All right.
Okay. The information beneath that starting with "Configure camera earthshine photos" down through "Replace dark slides" is optional. So just put in "Earthshine optional" as a comment there, and in the camera settings, in the block that has "f:2.8 125, infinity," cross out the "125" and put in "one-eighth," 1 slash 8, in other words.
Okay, that last part was, cross out the "125" and put in "1/8." Is that right?
That's affirm. Okay. Next page. No change. Go to page 19.
Okay.
Okay. On the right-hand side, from the "VERB 49, maneuver to earthshine attitude," down through everything up to "MSFN uplink," this is optional. This is "Earthshine optional."
All right. Got it.
And once again, a camera-setting correction up near the top of that section that we called optional, where you have "bracket MIR f:0.9, 125," cross out the "125" and put in "1 slash 60." In other words, one-sixtieth. Over.
Okay. Cross out the "125" and put in "1 slash 60."
That's correct. And further down at 109:50, where you have "Visual target 17," et cetera, cross out that line and cross out the penned-in "D17."
Okay.
Now, move to page 25.
Okay, go ahead, Vance.
Okay. At about 114:10, everything under "Altitude set equals 60 miles" should have the comment "Solar corona, optional," and on that first line of that optional where it says "VERB 49, maneuver to solar corona and limb brightening attitude," cross out "And limb brightening attitude."
Okay.
Going further down to 114:16, cross out the "14 DAC 18 VHBW limb brightening" line and the line under that which is "BRKT, MIR," et cetera.
All right.
In the block where it says "Solar corona and limb brightening photos," cross out "And limb brightening photos" and just put "Solar corona, optional."
Okay. Got it.
Going a few lines below that where you see "DAC ON for 4 seconds at about 50 frame rate cover lens," cross that out.
Hey, Vance, we lost you there, or did you ...?
Yes, I think we lost lock. We'll stand by a minute.
Okay, I got you back.
Okay. Going on down, cross out "114:29:16, DAC ON, SR dash 40 seconds."
Okay.
And at the very bottom line on that half of the page should be crossed out which is "114:29:56, DAC OFF, SR."
Okay.
On the right-hand side of page 25, where you have the title "Solar corona and limb brightening photography," cross out "limb brightening photography."
Okay.
And in the figure, where you have the "DAC LOS" line, which is parallel to the X-axis on the horizon, cross out "DAC LOS" parallel to X-axis on horizon.
All right.
And cross out the bottom block on that half of the page which is "DAC magazine percent required 12 magazines, g," et cetera.
All right.
Next page, 26.
Go ahead.
Okay. Cross out the top line on the right-hand side of that page, which is "DAC on for 4 seconds, 50 frame rate cover lens." And cross out the block to the right of that and down, which has "Magazine percent."
All right. Got it.
Okay. Next, page 28.
Ready to go?
Go ahead.
Okay. On the left-hand side of page 28, at the very bottom, cross out "Photo target 5 north, frame f:5.6, 215, infinity," et cetera. All of that line over to the vertical strip. And cross out the penned-in "E4" below that.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, and the next page, 29, right-hand side near the top, cross out "Photo target 13, north at 5.6, 250," et cetera, all of that line. And cross out beneath that the penned-in "E5 slash 6."
All right.
Going to page 30, next, left-hand side.
Go ahead.
At the top at 127:01, cross out "Visual target 9 on track, 180 degrees, plus 0.47," and cross out the penned-in "E11" beneath that.
Okay.
Going down to 127:11, cross out "Verify DSE ON." Beneath that a ways, cross out "127:14:20, start visual observations of Fra Mauro."
All right.
Beneath that, cross out "Continue visual observations," and cross out "Stop observations." And beneath that, cross out "Photo target 56 on track f:8, 250, infinity, 5," et cetera, to the end of that line. Cross out the "5.6" beneath that and the penned-in "E15."
Okay.
Over in the margin, to the left of all that, make a comment: "Delete visual only."
Where was that, Vance? I didn't get that last one.
Okay. That's still on page 30, on the left-hand side. In the time - in the margin at the left where you have times, just pen in beneath the "127:10" the following: "Delete visual only." That's only a comment.
Okay. All right.
Okay. Going to page 34.
Okay.
About - on the left-hand side about almost halfway down beneath the "VERB 49, maneuver to TOPO target 54A," make the comment "Target 54A is optional."
All right. Got it.
And, next, page 35, on the right-hand side. Everything from "Spacecraft control, CMC, AUTO, verify" on down should be given the comment "Zodiacal light photos optional."
All right.
And, well, where you have the block in the middle of the page that says - the small block that says "Zodiacal light photos," just put "Optional" in that title, too.
Okay.
And, next, page 36, on the left-hand side.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay. First a comment. In the middle of the page is where the zodiacal light stuff ends, just under VERB 48. And then, if you'll go down to the bottom of the page, cross out the line "Photo target 12 on track," et cetera, and cross out the "E5" that is below that line.
Okay, Vance, can I break in a minute?
Sure.
We have the CRYO PRESSURE light on now. The H<sub>2</sub> has hit its lower bound, so do you want us to go back to AUTO on the H<sub>2</sub> HEATER 1?
Stand by.
13, Houston.
All right, go ahead.
They request that you leave that switch in the AUTO position until you go to bed tonight. Stand by. I mean in the ON position. I'll repeat that again. In the OFF position until you go to bed tonight for reasons that you have a 3-percent imbalance, and they'd like to get that more even. So, just before turning in, we'll change the switch to AUTO.
Okay.
Okay, Vance, continue.
Okay - -
Before we get away, would you ask FAO - something I didn't get briefed on - what the penned-in E5 and those letters and numbers mean?
Okay. Just 1 minute.
Okay, we'll have comments on that for you in just a second.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Okay, Vance, I'm ready to continue. I'm ready. Go ahead.
Okay, new subject. Like to break in to say that request you re-initialize the PTT - PTC. For some reason, it's gone up to 18 degrees in pitch and yaw both. We don't quite understand this. All we can think of is - start it again. Over.
Okay. We'll go back.
Okay. We are at the - the end of the changes in the solo book, and I have two pages of changes in the flight plan. Those are pages 3-122 and 3-125. While you're looking that up, we'll put Ken on to answer your question.
Okay. I'll start back - let me start back re-initializing PTC here.
Okay.
Okay, Vance, I'm on 3-122 of the flight plan.
Okay. Okay, about - at time 156:50 on the right - well, on the right-hand half of the page, there's a line which states "Visual target 16, south, 180 plus 1:11, Gassendi, f:15." Request you cross out that line.
Okay, we'll cross them out.
That's all on 3-122. Next change is 3-125.
Okay, I'm looking at 125.
Okay, starting from the top of the page, cross out the first five lines, which are "Set up camera for contamination and photography, Betelgeuse, CM4/EL/80," et cetera, "MAG T," et cetera, "Install window shades."
I've got them crossed.
Okay, then jump down to just about 159:28. Cross out "Maneuver to contamination field photography attitude," and all other lines below that through "Enable thrusters A3, C4, B3," et cetera.
Okay, so we start with "Maneuver to contamination field photography," and we cross out everything down to and including "Enable thrusters A3, C4, B3, and D4."
That's correct. And those are all of the flight changes - flight plan changes we have. And Ken is coming on now and later sometime when we get PTC squared away, and it's convenient, I suppose you should read all these things back to make sure that we're squared away on them.
Okay. Go ahead, TK.
Yes, sir. Understand you have a question.
Yes. I guess I didn't understand what the letter and the number was behind some of these photo targets.
Okay - -
Does that refer to the pages?
Yes, sir. That's the map. Each fold is lettered in the lower - or upper right-hand corner if you work your way from east to west and the charts are labeled D, E, and F and the solo stuff will all be the D and E, and they change with the plane change 1. That's the time they change the two maps.
Okay. I got it. Thank you.
Yes, sir. You're doing good work, hey.
Well, I had a good prime crewman that taught me all I know.
Don't run out.
Hey, when FIDO gets a good hack on our trajectory, will you let us know?
How long you willing to wait?
He's looking at his calendar, if that means anything.
(Laughter) All right.
Okay. I'm back at the attitude here, and I'll wait for rates to damps and you let me know when we're stable again.
Okay. Will do.
13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Roger. Just a reminder you have to disable Charlie and Delta here as you've done in the past. Over.
Okay. I was kind of holding off on this. We're dumping a little waste water now.
Okay. FIDO says he knew it all along. He's - he says he's been very concerned that you've been doing a lot of water dumping.
Okay, Vance. We've got quad C and B disabled.
Okay. Copy, Jack.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
It may be awhile before your rates are settled down. We're still observing fairly high rates and deadbanding. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
(Music)
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. We've got about three items. First one is, all of your P23 batch - two marks have been evaluated and - Hey, congratulations. Looks real good; they're very happy with it. You're down to 4 arc-minutes on the substellar-point aspect of it, and that's the first thing to mention. The second is, unless you see a need, I don't see any need for you to read back the information we gave you on the solo book and so forth. Do you concur?
Roger. I think I got it. I remembered a lot of it, and so I think with what you gave me and what I remember, I'm pretty sure we got it right.
Okay, and the third item, I was just about to call that your rates were stabilized to start the PTC, but it looks like they're jiggling around again from a dump, so we'll stand by some more.
Okay.
No secrets around here.
Say again. Hey, that's right.
I said there's no secrets around here.
Yes. Big Brother is watching.
13 - -
I can just see EECOM telling FIDO.
Yes. You really have to watch that pair, all right. By the way, we have a maneuver pad for you, a fly-by pad, whenever you're ready to copy.
Okay. Stand by.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay, maneuver pad, purpose: fly-by, SPS/G&N; 63385; plus 0.97, minus 0.23; 072:24:33.08; plus 0212.7, minus 0141.7, minus 0254.8; 148, 316, 050; NA, plus 0022.5; 0360.9, 0:53, 0356.3; 33, 352.7, 15.0; NA, NA, NA. Starting with latitude, minus 23.26, minus 165.00; 1147.7, 36172; 166:54:02. Comments, GDC aline stars are 31, Arcturus; and 23, Denebola. R aline 288, pitch aline 205, yaw aline 034; ullage, none; other, burn is SPS docked. LM weight, 33499. Over.
Our pad as follows: fly-by, SPS/G&N; 63385; plus 0.97, minus 0.23; 072:24:33.08; plus 0212.7, minus 0141.7, minus 0254.8; 148, 316, 050; NA, plus 0022.5; 0360.9, 0:53, 0356.3; 33, 352.7, 15.0; NA, NA, NA; minus 23.26, minus 165.00; 1147.7, 36172; 166:54:02; set stars 31, 23; roll is 288, pitch 205, yaw 034; no ullage; SPS docked; and LM weight, 33499.
Roger. That's correct. Want to verify under NOUN 81 that DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> is plus 02127. You cut out right there.
Roger. DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> is 02127.
Roger. And your rates are low. Looks like you can start the PTC.
Okay. In work.
Okay. And when the computer is available, request P00 and ACCEPT and we'll ship you your state vector.
Wait until I get PTC going first, Vance, then we'll give it to you.
Okay.
Okay, Vance. We're P00 and ACCEPT. The computer's yours.
Roger. Here it comes.
You know, somehow, everytime I do a set of P23s, you guys uplink me a state vector. I don't think I do too well.
No - -
I could get a complex.
No. You know - you know how the FIDOs are. They like to load in their own data, no matter what.
But our state vectors take into account the waste water dumps.
Yes, that's -
Apollo 13, Houston. It's your computer again.
Okay. Going to BLOCK.
And as a matter of interest, understand that the downrange comparison between the MCC and the computer is within 35000 feet, and that's on the last sighting, which people think is pretty good.
Okay. Maybe that gives us a little more confidence that if we had to do P23s on the way home, we'd make it.
No doubt about it.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Just info on your PTC, Jim. It's looking very good. Just - excursions in pitch and yaw are very low.
Okay, thank you. And we're going to change another lithium hydroxide canister now.
Okay.
And, Vance. Has FIDO come up with any observations on the trajectory?
Well, a minute ago, he said that to tell you that he was pacified now after your past comments on his trajectory and so forth, and he hadn't seen any waste water dumps or anything and he's pretty happy.
Okay. I just wondered if we're going to need any more midcourse.
He says, seriously, it's looking probably like you won't have any more.
Hey, that's real fine.
FIDOs never guarantee anything, however.
Yes. That's right.
Houston, 13. I have the onboard read-out, if you're ready to copy.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. BAT C 37, PYRO BAT A 37, PYRO BAT B 37, RCS A 97 percent, B 97 percent, C 96 percent, D 97 percent.
Roger. We copy that. Thank you.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Jim, just an item for you and Fred to be thinking about in case you haven't been briefed on this, something that's now being talked about a little bit. These conservative people would like to have you read the SHe tank pressure when you go into the LM for the LM familiarization at 58 hours. If there's no midcourse-3, and it looks like there's a good chance that there will not be, why, they might want to move the LM familiarization up from 58 to 55 hours. Over.
Okay. If we don't have a midcourse-3, then we'll probably move LM FAM up to 55 hours, in which case we'll go in there and read SHe tank pressure.
Roger. Along with the other FAM stuff, and it's not certain that we want to do this, it's just being talked about, so this is just the information for you.
Okay. This is beginning to sound like the SIM that we ran not too long ago.
I don't think it will be a very big deal.
Okay. Houston, 13.
This is Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Vance. Our LM/CM DELTA-P is 0.9.
Roger. 0.9.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Are you guys hacking into your presleep checklist yet?
Oh, we just finished eating and cleaning up a bit afterwards. Jim's going around collecting debris off of all the inlet hoses. And, I guess you might say we're kind of thinking about getting ready to go to sleep.
Well, I hope you had a good meal.
It wasn't too bad.
(Music)
Sounds like you guys are really living it up up there. All that music, food. I didn't say drink.
Yes, it is pretty nice. Not bad at all. You're right; you didn't say it. This PTC we're in is a pretty - pretty nice merry-go-round, Vance. Every 10 minutes alternately I get to look at the Earth and the Moon.
You couldn't ask for anything more than that. Just so it isn't so fast you - -
No, it's a lot - a lot better. I remember from 8 when they didn't hardly ever get to look at either one.
That's right. They were tumbling about another axis, weren't they.
Yes.
It's pretty cloudy down there tonight. About the only land I can see again is a portion of Australia and Korea and looks like a part of China. Just about clouds covering everything else.
Can you still see that clearly with the naked eye, or do you have to look through a glass?
I can see Australia with the naked eye and the China landmass, but I - It took the monocular to pull out the Korean Peninsula.
How about the Moon? Is it looking very big yet?
No, not really. Bigger, but we've got a ways to go.
I understand that they're estimating your pericynthion - lunar pericynthion is now 62 miles.
Well, that's not bad.
That's supposed to be just right.
Yes.
Okay, Houston; 13.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. We're into the presleep checklist now. As far as the crew status report, as far as medication goes, we've had no medication. And we're all feeling really good. I've given you the onboard readouts. Jim is chlorinating the potable water now. I'm ready for an E-memory dump whenever you're ready.
Stand by 1 on the E-memory dump, Jack. I think we'll be ready in about a minute.
Okay.
And EECOM says that as soon as you stir your cryos, request you go back to AUTO on that one tank.
Okay. We'll do that.
Hello, 13; Houston. We're ready to take your E-memory dump.
Okay. Coming down.
Apollo 13, Houston. Were you trying to call?
Go ahead, Houston.
Houston, 13.
Apollo 13, Houston. We thought you were trying to call. Were you?
I don't believe so unless we inadvertently hit the microphone button.
Must have been some other guy trying to call, Jack.
Just trying to get some words in, eh Jack?
Roger. We saw the downvoice subperiod come on. We thought maybe you were trying to call. Sorry. I hope we haven't disturbed you and from where I sit, it looks like you're running a rest home up there. Good night.
We're all going to bed now just after we play the last rendition of "With Our Eyes on the Stars."
(Music)
Okay, Jim. And we'd like you to check your S-BAND NORMAL voice switch, OFF.
S-BAND NORMAL, OFF.
Houston, 13. We'll be off COMM; so if you need us, send a crew alert, please.
Okay, Jim. If we need you, we'll send a crew alert, and we'd like to know who's got the duty tonight on the BIOMED. Is that you?
Yes. I'll be on the BIOMED.
Okay. We copy, and you're spoiling my good record of two watches without saying anything.
Just want to keep you busy, Jack.
You're waking me up.
Houston, Houston, Apollo 13. Over.
Good morning, 13. You're early.
Ah so. I just thought I'd be waking up. And we are awake and getting the spacecraft shipshape. ...
Roger. Spacecraft is in real good shape as far as we're concerned, Jim. We're bored to tears down here. We do have a few little items for you, like a P37 update and a couple of flight plan updates. But there's no rush about them. Over.
Okay. Gig us again in a few minutes. We're breaking out some food, and we'll copy them then.
Okay. And the surgeon will be ready for your sleep report whenever you get that together.
Righto. If he's listening, LMP had a solid 9 hours of sleep; I couldn't wake him up this morning. The CMP had 6 hours, and the commander about 5 intermittent.
Okay - -
Jack's dosimeter - Jack's dosimeter is reading 02026.
Okay. We got it.
It might be interesting that just after we went to sleep last night we had a MASTER ALARM and it really scared us. And we were all over the cockpit like a wet noodle.
(Laughter) Sorry it wasn't something more significant. I've also got a procedure for you on that H<sub>2</sub> tank; simple thing after you get done stirring up the cryos.
Okay.
(Music - With Their Eyes on the Stars)
That was beautiful. What was it?
A little of "With Their Eyes on the Stars" to wake up to.
Sounds like all the comforts of home. Have you guys got a flower on your breakfast table?
Yes. Jack!
Houston, Apollo 13. Over.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
13, this is Houston. Go.
Roger, Joe. We're standing by for that P37 block data if you have it for us.
Okay. Got it right here, Jim, and it follows. This is the P37 pad for lift-off plus 60. The reason for the update is for weather avoidance in the MPL at 119 hours. It's the same one we passed you yesterday, and it's the same weather, but we still don't expect a problem at the end of the mission. GETI is 060:00, DELTA-V<sub>T</sub> 6079, longitude minus 153, GET 400K 118:04. Over.
GETI of 060:00, 6079, minus 153, 118:04.
Roger. That's correct. I've got a consumables update for you, Jim, if you're ready for that.
Ready to copy.
Okay. As of 47 hours, RCS total 1096, quad Alfa 270, Bravo 278, Charlie 270, Delta 278, and the H<sub>2</sub> - - They gave me the H<sub>2</sub>s in percent, 76 percent; and on the O<sub>2</sub> we have 81 percent. However, we show the O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 reading off-scale high now. We're quite sure it's a sensor failure. We'd like you to verify it with your onboard reading.
Okay. Stand by.
Joe, we confirm. Our gage reading is - on the number 2 O<sub>2</sub> tank is reading off-scale high now, but Jack just tells me that it was okay when we first looked at it this morning.
We verify that. At 46:45 we had 82 percent and apparently when he stirred the, the cryos, the sensor broke.
Okay.
So it's no problem. You're above nominal on all your consumables. On the H<sub>2</sub> tank problem, we have a procedure that we'd like you to carry out which is simply turning the H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters to OFF at this time, and we want to see whether that won't solve the problem of the tank pressure setting off caution and warning. We want to look at it that way for a few hours.
Okay. You want both H<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters to OFF. Is that correct?
That's negative; just tank 2. We want tank 1 to stay in AUTO.
Okay. Tank 2 heaters off at this time.
Okay. Good deal. That's been the high tank and apparently while waiting for that pressure switch to close, to start the heater cycle, the tank 1 pressure has been dropping even a little bit lower and just setting off caution and warning, so we feel if we turn off the tank 2 heater and let tank 1 activate the heater cycle, we won't get into the caution and warning range.
Roger.
Okay, Jim. At your convenience we'd like P00 and ACCEPT. We're ready for - to uplink your state vector now since we will not do midcourse 3. Over.
Roger. You're in P00 and ACCEPT, no midcourse 3, and we're all set for a state vector update and I'm giving you the LM/CM DELTA-P here shortly.
Okay. Good deal. And I have flight plan updates for you later, at your convenience.
Houston, Apollo 13. The LM/CM DELTA-P is 1.0 psi.
Copy, 1.0, Jim.
Houston, Apollo 13. I'm about ready for any flight plan updates that you have.
Okay, 13. To start off with, got a minor procedural change for Jack on his next P52, if he's ready to listen to that.
Okay. Jack's still off COMM. We'll hold off on that a little bit and then we'll pick it up when he gets on COMM.
Okay; fine. I've got two updates for you, Jim. One is a procedure for looking for Comet Bennett at about 49:45, and I'll wait till Jack gets up before passing you the details on that. The other update is concerned with going into the LM 3 hours early, and I think Vance mentioned to you last night that this was a possibility, that we'd like to look at the SHe tank pressure early. And since we're not going to do midcourse 3, we'd like LM entry at 55 hours. Is that okay with you?
Okay. Right, that's fine with us. We'll move up LM entry to 55 hours.
Okay. I've got some details on the flight plan for you as follows. Of course, since there's no MCC-3 you'll be deleting all the midcourse 3 stuff including the - the P52, which is called out at about 54-1/2, and we'll be slipping that until later, which I'll - which I'll tell - which I'll tell - which I'll tell you in a minute. Okay. Then you - we want to move the battery charge up 3 hours to about 52:30. And we want to move the - moving the LM tunnel vent valve to LM/CM DELTA-P up 3 hours to 52:45, and at that point you can simply go to the 57-hour point in the flight plan and change your number from 57 hours to 54 hours and start through that. In the remarks section at about 57:50 it says, "O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste water dump," here. If not performed earlier, we want you to do that at 54 hours and 50 minutes. The TV pass then, will be at 55 hours to 55:30. You'll go right through the LM Activation checklist stuff. I'm losing you; let's wait a minute.
13, Houston. How do you read me?
13, Houston. You back with us?
Apollo 13, Houston. Are you back with us?
We're back with you.
Okay. I've gone through the battery charge, the LM vent valve, the fuel cell purge, and then stop PTC at 55 hours, and your roll attitude there will be 285 degrees, which is per the flight plan. The high gain antenna angles are slightly different, pitch 23 and yaw 267 degrees. The TV pass till 55:30, the standard LM activation except for some special steps we'll give you to take a look at SHe tank pressure, which I don't have yet. Restart PTC at about 56:30 or whenever you're through with the LM activities, and after that, at your convenience, we'd like you to - to do the P52 option 3 that we cancelled at 54-1/2 hours. Over.
Okay. That last comment was that we'll do the P52 after we start PTC at about 56:30.
That's right. Any time after that; it's not time critical.
Okay. Let's see if I have some of this, Joe. Around 52:30 we're to do the battery charge on BAT - battery B.
That's correct.
And then about 52:40 we're going to do the LM tunnel vent valve, and the LM/CM DELTA-P which has been written up at 55:40.
That's correct.
We're deleting midcourse-3 and we've moved up the LM entry to 55 hours. So we'll merely follow all the - We'll follow all the procedures that leads up to LM entry that was originally scheduled for 58.
That's correct. You can start at 57 in the flight plan; call it 54 hours and press right on.
Okay. Then whenever we're finished with the LM, which we anticipate around 56:30, we'll commence PTC and sometime after that we'll do a P52.
That's affirmative. And did you copy the new high gain angles for 55 hours? The ones we had - -
Okay. We're going to stop the PTC for LM entry at roll 285, and high gain angles are pitch 23 and yaw 267.
That's correct, Jim. And, 13, Houston. The computer is yours.
The computer is ours. We're in BLOCK, and exactly when do you want the TV to be cranked up?
You can crank it up sometime prior to 55 hours at your convenience just to set it up. We'll be expecting transmission at 55 hours.
Okay.
And, Houston, Apollo 13. One thing I missed about the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste and water dump.
Roger. We'd like the the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and waste water dump at 54:50.
Roger. We'll pick up those items at 54:50.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
All right, Jack. One thing we'd like to have done sometime soon is to have you cycle the cryo fans in O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 one more time. We'd like to see if we can get that sensor back.
Okay. O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 fan on now.
Roger.
Houston, 13.
Go, 13.
We - We have just one question, the LM tunnel vent valve. We're questioning why we're venting until the DELTA-V is greater than 1.7 if we are going to open up the tunnel, then pressurize the LM usually.
Right. Stand by on that.
13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. The word on that, Jim, is that they want to insure the proper O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the LM when you get to the surface, and this is a method of doing that by bleeding out additional nitrogen.
Okay. Thank you.
And, 13, Houston. If Jack is up, I'd like to talk to him about the P52, briefly.
Okay. He's here.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay, Jack. What they'd like you to do on this P52 at 49 hours, they've been observing a slight jitter in the optics shaft angle of about 0.2 of a degree plus or minus. Before you come out of the OPTICS ZERO position, at the start of this P52, they'd like you to just observe the shaft readout, and see if the jitter occurs on your direct readout there, and also they'd like you to briefly call up a VERB 16, NOUN 91 so we can look at the shaft and trunnion angles.
Okay. Let's see if I got it right. On the P52 at 49 hours, before coming out of ZERO on the OPTICS, observe the shaft and also call up 16, 91 and let you look at the shaft and trunnion angles to observe a possible jitter. See whether it occurs in the ZERO position as well as out of ZERO.
Roger, Jack. That's correct; and if you have time, now, I've got a flight plan update for you on looking for the Comet Bennett.
Okay. Stand by 1, Joe. And the commander's going off the air briefly.
Roger that.
Okay, Joe. I'm ready to copy the ... now.
Okay, Jack. I'm going to read it to you, and then add some comments and we'll talk about it a little. This should occur sometime after 49:30. After the P52 realine at 49 hours, if time permits we would like the crew to investigate while in PTC if there is a roll angle in which the comet can be observed for photos. If there is, record the optimum roll angle for possible photography, prior to reinitiating PTC at 56:30 or so, whenever the guys are done in the LM, use P52 planet option, and the following half-unit vectors for tracking Comet Bennett at about 49:46. Are you ready to copy half-unit vectors? Over.
Okay. Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. R<sub>1</sub> plus 0.34202, R<sub>2</sub> minus 0.07374, R<sub>3</sub> plus 0.35719. Read back.
Okay. Copy R<sub>1</sub> plus 0.34202, R<sub>2</sub> minus 0.07374, R<sub>3</sub> plus 0.35719.
Okay. That's correct and the last sentence on the update is that you can expect AOS of the comet at a roll of 45 degrees and LOS at a roll of 155 degrees. Now, the deal here, Jack, according to the plots they showed me is, the comet appears to be about 10 degrees away from the Sun, and due to the geometry of the LM there shadowing the Sun, it would appear that you will be able to see the comet through the sextant without getting Sun shafting between roll angles of about 45 degrees and 75 degrees. It appears that as your roll gets higher than 75 degrees, although the comet is still in the field of view, the Sun is also in the field of view, and you probably will not have any success between 75 and 155 if you haven't got it from 45 to 75. If you do find that you can see the comet somewhere between 45 and 75 or 80 degrees, just note that roll angle and then if it's feasible we'd like you to photograph it after the LM entry part of the checklist. Over.
Okay, Joe. Let me give it back to you and see if I've got it here. After the P52, during our PTC you want us to use P52 and observe Bennett's Comet through the sextant; note a roll angle if we can find it visible. It would be visible somewhere between - ideally between 45 and 75 degrees, and we should lose it about 155 roll, and if we do see it, make an observation of whether it is photographable, note the roll angle for photographs to be taken after or prior to initiation of PTC at 56:30.
That's exactly right, Jack.
Okay. Real fine.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
We're ready to have to O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 fan off, and thank you.
Okay. Doesn't look like we got it back, huh?
No, it doesn't, Jack.
Houston, Apollo 13.
Houston, Apollo 13.
Hey, 13; Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Joe. I've started into P52 here. I've proceeded on option 3, and on the dis - 1520 - 1525 display, I've called up 1691. I'm going to let you observe and see while the - the shaft angle while the OPTICS are still in ZERO.
Okay. Roger that, Jack. We're looking at it, and I'll give you a mark as soon as GNC is happy.
Okay. Real fine.
13, Houston. Jack, could you give us a readout on your counter now?
Okay. I'm showing a shaft of 0.2 and a trunnion of 359.92.
Roger. Copy that. Is there any jumping around on the shaft?
You mean on the TPAC readout?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, it went from 0.2 to 0.21.
Okay. Copy that. Stand by 1.
Okay. Now it went down - It went down as low as 0.15.
Okay.
Jack, Houston. Let us watch that for another minute or so.
Okay. I'm in no hurry. It looked like it burned between 0.14 and 0.8 with an occasional spike up to 0.2.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Apollo 13, Houston. You can press on with P52 now. Over.
Okay, Joe.
Hey, Houston, are we clear to torque? Are you reading the torquing angles?
13, Houston. Go ahead and torque.
Okay. Time of torquing will be 49 hours 8 minutes 35 seconds.
Roger that.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. For Jack, we missed the star angle difference on the P52. Would you read us that?
Roger, Houston. It was all balls.
Okay. Thank you.
Hey, Houston; 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Joe. I got into P52 about 49:34. We loaded the planet - or Bennett Comet vectors into the planet option, and P52 tracked it all the way across except that it was always occulted by the LM, and we're in a roll angle of 155 now.
Roger. We're copying your roll angles. At what roll angle were you able to start tracking it, Jack?
Okay. At the time we entered it there, we were about 66 degrees roll, so either we started too late, or maybe somehow we got a wrong calculation on the roll angle.
Okay. Let me have GNC comment on that. I suspect that the roll angles we gave you were calculated for exactly 90 degrees pitch, and you're probably wobbling enough that they're not exactly correct.
Yes, I think you - You probably got the right idea.
13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. Notice you've secured from that, and that was going to be our recommendation, anyway. We're going to have the guys in the back room look at it and see if they can come up with some - with some better numbers based on the cone angle that - that you're traveling through, whether there are any roll angles that - that are available to you. And if there are, and we have time, we might give it another try; if not, we just will forget it.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay, Jack. I'd like to pass you a switch configuration on the CRYO O<sub>2</sub> TANKS and give you the reason. Right now, we'd like you to go to HEATERS tank 1, OFF; tank 2, AUTO, which is the opposite of the way you've got them now. Over.
Okay. Is this O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>?
This is O<sub>2</sub>, and stand by for a minute and we'll have a - Excuse me. This is H<sub>2</sub>, Jack; it's H<sub>2</sub>.
... is AUTO, ... 2 OFF.
Okay, Joe. Do we have you back again?
Okay, Jack. We're getting you back, and I hope you copied my - my correction of my mistake. I'm talking about the H<sub>2</sub> CRYO TANKS. We'd like the tank 1 HEATER to OFF; tank 2 to AUTO. Over.
Okay. We lost you again. Here's our heater configuration now. H<sub>2</sub> HEATERS 1, OFF; 2, AUTO. Both O<sub>2</sub> HEATERS are in AUTO.
Okay. That's the configuration we want you in, and here's what we're thinking about. When we went to tank 1 AUTO, tank 2 OFF; we found that the heater cycle had a tank 1 pressure of about 233 psi, which is well above the caution and warning limit, and if we go to that configuration for sleep, we'll keep from getting CAUTION AND WARNING lights during the sleep cycle. Okay. In order to do that comfortably, we want to spend the rest of the day using more H<sub>2</sub> out of tank number 2, so as to get an unbalance in favor of tank 1, so at the end of the sleep cycle it'll all come out even. And that's why we have you in tank 1 OFF, tank 2 AUTO, now. We expect to get about a 3-percent unbalance over the next 10 hours; and prior to sleep, we'll call you to reverse the configuration again. Now the only disadvantage here is that, during the day, you will probably get a few CAUTION AND WARNINGS, and we just figured it would be better to get them now than while you were sacked out. Over.
I'll buy that 100 percent.
Okay. Good deal. One other detail for you, Jack; GNC tells us that the OPTICS jitter is very similar to what we had on Apollo 12. It's no problem, but when you're not using the OPTICS, we recommend that you turn the OPTICS POWER switch to OFF to guard against a possible degradation as the flight progresses. Over.
Okay. Will do.
Okay. Apollo 13, Houston. I have one more little update for you, and it's another update to the erasable memory onboard crew charts on page G/9-2. Over.
Houston, 13. We're ready to copy.
Okay, Jim. These are gyro compensation terms. They've already been uplinked, and we're just updating your onboard charts now. In column A, number 11, change from 77646 to 00114; number 12, change from 77332 to 77546; number 13, change from 76617 to 77201. Over.
The changes are as follows, and all in column A: number 12, the new change is 77546; number 11, the new change is 00114; and 13, the new change is 77201. Over.
Roger. Readback correct.
And, Joe, do you know - Are you going to try and let us spot the Bennett Comet on this next revolution there? Or do you want me to turn the OPTICS power off now?
Stand by 1, Jack. Okay, Jack. We don't have confidence on those roll angles yet, so why don't you turn the OPTICS off, and we'll update you later.
Okay. Going off now.
Roger.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. If you've got a couple of minutes now, I'd like to read up to you the change to the LM entry procedure that we'd like you to observe at 55 hours, and the rationale for it. Over.
Okay, Stand by.
Roger.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. Before you start copying, this procedure is - is basically simply to activate the supercritical helium pressure gaging so that you can read it. And the concern here is lest this supercritical helium pressure reach 1800 psi by 103 hours, at which point we'd be within a possibility of rupturing the burst disk when you activate the DPS. Now, based on the pressure at launch, and based on a nominal rise time of about 6-1/2 psi per hour between then and now, the pressure should read about 710 psi. Stand by, 13, until we get better COMM.
Houston, you were cut out. Would you say again about the helium pressure.
Roger. Based on the prelaunch pressure in the SHe tank and the nominal rise time of about 6-1/2 psi per hour, the pressure should be about 710 at 55 hours. Are you reading? Over.
Jim, Houston. Did you read that last?
Okay, Joe. I 'm on OMNI C now. How do you read?
13, Houston. You're loud and clear now. INCO tells me he's having a little problem at Goldstone and wants me to stand by for a minute.
Okay. How do you read now, Joe? I'm going from OMNI C to D now.
You're still loud and clear on - on D, Fred. Stand by 1.
Okay. I'll put her back to OMNI B if you all want to take command again?
And the last thing we heard, Joe, was that the SUPERCRIT should be reading about 710 psi.
Okay. That's the last thing I passed up. And while we're waiting for INCO to decide here, let me continue. The deadband that is considered acceptable is between 660 and 770 psi. In other words, any rise time that'll give you one - a pressure between those two, will keep you below the critical pressure at 103 hours or so. So, we expect it to read in that - in that band and if it does, there will be no problem. If it reads between 770 and 800 psi, we will want you to check the pressure again at about 59 hours, and I'll get the detailed procedures in a minute. If the pressure is equal to or greater than 800 psi, we're going to have to go into some more detailed procedures; we're going to try to - to get PCM data on it, for one thing. We may have to have you sit there and stare at the gage for a while to find out when it clicks up and get an accurate rise time on it, and then in extreme case, we are even thinking about a DPS burn, but we don't really think that will happen. Now, if you are ready to copy, what I have for you is a change or an addition to the LM Activation checklist between pages TLC-1 and TLC-2, which consists of seven steps, and if you can find a blank side to write it down on, I would like to pass it up. Over.
Okay. How do you read on OMNI C, now?
Okay. You're loud and clear on OMNI C. Stand by 1 while we get INCO synced up.
Okay. The rest of your update was that it's okay if it is anywhere between 660 and 770 psi. If it's above 770, you are going to ask us to consider going back in at 59 hours and either get PCM going or sit there and give you gage reading changes on the basis of that. And you said something about an extreme measure. We may have to consider some sort of DPS maneuver.
That's correct, Fred. We don't have procedures for that yet, and we don't have any real expectation of getting into it. The procedure I'd like to read up to you now is simply the steps required to get the supercritical helium pressure reading at 55 hours. Over.
Okay.
Okay. We're calling this TLC-1A, step 6, "Transfer to LM power."
All right. Stand by 1, Joe.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. He's ready to copy.
Okay. Step 6, "Transfer to LM power (floodlights blank), CAUTION WARNING POWER CAUTION light ON. Report GET to MCC. Panel 11, CIRCUIT BREAKER EPS TRAESLUNAR BUS TIE, CLOSED. Circuit breaker panel 16, EPS TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, CLOSED. Circuit breaker panel 11, LIGHTING UTILITY, CLOSED. And activate utility lights." Over. And, 13, Houston. Select OMNI Bravo, please.
Okay, Joe. I've created a new page here called TLC-1A, item 6, Transfer to LM power and the usual check that the floodlight's blank and that I've got the CAUTION WARNING POWER light ON; I get a GET from Jack, and I will pass that on down to you. Item 7, CIRCUIT BREAKER EPS TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, panels 11 and 16, CLOSED. Step 8, circuit breaker lighting and utility on panel 1, CLOSED, and turn on the utility lights. However, the lighting is such that I don't really need those. They are in stowage, right now, I guess, in the ISA, and I'll probably just leave them there.
Okay. That's optional. The way we had page TLC-1A written, that was all part of step 6. You haven't even gotten to step 7 yet. Step 7 is as follows.
Fred, Houston. Are you with me?
Apollo 13, Houston. Are you reading me now?
Okay. Houston, 13. How do you read?
13, Houston. Loud and clear. What OMNI you on now?
I'm going to stay OMNI B, if you all want to take command back and you can let INCO jockey them around between B and D. And how many steps we got, so I know whether to write big or small here, Joe?
Okay. We got steps 6 through 12, but step 7 is the same size as 6, and 8 through 12 are short. They're only one line each.
Okay.
Okay. Step 7 follows: "Circuit breaker panel 11, AC BUS B, HELIUM PQGS PROPELLANT DISPLAY, CLOSED. Circuit breaker 11, AC BUS B, NUMERIC LIGHTING, CLOSED. Circuit breaker 11, AC BUS B, BUS TIE INVERTER 1, CLOSED. Circuit breaker panel 11, EPS INVERTER 1, CLOSED. Circuit breaker panel 16, INSTRUMENTATION SIG SENSOR, CLOSED. INVERTER 1" - -
Hold on a minute, Joe.
Okay.
My shorthand is rather poor today.
Okay I'm now up to circuit breaker panel 11, INVERTER 1, CLOSED.
Okay. Next was "Circuit breaker panel 16, INSTRUMENTATION SIG SENSOR, CLOSED. Then INVERTER 1, SELECT. Then HELIUM MONITOR to SUPERCRIT PRESS. Report SUPERCRIT PRESS to MCC." Over.
Houston, 13. How do you read?
13, Houston. You're coming through. We still have some background noise. Do you want to read back step 7?
Hello, Houston; 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Joe. The last thing I got was HELIUM MONITOR to SUPERCRIT PRESSURE.
Okay. The last part of step 7 is, "Report SUPERCRIT PRESSURE to MCC," and read back step 7.
Okay. Step 7. Circuit breaker panel 11, AC BUS B, HELIUM PQGS DISPLAY, CLOSED. Main - Circuit breaker panel 11, AC BUS B, NUMERIC LIGHTING, CLOSED. CD panel 11, AC BUS - Is that AC BUS B? BUS TIE INVERTER 1, CLOSED?
That's affirmative.
And CB - CB EPS INVERTER 1, panel 11, CLOSED. CB panel 16, INSTRUMENT SIGNAL SENSOR, CLOSED. INVERTER 1, SELECT. HELIUM MONITOR to SUPERCRIT PRESSURE. Report pressure to MSFN.
Okay. That's correct. Now step 8 is, "On MCC request, perform step 9." In other words, you wait for us to decide what to do and that's according to the gouge we've already given you. And step 9, I'll give you now, is "HELIUM MONITOR to OFF, INVERTER to OFF." Over.
Okay. Step 8 says, "Set in an MCC hold." Step 9 says, "On MCC' s words, HELIUM MONITOR OFF, INVERTER OFF."
Roger. That's correct. Step 10 is, "Configure circuit breaker panels per Activation 3 and 4."
Okay. Configure - step 10, "Configure circuit breakers per Activation pages 3 and 4."
Roger. That's correct. Step 11 is, "Deactivate the utility lights if you activated them," and step 12 which is the last one is, "Transfer to CSM power, usual observations, and report time to MCC."
Okay. Step 11, "Deactivate utility lights." 12, "Transfer to CSM power and note the usual observations and report the GET."
Okay. That's it. And, of course, Houston will be requesting you to go to step 9 if the pressure is less than 770. If the pressure is between 770 and 800, we will be asking you to do the following, if you're ready to copy.
Stand by. I've got to find some more blank paper.
Yes. This is going to be page TLC-3, but it's very short.
Okay. Go ahead with TLC-3.
Okay. Stand by 10 seconds, Fred.
Fred, Houston.
All right. Go ahead.
Roger. We'll hold off on that. It was a short three-step procedure which said, "Repeat activation pages 1, 1A, and 2," but there was another step in it that nobody understands. So, essentially what we'd recommend in that case would be that you would repeat the procedure that we just passed up for reading the SUPERCRIT pressure. If we need to, we'll clarify it later on. And that's all we've got.
Okay.
Houston, 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. One thing, Joe; I just want to doublecheck again. All the stuff that normally was going to start at 57 hours, which the first item was pressurize CSM to 5.7 psia, we're going to move that up to 64 now, so we have our LM entry which was nominally at 58 at 55. Is that correct?
That's correct, Jim.
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, 13. Because of the O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 quantity sensor drop out, EECOM wants to keep a little closer track of the cryo quantities, and he's going to be asking you to stir all the cryo tanks at slightly more frequent intervals than had been planned, and the first time is now, and we will be calling you probably every 5 or 6 hours, except during sleep period and high activity periods. We'd like you to do it now. Over.
Okay. We'll start it ... now.
Thank you.
And, 13, Houston. For your information, a normal 1-minute or so stir will be fine.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, just an advisory; expect a CAUTION AND WARNING on H<sub>2</sub> tank 1 pretty quick. No problems; Just warning you about it.
Okay. A zero pressure light on H<sub>2</sub> tank 1 coming on shortly, huh?
Right.
Okay. Well, you're pretty close. It just came on.
Any other predictions you'd like?
Well, there's - I guess there's all sorts. Could you go to the horse races with me?
I'm sorry; you were garbled. Say again?
I said I'd like to invite you to the horse races with me.
Right. We'll - We'll send EECOM.
Well, it's time for a little grits again here, Vance.
Understand. Some grits, huh? Chow. Bon apetit.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Just expect that same CAUTION AND WARNING to come on again. And you want us to keep warning you of that thing?
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. Just expect a CAUTION AND WARNING to come on the same as it did about an hour ago.
Go ahead, Houston. We've lost ...
Roger. How are you reading me now, Jim?
Houston, Apollo 13.
13, Houston. How do you read now?
Okay. Read you good now. Seems like we've had a little trouble with the COMM today.
Yes. I guess it's partly because you are further out. We just wanted to tell you that you were going to get that CAUTION WARNING that you just got.
Right. We just got.
And I won't bother you with those calls anymore, unless you especially want them.
That's okay, Vance. You don't have to call us about that, unless it's something serious.
Okay.
We just ate a can of ham salad and that was an experience.
Roger. Copy.
It's really kind of like eating on the sly. Chasing it around.
Right. Copy.
But good.
...
Houston, Apollo 13.
13, Houston. Go ahead.
Right, we're not doing anything right now, Vance, we're just getting curious, we could start the LM entry procedures, and get everything squared away, and then when the TV comes up at 55 hours, we can just use it for the TV, and we wouldn't be worrying about checking out the SHe tank pressures and everything like that.
Okay, let us mull that one a minute here, and I'll get right back with you.
Okay.
Also, Houston, Apollo 13. We'd like to move up the waste water dump and maybe the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge a little bit early, if we could.
Okay, stand by.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, you're clear to go on into the LM, and just advise though that the TV time is still fixed at 55 hours, and - so we'll be standing by to support your entry and we'll get back with you on a minute - in a minute on the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and the waste water dump.
Okay. Sounds good.
And also request your LM/CM DELTA-P which was on the flight plan for 53 hours. What did you vent it down to? Over.
We have 1.7 now. We vented it down to that figure.
Okay, you vented down to 1.7, and what did it start at?
It was about 1.1, Vance.
Roger, copy.
Houston, 13.
Go ahead, 13.
What do you read for suit pressure down there?
We're reading 4.3, Fred.
Okay.
Houston, 13.
Go ahead, Apollo 13.
We'd like another confirmation, when we closed the tunnel vent valve back to LM/CM DELTA-P, we were reading about 1.7 - 1.75, and it slowly went up now to about - oh, I'd say a little less than 2.2. Seems to be holding there - Is there a lag in the gaging system?
Okay. We'll - we'll ask that question. Stand by.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, to answer your question, Jim, that increase in pressure is normal, because it was just tracking an increase in cabin pressure.
Okay. Okay.
We're not thinking today.
And, 13, from Houston, it's okay with us if you want to move the O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge and the water dump up to this time. Over.
Okay. We'll work it in shortly. Thank you.
Right.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, recommend you stay in the PTC until we stop it for the TV at 55 hours, in case you were thinking of - -
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Recommend you continue PTC until 55 hours. Over.
You were calling, Houston?
That's affirmed, Jim. How do you read now?
Okay. We read you loud and clear.
Okay. The only comment that we just made was that, in case you were thinking of stopping PTC, there's no need to stop it until 55 GET when TV starts.
Right. We'll stop it when we're setting up our TV.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, the waste water dump and O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge are complete.
Houston. Roger.
Okay, Houston, the LM/CM DELTA-P is constant. We're going to go ahead with hatch removal.
Houston. Roger.
Is that you, Jack?
No, this is Jack's replacement.
Okay, Houston; 13.
Houston, go ahead.
Go ahead, 13.
Houston, Apollo 13.
This is Houston. Go ahead, 13.
Okay, Houston; Apollo 13.
Roger. Go ahead, 13.
Okay. The LMP has entered the LM.
Roger.
Is that Big John?
It sure is. How're you doing?
Fine.
Yes, you're doing great, man.
Thank you. I had a good CDR.
You're doing it on your own now.
Yes, it feels like I'm back at home, again, John, down in here.
I hope you did a good job, John.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, we want to take the FM and bring up TV here for our own use. Then we'll go to TRANSMIT 1 - at 55 hours.
Roger, 13.
Okay, Houston, we've transferred to LM power; the time was 54 hours 46 minutes 15 seconds.
Roger, Jack. Transfer to LM power. Thank you.
And the docking-tunnel index, Jack, was minus 2 degrees.
Say again, Fred, you're coming in with a lot of background noise.
Okay. The docking-tunnel index mark was minus 2 degrees.
Roger. Minus 2 degrees.
Okay. Jack, how do you read?
Fred, Houston is reading you loud and clear.
Okay. I've got up through step 7 now, and I'm not getting much of a light in the helium indicator here. Why don't I review for you how we've proceeded, and you look at the procedure you gave me, and see if we've missed anything.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. We transferred to LM power and that looked okay. I'm staring at a CAUTION AND WARNING POWER light, and all the red flags; and we got both X LUNAR BUS TIE breakers IN. The UTILITY LIGHTING breaker is IN; then AC BUS B HELIUM PQS DISPLAY; the AC BUS B NUMERIC LIGHTING, and AC BUS B INVERTER 1 is - BUS TIE is CLOSED. Then I closed the INVERTER 1 breaker, and I've selected, on panel 16, and the SIGNAL CONSENSOR [sic] breaker is in; I've selected INVERTER 1 and put the HELIUM MONITOR switch to SUPERCRIT and I have no lights.
Okay, Fred, let us take a look at it.
I was wondering, do we need an A - do we need, possibly, in the - one of the ANUN/DOCK/COMPONENT breakers in?
Stand by 1.
Okay, Jack. Hold the phone. I forgot the rheostat was cranked all the way down on the ANUN/NUM and it's showing 720, which looks like a pretty good - pretty good number.
Roger. We copy 720. Thank you, Fred - -
Flashed to 7 - Okay, and it just flickered down to 710. It's kind of flickering between 710 and 720.
Roger. 710 to 720.
Okay, Fred. Those are good numbers, and we're not going to have to crank up the TM. That's the number we were looking for.
Very good. Okay. Do you want me to back out of this in reverse at least as far as getting this part of it powered down?
Stand by 1.
Fred, this is Houston. Go ahead and back out of this little test and proceed.
Roger.
Okay. We're back on CSM power. The time was 54 hours 58 minutes 50 seconds.
Roger, Jack. 54:58:50. Thank you.
Okay, Houston, we'll try to pick you up on the high gain.
Roger.
And, 13, we're ready on the TV when you are.
This is 13. Say again, Houston.
13, we're ready on the TV when you are. Any time.
Okay, sounds good. With you in a minute, we're just cranking up high gain now.
Okay, Houston. How do you read us in the high gain?
We're hearing you 5 square, Jim, how me?
Okay. You're coming through okay.
As you were on that, Jim. We don't have you on high gain yet. We're still looking at you.
13, Houston. In this attitude, we'd suggest pitch 5, yaw 237 on the high gain. Over.
Pitch 5, yaw 237. Roger.
Okay, Jack. Can you - can you read the high gain now?
Affirmative, Jack. We've got you on a high gain and it appears to us that we're in wide beam - wide beam width.
Yes. We can't get it to come down to narrow. We tried to switch to AUTO track or REACQ, and it - yaw drives around from 270 to 0. And pitch goes from about 6 degrees around to 90. I'm trying - we're fitting it manual now at the angles that you gave us, and I'll try and get you in medium and narrow beam widths picking it up manually here.
Roger, Jack. Meanwhile, we'll look at the situation you describe there.
Okay. And it does it on both sets of servo electronic power.
Jack, what it looks like is that, when we hit 239 degrees at this attitude, it hit some sort of scan limit or something and drops off.
Roger, Jack; thank you.
Okay, I'm trying you in wide or medium beam width now.
Can you pick up the TV in this condition here at all?
Negative, Jack. We'll have to have the narrow beam width.
Okay. Can you give us, maybe, a slight maneuver?
Jack, we'd like you to check two high gain circuit breakers down in panel 25. Check your high gain group 2 and your high gain in the flight bus. Over.
Okay. Okay, Jack, they're both IN.
Roger.
13, we've got an attitude suggestion for you. We suggest that you go to roll 285 and try pitch 90 and yaw 0. Over.
Okay.
Okay, Houston; Apollo 13. I think we've got high gain locked up now. Do you confirm?
We confirm that, Jim, we've got you locked up on the high gain and narrow beam.
Okay, sounds good. We'll get the TV started right away.
Roger.
13, Houston. We'd like to disable quads C and D; use Alfa and Bravo. Over.
Okay - -
- - Disable quads C and D. Roger.
Okay, 13. We've got Fred-o on TV.
Roger, Houston. What we plan to do for you today is start out in the space shipper [sic] Odyssey, and take you on through from Odyssey in through the tunnel into Aquarius. And show you a little bit of the landing vehicle, and your TV operator is now resting on the center couch, looking at Fred Haise, whose head is now just about at the beginning of the tunnel, and his back is against the lower-equipment-bay optical area. And Fred will now transport himself into the tunnel, and into the spaceship Aquarius.
You know one thing I noted, Jack, when I first came across here, that starting upright in the command module and heading down in Aquarius, there's a little bit of an orientation change that, even though I'd been through it once in the water tank, it still pretty unusual. I find myself, now, standing with my head on the floor when I get down inside the LM.
That's a great picture, Jim. You got the light just right.
And one of the nice things, Jack, particularly for a novice like myself, is the - the ease of moving around in here. It's, of course, as you know from working in the command module simulator, it's really quite a boon to have zero gravity as an aid. Because you get - pretty confining, really, at one g, to move around very much in there, and it's quite easy in this environment. The LM, as you can see, it looked pretty clean, I found a couple of loose washers about it and the - a little plastic cap off the sequence camera had come loose and I found it lodged over by the ED panel. Okay. Right under Jim, now, he's actually standing on a - what looks to be a can here. And, for the sake of all the people back there, housed inside this can is the - the LM ascent engine where, hopefully, you can see my hand resting on top of right now - the engine that we use to get off of the Moon. Immediately adjacent to the engine cover here, I have my hand on a white box now, which has been shown before. This happens to be Jim's PLSS, or the backpack which'll supply oxygen and water for cooling while on the lunar surface. This device we hope to make use of for - a planned 4 hours and possibly up to as much as 5 hours. Right - right behind the PLSS, a couple of little square packages I now have my hand on here, one here and one right below, are our OPSs, which are, in essence, the emergency oxygen supplies, which are good for some 40 to 45 minutes. These are when we get ready to mount up and head outside, will be placed up on top of the PLSS.
The second backpack is mounted down on the LM floor, I hope, positioned right between the two of us. I have my hand on it at this time.
Roger, Fred. We see it. The picture's coming through real good, and your description is good. We see Jim's got the camera oriented the way we like to look at it. So, keep talking.
Okay. I guess everybody has pretty much envisioned the space program as being all a lot of exotic electronics, and, certainly, a lot of it is. But I thought I'd bring out a couple of items here in conjunction with the PLSS. After the first EVA, you get a very accurate measurement of the amount of water that's left in the PLSSs. We're going to make use of this bag I'm showing now to collect the remaining water out of the PLSS and see just how much we really did have left, and hopefully, on future missions, to be able to extend safely the allowable time on these units even a little further. And, my other hand, I have the mechanism by which we determine just how much water we really have in this bag. And I guess this - an apt description for this device would be a fish scale. And you can see I'm weighing myself right now, and it says I weigh actually less than zero right now. Guess its calibration isn't too good.
That'll be the day.
I think even you'd weigh zero here, Jack.
Touché.
Houston, this is Jim. Since Fred's been in the lunar module, and since he's the lunar module pilot, this is the first time that he's felt that he's been right-side up.
Roger, Jim.
I might tell you that we're looking at right now, that round bag that's just behind Fred holds our vacuum hose; and when we get back inside the LM we'll hook the vacuum off our suits, and it's resting or it's attached to the hatch which will - we will open to go on to the lunar surface, and, of course, to come back in. The hatch which we have come to now is a round hatch, which is our docking hatch between the - between Odyssey and Aquarius.
Roger, and we see Fred looking in the vacuum cleaner there now.
Okay, what I have out now, Jack, is LEVVA, which has also been shown before. It's a head garment for wearing out on the surface, and I - I'm bringing Jim's out here to show a couple of MODs. One problem before is that the cast of characters down on the surface haven't been able to be distinguished apart very well. So, not only Jim's suit has some red stripes on it, but as you can see his LEVVA also has a - a red stripe. And now you can see one other MOD here too, Jack, which I hadn't really seen myself before. I guess on 12, Pete and A1 had commented about the - commented about having trouble with sunlight in the eyes, so on our LEVVAs they put on a new center section which you can pull down and use sort of like a baseball cap.
Okay, Jack. Who fixed up our LEVVAs?
How's the detail on this one, Jack?
Say again, Fred.
Can you see any detail in this picture now, or am I blocking out too much of the sunlight?
That's affirmative. We've got a good picture of the LEVVA there, and it's coming through loud and clear.
Okay.
Okay, Jack, while Fred is putting away my helmet, you are looking over into Fred's station now. How's this picture, is it okay before - or do I have to adjust it?
We have a hunch that the setting might be in PEAK but we recommend AVERAGE on the ALC if you haven't got it there already.
We're in AVERAGE, Jack.
Okay. And we're getting a good picture of the LMP side with the DEDA over there.
Hey, Jack, one question on the command module here. Do I - I have the DAP right now wide deadband. Do you want me to begin setting up narrow deadband and nulling the rates to start PTC again?
Stand by, Jack.
What I'm fishing out now, Jack, is another new piece of hardware that we are taking along this time as a result of some comments made on the Apollo 12 flight.
What Fred is opening up - is a drink bag that we place inside of our neckring that will allow us to drink while we are on the lunar surface. They - Pete and Al - did not have that on Apollo 12 and they, consequently, got very thirsty. But we hope to alleviate that situation by having our own little bag of water which, with very little effort, we can have a sip or two while we are looking around and doing our geology work.
So if you hear any funny noises, it is just probably the drink bag.
Fred, the bag's empty.
Fred is now looking through our optical device. It's an instrument in which to aline our platform, and Fred is now looking into it just to see what kind of an outside picture he might be able to get. We might be able to use a TV camera to look through our optical instrument to the outside of the command module. A few minutes ago while we first came in, we did manage to look to the outside of the side hatch of the command module through our optical instrument. Stand by. We'll try to see what we can do here.
Roger, Jim. Break, Jack, we'd like you to stay in the deadband you are now in, and we'll make a change when the TV is over. Another thing we would like you to do is check your pitch and yaw on your high gain meter so we can compare it with what we're seeing down here.
Okay, it's showing about - say 28 degrees and 267.
20 and 267.
28 - 28 and 267.
Okay, Jack, have you got that picture now?
Fred, about one-quarter of our screen is lighted and it's impossible to determine what you are looking at right now. Maybe you could give us a little verbal description.
Okay. It's looking through the AOT in position 4, right rear. And we're looking back toward the - over the side hatch at the aft side of the service module.
Okay. Is - is it too dark a picture, Jack? You think the f-stop open may help?
No, Fred, it's got to be centered up a little bit. That's primarily what you have to do.
Jack, we can't center it up any more, because the side hatch is only one part of the AOT. The rest of that blackness you see is really space.
Okay. We'll try another one, and it's a little better centered. In fact, the only other one we have that shows the whole picture. We're in the forward detent of the AOT now, position 2, and you should be seeing something familiar like a radar antenna.
Okay, we see you moving the camera up to the AOT lens, and we got a real good picture now.
And -
Okay, Jack, I'm looking out the right window now, and not too far off in the distance now, you can see the objective, and I'll zoom in on it here a little and see if it brings it in better.
And it's actually beginning to look a little bigger now. You can see quite distinctly some of the features with the naked eye. And so far, I guess I have to even agree with Jim that it's still looking pretty gray with white spots.
Okay, Fred. We're getting a good picture of your destination there.
Jack, you've been looking at the - at Fred's workshop now, and you can see the abort guidance computer. And over there on the - tucked away in his armrest, is our activation checklist, which we'll be using very shortly. Up on the top of the window, we have our camera already mounted ready for photographing the descent. And now Fred's engaged in his favorite pastime, I found out on this flight so far.
He's not in the food locker, is he?
That's his second favorite pastime. He's rigging his hammock for sleep on the lunar surface now to find out - to see what it's going to be like.
Roger. Sleeping and then eating.
It's kind of difficult here, Jack, getting into a hammock in zero g. I'm not sure if I keep floating away from it or it keeps moving away from me.
If you notice a few things floating around, we found just about one or two washers occasionally.
And for the benefit of those that may wonder where Jim sleeps. Be a little difficult to rig his hammock in here right now with the hatch open, but his runs laterally in this direction, fore aft. So he has the upper berth and I get the lower berth.
And now while Fred's taking his hammock down and restowing it, I might give you some idea of what sort of confusion of attitudes since there is no up or down, and I'm situated on top of the ascent engine just at the entrance to the tunnel. I'll reverse the camera 180 degrees and go from Fred, look through the tunnel again back at Odyssey, and we might pick up part of Jack.
There he is. We see him.
Okay, Houston. For the benefit of the television viewers, we've just about completed our little inspection of Aquarius, and now we're proceeding through the hatchy-gap into the tunnel and going back toward the Odyssey.
Okay, Jim. It's been a great show so far.
And finally, Jack's let me back into the Odyssey as we slide on through the tunnel here
Houston, 13. Are you still on TV?
Yes, we sure are. We've got a good picture of the skipper there.
Okay. What we can show you now, a little added benefit, we've got the drogue on Fred's couch in the command module right now. We stowed it temporarily while we're checking out the - out Aquarius and underneath his couch, we've got the probes stowed. Quite a big cumbersome device, and we'll get a shot of it for you.
You're looking now at our probe, the place on the nose of Odyssey. It's a very heavy thing but I suppose in zero gravity it weighs nothing, and it's much easier to move around. As a matter of fact, both Fred and Jack commented, as many people in the past have, of how much bigger the spacecraft appears in actual flight when you have such ease in moving compared to our simulator which make training rather difficult.
Okay. We're seeing a good picture of the probe there, Jim, and looks like the characters shaved before the show this time.
Well, Fred said he had to keep up his TV image.
Yes. That may be my first and last time though, Jack.
It took Fred 1 hour to shave.
We might give you a quick - a quick shot of our entertainment on board the spacecraft, which has been keeping us company for some time.
(Music - Willow Weep For Me)
This little tape recorder has been a big benefit - has been a big benefit to us in passing some of our time away on our transit to the Moon, and it's rather odd to see it floating like this in Odyssey while it's playing the theme from "2001." And, of course, the tapes wouldn't be complete without "Aquarius."
Okay, Jim. We're seeing the tape recorder now, and just - by the way, how long do you expect to keep the TV on this evening?
Well, when we - Stand by 1.
Yes, I got them with the cabin repress valve again there, Jack.
Every time he does that our hearts - our hearts jump in our mouth. And, Jack, any time you want to terminate TV, we're all set to go.
Okay, Jim. It's been a real good TV show. We think we ought to conclude it from here now. What do you think?
Roger. Sounds good. And this is the crew of Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening, and we're just about ready to close out our inspection of Aquarius and get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey. Good night.
Thank you, 13.
Apollo 13, Houston. The next thing we'd like you to do is to -
Go ahead.
- - we'd like you to roll right to 060 and null your rates for photography of the Comet Bennett. To do that, we would like you to enable quads C and D. For the maneuver, use all your quads. And in precisely 1 minute, we'd like you to terminate the battery charge on battery B. One other request, we'd like to have you verify - -
Okay. Will do.
One other request, we'd like you to verify your high gain configuration. We'd like to know what track mode, what SERVO, and what beam width.
Okay, Jack, during the TV, we were AUTO TRACK, NARROW BEAM WIDTH, and the PRIMARY ELECTRONICS. And we had a good lockup. Just after we started the maneuver, I was able to lock you up and get real good signal strength, and it just seemed that right there at about 239 degrees in yaw, that the signal strength would just drop off and yaw would go to zero and pitch would go to 90.
Roger. We copy, and the TV show was great.
Okay, real fine. Okay, I'm going to maneuver to 060, 090, and 0.
And, 13, we'd like you to check C-4 thruster.
Okay, Jack. The battery charge has been terminated on the battery B.
Roger. We see it, Jack. And we got a reading of minus 2 degrees on the docking index. We'd like to know it that's 2.0 precise or if it's 2.1 or 1.9.
No. It's a minus 2.0 precisely.
Thank you.
13, we've got one more item for you, when you get a chance. We'd like you to stir up your cryo tanks. In addition, I have shaft and trunnion - -
- - for looking at the Comet Bennett, if you need it.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay, Houston - -
I believe we've had a problem here.
This is Houston. Say again, please.
Houston, we've had a problem. We've had a MAIN B BUS UNDERVOLT.
Roger. MAIN B UNDERVOLT.
Okay, stand by, 13. We're looking at it.
Okay. Right now, Houston, the voltage is - is looking good. And we had a pretty large bang associated with the CAUTION AND WARNING there. And as I recall, MAIN B was the one that had had an amp spike on it once before.
Roger, Fred.
In the interim here, we're starting to go ahead and button up the tunnel again.
Roger.
Yes. That jolt must have rocked the sensor on - see now - O<sub>2</sub> QUANTITY 2. It - was oscillating down around 20 to 60 percent. Now it's fullscale high again.
Roger.
And, Houston, we had a RESTART on our computer and we had a PGNCS light and the RESTART RESET.
Roger. RESTART and a PGNCS light. RESET on a PGNCS, RESET - -
Okay. And we're looking at our S - SERVICE MODULE RCS HELIUM 1. We have - B is barber poled and D is barber poled, HELIUM 2, D is barber pole, and SECONDARY PROPELLANTS, I have A and C barber pole. BMAG temperatures?
Okay, AC 2 is showing zip. I'm going to try to reconfigure on that, Jack.
Roger.
Yes. We got a MAIN BUS A UNDERVOLT now, too, showing.
MAIN A UNDERVOLT.
It's reading about 25-1/2, MAIN B is reading zip right now.
And, Houston, Odyssey.
Stand by 1, Jim.
13, Houston. We'd like you to attempt to reconnect fuel cell 1 to MAIN A and fuel cell 3 to MAIN B. Verify that quad Delta is open.
Okay, Houston. I'm showing - I tried to reset and fuel cell 1 and 3 are both showing gray flags, but they are both showing zip on the flows.
We copy.
Okay, Houston. Are you still reading 13?
That's affirmative. We're reading you. We're trying to come up with some good ideas here for you.
Okay. Let me give you some reading ... in the interim to help MAIN A voltage, Jack. I've got BUS TIE AC on.
Say again, Fred.
In the interim, to help out MAIN A voltage, I've got MAIN BUS TIE BAT AC on. Or would you rather accept the 25 volts we are seeing on MAIN A?
Okay. BUS TIE AC on.
13, Houston. We need OMNI Charlie, please.
You got it.
13, Houston. We'd like you to verify couple of readings for us. We would like the nitrogen pressure on fuel cell 1. We need the oxygen pressure on fuel cell 2.
Okay. Nitrogen on 1 and oxygen on 2. Is that correct?
Negative. Oxygen on 3.
Okay.
Okay. The systems test 1-A says zip.
And 2 Baker, which is 3 oxygen, says 0.6.
2 Baker says 0.6, and say again the other one.
Fuel cell 1 nitrogen reads zero.
Roger. Zero.
13, Houston. We'd like you to open circuit fuel cell 1; leave 2 and 3 as is.
Okay. I'll get to work on that.
And, Jack, our O<sub>2</sub> quantity number 2 tank is reading zero. Did you get that?
O<sub>2</sub> QUANTITY number 2 is zero.
That's AC, okay. Yes, that's good AC and it looks to me, looking out the hatch, that we are venting something. We are venting something out into the - into space.
Roger. We copy your venting.
It's a gas of some sort.
Okay. Fuel cell 1, you just wanted it off the line now, Jack, is that right?
We just wanted you to open the circuit on fuel cell 1.
Okay. She's off the line.
13, Houston. We see you getting close to gimbal lock there. We'd like you to bring up all quad Cs on MAIN A, quad C-1, C-2, C-3, C-4 on MAIN A, and also bring B-3 and B-4 up on MAIN A.
13, Houston. Do you read?
Yes. We got it.
Affirm.
Okay. Can you tell us anything about the venting, where it is coming from, what window you see it at.
It's coming out of window 1, right now, Jack, and could you give me the thrusters again?
Okay, the thrusters - -
What buses?
We'd like - on MAIN A, we'd like Charlie 1, 2, 3, and 4. Also Bravo 3 and 4 on MAIN A.
Okay. Got it.
13, we need OMNI Bravo.
OMNI Bravo.
Okay, 13; this is Houston. We'd like you to go to your G&C checklist, the pink pages, 1-5. Do powerdown until we get a Delta of 10 amps. Over.
All right. Roger.
Okay, Jack, say again that - ... for the powerdown; it's not in the pink pages, the 1-5.
Okay. We'd like you to go down that powerdown procedure until you get a Delta of 10 amps. Over.
Roger. ...
13, Houston. Did you copy our powerdown request?
Roger, Jack. We're - yes, we're doing it right now.
Where did you say that was located, Jack?
That's in your systems checklist, page 1-5.
And, 13, you might also check for those pages in your launch checklist. They're emergency pages; pink pages, 1-5, and we'd like you to power down until you get - -
Okay. That was in the launch checklist, Jack.
Roger. Power down until you get an amperage of 10 amps less than what you got now. Over.
Okay.
Okay. Jack. Are you happy with the amps we have now?
Stand by 1, Fred.
Okay, Jack, and on this page 1-5, we proceeded right down the list, all the way down; we're right now at BMAG number 2 is in WARM UP.
Roger. We copy BMAG 2 in WARM UP. We'll follow you through.
Okay, and something is giving us a reach, Jack, both in pitch and roll, so I'm suspecting that maybe it's whatever it is that's venting back there. I've had to use DIRECT in order to stabilize this, and as soon as I do, we're starting to pick up rates again. Can you pick up any jets firing?
Stand by. What direction are your rates in, Jack?
It's negative pitch and negative roll.
Roger.
13, Houston. We need to get some more instrumentation up. We'd like you to put INVERTER 1 on both AC BUSES. Over.
Okay. Okay, you got INVERTER 1 on both AC BUSES now. And Jack, one of the items that we turned off was the - all the fuel cell pumps. Okay, and you might let us know when fuel cell 2 needs its pump back; we ought to take care of that guy.
Roger. Okay, Fred, we want FUEL CELL 2 PUMPS to AC1, please.
FUEL CELL 2 to AC1. Roger.
Okay, it's on AC1.
OMNI Charlie, please, 13.
OMNI Charlie.
Okay, 13. We've got lots and lots of people working on this; we'll give you some dope as soon as we have it, and you'll be the first one to know.
Oh, thank you.
Okay, Jack, and the weird configuration we're sitting in now is we have the hatch installed, we still have the probe and drogue inside the command module, and we're going to stay in this situation until you - kind of give us an okay to reinstall the probe and drogue.
Roger. We'll give you an answer.
Or, if necessary, to use the LM consumables.
Roger.
13, we'd like to have you put thruster Alfa 3 on MAIN A, please.
Alfa 3 on MAIN A.
Okay, Jack, are you monitoring the quad temps in quad A - package temps?
Affirmative.
13, this is Houston. We'd like to power down just a little bit more, so let's get BMAG 2 OFF; and make sure your lights are down. Over.
Okay. The lights are down, and BMAG 2's going from STANDBY to OFF.
13, Houston - -
Okay, Jack, now I've got a rate -
- - we'd like you to open circuit fuel cell 3.
Open circuit fuel cell 3.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay, fuel cell 3 is off the line now.
And 13, Houston. We'd like you to turn all your Bravo thrusters OFF; and put all your Delta thrusters on MAIN A, please.
All Delta thrusters on MAIN A and all Bravo thrusters OFF. Roger.
13, Houston. Turn BATTERY A OFF - -
Okay, Jack, ...
...
That's right; we were pulling current all the time.
BATTERY A OFF. Roger.
Now you're ... up.
I'm transmitting. I don't have any current now.
Hey, it's off - it's off. They - they killed the bus completely now.
13, Houston. We'd like you to isolate your O<sub>2</sub> surge tank. Over.
Surge tank off now, Jack? Okay, Jack, are you copying - O<sub>2</sub> tank 1 cryo pressure?
That's affirmative. And we're trying to get power to that tank. Stand by; we're working on it.
Okay.
Okay. We had a - SERVICE MODULE RCS B light, jack, due to package temperature.
SERVICE MODULE RCS B. We copy. No problem.
Let's read you the lights we got on now; CRYO PRESS, FUEL CELL 1, FUEL CELL 3, MAIN BUS B UNDERVOLT, SUIT COMPRESSOR.
Roger, we copy them and we'd like to build up the pressure in O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, so turn the heaters on manually; we'll watch the pressure for you.
Okay, do you want to see - -
Go ahead.
- - We're going to get a MAIN BUS A UNDERVOLT, probably.
Roger. We realize that; we feel we can stand 5 more amps on it.
Okay.
Okay, heater on tank 1's ON.
13, Houston. We'd like you to additionally bring on the fans in O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, and we can stand the additional amperage on that.
Okay - bring up the fans on O<sub>2</sub> tank 1.
13, Houston. We'd like you to check some circuit breakers on panel 226. CRYO O<sub>2</sub> HEATER number 1 MAIN A, and check the three CRYO FAN MOTORS, TANK 1, three phases.
Okay, Jack. 226 is configured just like it should be. I got three REACS breakers and three RAD breakers open. All the rest are closed.
Okay, Fred. Thank you.
Jack, looking outside, the number of particles has diminished greatly, almost ceased now, which indicates maybe what was venting has almost stopped.
Roger, Jack. Thank you. We copy.
I'm still getting some rates in negative pitch, though.
Roger.
And, 13, we'd like to verify that both BMAGs are off, please.
Negative. We just have one BMAG. BMAG number 1 is still on.
Okay, Jack. Let's take BMAG 1 off.
Okay. BMAG number 1 off now.
13, this is Houston. We'd like you to give us a survey of your displays on MDCs 1 and 2. Give us gage readings and talkbacks. Over.
Okay. We'll start with display number 1.
Okay, Jack. On MDC 1, there's nothing abnormal. All the rate indicators are zero. Ball number 2 is frozen, of course; we lost MAIN B. I've got - Ball number 1 appears to be working normally. Right now I'm sitting at roll 0, pitch 180, and yaw about 13 degrees. I'm going to try and hold 0, 180, and 0.
Okay, Houston. The center panel - I'm looking at the RCS indicator A. We have a package temperature of about 180. Our helium pressure is 3900. I'm looking at fuel pressure of about 180 and percentage of about, I'd say 85 percent. B is about the same, except that that package pressure is 190. On quad C, we're looking about the same, except that the package temperature is 100. On quad D, we're looking at package temperature of 160. All other indications are about the same. CM pressure - RCS pressure is looking nominal. Helium pressure's up around 4000. And package temperature is about - a little less than 80 on ring 1 and about the same on ring 2.
And the - talkbacks on the SM RCS, I've got HELIUM 1 now are all gray. HELIUM 2 are all gray. PRIMARY PROPELLANT all gray. SECONDARY PROPELLANT, I've got two barber pole, and A is barber pole, B gray, C barber pole, and D gray. Okay. On the ECS RADIATORS, barber pole is gray. On the - On the ECS, PRIMARY INDICATOR.
Okay, Jack. Starting at the top. Okay. The CRYO TANKS; H<sub>2</sub> 1 is reading 230 and the same for 2. Our O<sub>2</sub> CRYO TANK 1 is - looks like it's barely holding its own at 300. And, CRYO TANK 2 is reading zip. Our quantities: H<sub>2</sub> 1 is reading 73, 2, 74. On the O<sub>2</sub> side, we're reading O<sub>2</sub> 1 at quantity, 76; O<sub>2</sub> pegged to full scale high. RAD TEMPs PRIMARY INLET, we're reading about 55; RAD OUT is reading about 30, and the SECONDARY OUTLET is reading - reading 52 degrees. And the EVAP OUT TEMP is 45, STEAM PRESSURE 0.17, and GLYCOL DISCHARGE 48. SUIT COMPRESSOR is reading zip. The ACCUM is reading 30; H<sub>2</sub>O WASTE is reading about 34; POTABLE's reading about 98; SECONDARY RAD INLET is reading about 71; and the RAD OUT is about 30; GLYCOL EVAP TEMP is reading 65, STEAM PRESSURE pegged full scale high; DISCHARGE PRESSURE 9 psi.
Excuse me, Fred; I'd like to butt in here a minute. We'd like to have THRUSTER C-1 off.
C-1 is off.
And proceed - -
Okay - -
- - my last copy is SECONDARY RAD IN.
Okay. Your SECONDARY RAD IN, I gave to you 70 - about 72 degrees; the RAD OUT is about 30; the GLYCOL EVAP TEMP is reading about 65; STEAM PRESSURE full scale high, GLYCOL DISCHARGE PRESSURE about 9 psi. The ACCUM - SECONDARY ACCUMULATOR is about 30 - 34 percent. Our temperatures: SUITS showing about 52 degrees; CABIN about 58 degrees; pressures, SUIT reading 4.1, CABIN at 5. PARTIAL PRESSURE CO<sub>2</sub> is up to little over 1, about 1.1. On the SPS side of the house, the temperature is 72 degrees, helium's reading 3500; N<sub>2</sub> A is reading 2300; N<sub>2</sub> B about 2450. And our ullage pressures: FUEL is reading about 165; OXIDIZER 170. Fuel cells: FUEL CELL 1, both CLOSED, they're zip; SKIN TEMP 405 degrees; CONDENSE EXHAUST is lower scale. FUEL CELL 2 - right now we've got an O<sub>2</sub> or an H<sub>2</sub> FLOW reading of 0.13 to 0.14, and the O<sub>2</sub> FLOW is right now pegged full scale high although it has been varying depending on thruster activity which has also given us MAIN BUS A under volts from a steady reading of about 1.1 up to full scale high. The T<sub>SKIN</sub> is about 445 and the CONDENSOR EXHAUST 17, correction, 180. Let's see if you want it on the DC indicator: FUEL CELL 1 is 0 amps; 2 is reading somewhere between 44 and about - oscillating 44 to 48 again depending on thruster activity.
Stand by.
- - is 0 amps. Say again, Jack.
Houston, 13.
Hello, Houston; Apollo 13. How do you read?
Okay, 13. This is Houston. It appears to us that we're losing O<sub>2</sub> flow through fuel cell 3. So, we want you to close the REAC valve on fuel cell 3. It looks like fuel cell 1 and 2 are trying to hold up okay. You copy?
Are you saying fuel cell 1 and 2 - 1 and 2 are trying to hold up but we're leaking O<sub>2</sub> out of fuel cell 3? And you want me to shut the REAC valve on fuel cell 3? Did I hear you right?
That's affirmative. Close the REAC valve on fuel cell 3.
Okay. I'll go to the SSR page. Do you want me to go through that whole smash for fuel cell shutdown? Is that correct?
Stand by.
Okay, 13. We want you to turn the inline heaters off on fuel cell 1. Then we want you to go through the fuel cell shutdown procedure on fuel cell 3. Read back.
Okay. Shut down the inline heater on fuel cell 1. We're proceeding with the shutdown, special subroutine, for fuel cell 3.
That's affirmative.
13. OMNI Bravo, please.
13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. You got OMNI Bravo and we'd like to have you verify that the tape recorder is off please.
That's verified. Okay, Jack. I'm sitting here with an 0618 showing and I can't get rid of it. Oh, stand by just a - -
Okay. Fuel cell 3 REACs off, Houston.
Roger, Jim. Thank you.
Okay, Jack. Step 2, special subroutine 1 for the fuel cell procedure, has been completed.
Roger. Thank you.
Okay. Jack. I'd like to bring on jet A-4. I've got null on negative pitch control, and - negative pitch control, and right now neither DIRECT or AUTO coils.
Okay. You say no pitch in either DIRECT or AUTO? You want to bring on A-4?
Yes. I've got a positive pitch rate and I can't stop it.
Okay.
Okay, Jack. Bring A-4 on; stop the pitch rate.
Okay. That got it.
And, 13, we need OMNI Charlie, please.
OMNI Charlie.
And, Fred, we would like to have you verify fuel cell reactants talkback is barber pole.
That's affirm. I watched it and it went barber pole as I threw the switch.
Roger.
Okay. Jack. Let me give you a thruster configuration right now. Able 1, Charlie 1, Able 2 are off. Charlie 2, MAIN A, all the thrusters that I call that are on are on MAIN A. Baker 1 off. Dog 1 on, Baker 2 off, Dog 2 on. Able 3, Charlie 3, Able 4, Charlie 4 on. Baker 3 off, Dog 3 on, Baker 4 off, Dog 4 on.
Okay, Jack. That thruster configuration looks okay.
All right. Okay. Do you want some readings from the systems test meter regarding fuel cells?
Stand by 1 on that, Jack. Let me ask the EECOM.
We've got some incompatibilities here.
Okay, 13. We'd like to have you give us those systems test readings on fuel cell 1 and 3, please.
Okay. 1 and 3 coming up.
Okay. Jack, 1-A is reading, lower scale, 0; 1-B is reading. 3.45. Okay. You only want fuel cells 1 and 3. Okay. Ignore that 1-B reading. 1-C is reading 3.4. Now, 1-D is reading 2.4. 2-D is reading 0.25.
Roger, Is that 2 Bravo, Fred?
That's 2 Bravo is reading - oh, about 0.25 to 0.3.
Okay. 2-C is reading 4.1.
And 3-A is reading 4.0.
Roger. 4.0. Say again what it is, please.
3 Able, 3-A.
3-B is reading 1.8.
And 3-D is reading 1.95.
And, Houston, 13. O<sub>2</sub> tank pressure number 1 is less than 300 now.
Roger. We're seeing that. We confirm it.
13, Houston. We're going to have to have you go through the shutdown procedure on fuel cell 1. Our O<sub>2</sub> pressure is going down as you note and the temperature confirms it. Did you copy?
Okay. Well, what bus configuration - What main bus do you want powered?
Okay, Jack. We want you to leave the bus configuration as it is. Fuel cell 2 on MAIN A, and we need OMNI Bravo.
Okay, Jack. We're proceeding on the shutdown procedure for fuel cell 1.
And, 13, Houston. We'd like you to isolate the REPRESS package, please.
Okay.
Isolate the REPRESS package. Roger.
I can confirm REPRESS package is off.
Roger. So now you've got the REPRESS package and the surge tank isolated. Is that affirm?
That is Charlie.
Okay. Now, this is - We're ready to close the REACs on fuel cell 1; is that right?
Jack, stand by on the fuel - -
On that last - confirmation. Okay.
Roger. We're - We're giving you one last - -
We want to just get one last confirmation.
Okay, Jack. We're getting that last confirmation. Stand by, please.
Okay.
Okay, 13. We verify that we want you to close down - shut down fuel cell 1, close REACs valve.
Roger - -
Okay.
- - fuel cell 1; close the REACs valve.
Fuel - -
REACs valve on fuel cell 1 is closed.
Okay, Jack. I can confirm step 2. The fuel cell shutdown procedure is complete for fuel cell 1.
Roger.
13, we recommend that you enable BD roll in the DAP. Over.
Okay. Will do - -
BD roll in the DAP.
13, Houston. We're working on the big dish now, so turn the HIGH GAIN POWER switch off, please.
Okay.
Okay, Jack. When we got the loud bang, we got also a restart. Did you copy that? Is - does GUIDO want anything, a VERB 74 or anything done with the CMC?
Stand by.
13, Houston. We're ready with a VERB 74 now, please.
Coming down at you.
Okay, Jack. It looks like O<sub>2</sub> tank 1 pressure is just a hair over 200.
We confirm that here and the temperature also confirms it.
Okay. Does it look like it's still going down?
It's slowly going to zero, and we're starting to think about the LM lifeboat.
Yes. That's what we're thinking about, too. You want me to do a quick P52? It kind of looks like - We've been talking it over, and it kind of looks like we'd probably aline our plats - LM platform with our platform and then power down the CM, and keep the LM powered up doing a DPS - whatever DPS burns you give us?
13, we're not going to concern ourselves at the moment with a DPS burn. It's going to be some time before we'd get to that; but we're working on other procedures to give you, which will allow us to use the LM systems. Over.
Okay. Real fine.
Apollo 13, Houston. We'd like to charge battery A now.
Charge battery A. Roger.
And, Jack, in regard to your question about the P52 and LM platform, it's - There's no need to worry about that now. We wouldn't be using the LM platform for - until about 79 hours, so let's go as is on the platform for now. Over.
Okay. We understand.
Okay, Jack.
And, Jack, we've turned off the waste dump heater. If you're going to consider dumping any more waste water, we probably ought to do it while the duct is warm there.
Roger. Stand by, Jack.
Okay.
Okay, Jack. Let's keep the water; no need for a dump right now.
All right.
13, Houston. We see the PROP ISOL valve on RCS quad Charlie closed, so we'd like to also disable AUTO RCS feature in quad Charlie.
You want to isolate the AUTO RCS features in quad Charlie?
Affirmative.
Okay, Jack. I didn't plan to reset that quad Charlie DROP ISOL valve. Do you want me to do that? Okay. We just tried it and quad Alfa and Charlie barber poles are showing.
Stand by, Jim.
Okay, Jack. That's the sec - secondary propellant barber poles on Alfa and Charlie.
13, Houston. It won't do any good to try to power the propellant valves on A and C, so we want you to disable the AUTO on RCS Charlie. And we have a procedure for getting power from the LM we'd like you to copy down.
Okay.
Stand by, Jack.
That sounds like good news.
Okay, Jack. About how long is it?
It's not a very long procedure, Fred. We figure we've got about 15 minutes' worth of power left in the command module, so we want you to start getting over in the LM and getting some power on that. And, you ready to copy your procedure?
Okay.
Okay. In the CSM.
Stand by.
Go ahead.
Okay. In the CSM on panel 5, circuit breakers LM POWER 1 and 2, OPEN. Then LM POWER switch, reset and release. In the LM, on panel 11 and panel 16, TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE. Both circuit breakers CLOSE. On panel 16, circuit breaker ASCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSE. On 16, DESCENT ECA CONTROL, CLOSE. On panel 14, put your BAT 5 NORMAL feed ON. BATs 1, 2, 3, and 4 LOW VOLTAGE taps, ON. BAT 5 NORMAL feed, OFF. ASCENT ECA CONTROL, OPEN. You copy?
Stand by 1.
Okay. In the CSM, on panel 5, we want CB LM POWER 1 and 2, OPEN. Then the LM POWER switch to reset, release. In the LM, panels 11 and 16, X LUNAR BUS TIE breakers closed. On panel 16, the ASCENT ECA CONTROL closed; the DESCENT ECA CONTROL closed. On panel 14, BAT 5 NORMAL feed ON, followed by BATS 1, 2, 3, and 4 LOW VOLTAGE taps ON. Then BAT 5 NORMAL feed OFF. Then ASCENT ECA CONTROL breaker OPEN.
That's a good readback, Fred.
And, 13, Houston. As a final effort here, we would like you to turn on the fans in tank 2. Over.
Roger. Understand. Turn on the fans in tank 2.
You want the O<sub>2</sub> fans in tank 2, Jack?
That's affirmative, Jim.
O<sub>2</sub> tanks - fans in tank 2 are on.
Roger.
13, Houston. We'd like you to start making your way over to the LM now.
Fred and Jim are in the LM.
Okay, Jack. Thank you.
And, Jack, I got LM power on.
Okay. You still with us, Houston?
Okay, Houston. You read 13?
Reading you loud and clear, Jack. I've got a procedure for - -
Okay.
- - the guys in the LM.
You got another one?
I have an activation procedure. I'd like you to copy it down.
How long is it, Jack?
It's just four lines. Go to Activation 1, do step 3. Go to Activation 11, omit step 1. Do Activation 12, and then go to Activation 13 and do step 1. Do you copy?
Okay. Is that Activation 1? Do step 3. Is that correct?
That's affirmative, Jim.
Activation 11, omit step 1, do the rest. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
Do Activation 12 and Activation 13, step 1. _comment: "PDF transcript says 'Do Activation 1 and...' which we believe is obviously wrong, but should check audio when it becomes available."
That's all correct.
Okay, Jack. Pressure in tank 1 is approaching 100 psi. What's going to be the symptoms of this fuel cell starting to drop off?
Stand by, Jack. We'll get the word on that.
Okay.
And, Jim, when you get to the end of that procedure, we'd also like to have you put the DEMAND REGs to CABIN.
DEMAND REGs to CABIN. Roger.
Jack, was that Activation 1, step 3 only, or all of Activation 1?
That's go all the way down to step 3, Jim.
Activation 1 to step 3. Roger.
Houston, Apollo 13. Never mind.
13, say again, please.
Oh, we were curious about Activation 11 on the VHF.
Omit the VHF.
- - ... Jack. It's got - Okay.
Jack, this is Houston. We want you to keep the IMU up and keep the lights on so you can see in there, and leave battery off - battery A off and, at the appropriate time, we'll put it on MAIN A. And we're going to keep the IMU up so's we can get a coarse aline in the LM.
All right. Real good. Right now, we're charging battery A. Do you want to discontinue that?
Discontinue the charge on battery A, Jack.
Okay, Jack. I discontinued charge on battery A. You give me the call and I'll turn BUS TIE AC on.
Roger. And we want you to keep the lights up and the IMU on.
Okay.
And, Jack, we'd like you to leave the COMM configuration as is until we get COMM with the LM.
Okay.
And, 13, this is Houston. I've got another procedure for the LM. A short one.
Okay. Ready to copy, Jack.
Okay. On panel 11, we'd like you to close the LGC DSKY circuit breaker. Then we want you to go to Activation 25; do steps 1, 2, and 3. Then go to Activation 30, and that will give us a docked IMU coarse aline. Over.
Roger. Panel 11, close LGC circuit breaker. Activation 25, do steps 1, 2, 3, and then do complete Activation 30. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. On panel 11, LGC DSKY circuit breaker closed.
And in the LM, let's go to panel 11 and close the SUIT FAN circuit breaker and get suit fan 1 cranked up.
Okay. Panel 11, close SUIT FAN circuit breaker, and we'll get the suit fan cranked up.
That's affirm.
And, Jack, in the CSM, go to BYPASS on the radiators and turn your GLYCOL PUMP off.
Okay. Pull the BYPASS; GLYCOL PUMP going off.
Roger.
And, 13, in the CSM, we want to verify that all the fuel cell pumps are off, and we want to have you turn off the O<sub>2</sub> fans in the tank 2.
Okay. Tank 2 fans going off. Okay. That leaves me with tank 1 fans on the tank 1 heaters on.
That's affirm.
Fuel cell 2 pump going off now.
Jack, leave them both on in tank 1.
Okay.
13, Houston. We've got AOS on the LM here.
Okay.
And, 13, this is Houston. In the LM, we'd like to have 12, step 3, which is get the batteries on high taps. Over.
Okay.
How you going there? Activation 12, step 3.
Okay. And, Jack, how do you read from Aquarius?
Aquarius, Houston. Say again, please.
Okay. I was just making a COMM check here. I'm on high voltage taps.
Roger. We see them, Fred, and I'm reading you loud and clear.
Okay. Didn't think I'd be back this soon.
Okay. What next, James? Coarse aline?
Do it right. Take your time.
And, Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to, on your alinement, can you continue right on through the fine aline Activation 31? Go right on through step 7. Over.
Okay. You want to go on 31 through step number 7, Jack.
That's affirmative. And, Odyssey, we've got another configuration for you. All 16 RCS AUTO SELECT OFF. All RCS heaters off. Over.
Okay. I can verify all heaters off. Jack, I've got to keep a fairly minimum deadband until I get through this coarse aline.
Roger.
Okay. VERB 41, NOUN 20. Okay. You want plus? Plus or minus? Plus 302.43? Is that right?
Okay. Let me enter it. Okay. What's the next one? Plus 347.78. 347.78. Okay. 081.3. Is that right? ENTER. Okay.
Odyssey, Houston - -
...
- - your battery A on.
Battery A on now.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Houston. Okay. I want you to doublecheck my arithmetic to make sure we got a good coarse aline. The roll CAL angle was minus 2 degrees. The command module angles were 355.57, 167.78, 351.87.
Okay, Jim. We copy the roll CAL at minus 2.0. The command module is 355.57, 167.78, 351.87.
Okay. VERB 41, we've done that. Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Request high bit rate, please.
You want high bit rate?
That's affirmative, Fred. Won't cost us anything.
Odyssey, Houston. We'd like you to, on your COMM configuration, go to PRIMARY POWER AMP OFF, LOW BIT RATE, and DOWNVOICE BACKUP. Over.
And, Aquarius, we need your SUIT GAS DIVERTER to CABIN.
All right. You got it.
Houston. I've gone to PRIMARY POWER AMPLIFIER, OFF, LOW BIT RATE, DOWNVOICE BACKUP.
Okay, Jack. Thank you. And, Aquarius, your arithmetic looks good on the coarse aline, there.
Okay. Okay stand by for an ENTER.
Three -
Get the GET; we need the GET. What is it? What's that? 58? 58:07?
58 what?
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Here are the gimbal angles. Command module, 356.69, 163.42, 346.67. Aquarius is 302.26, 345.92, 011.79. Over.
Okay, Jim. I got command module 356.65, 163.42, 346.67. Aquarius, 302.26, 345.92, 011.78.
That's 011.79.
Say again, please.
The LM middle gimbal is 011.79.
011.79. Got it.
Houston. ... flashing.
Odyssey, Houston. We need a command reset on your - on your COMM, and then we'd like you to power down to CMC, power down the IMU, heaters off on the IMU, but leave the battery A on.
Yes.
Odyssey, Houston.
Ask him if he's ...
Yes.
Are you ...?
Yes.
Houston, this is Odyssey. Go ahead.
Okay, Jim - -
Copy it down.
Okay, Jim. I think I'm reading Jack, now. But what we want him to do is to give us a command reset. And then power down the CMC, power down the IMU, turn the IMU heater off, leave battery A on. Over.
That's just about 80 - in fact, 82 hours out of the two primary cartridges. That's two guys. 44 is what LC8 got. That would be 88 hours. We got a secondary. You're right. We're listening.
Odyssey, Houston.
They can stand it - Go ahead?
Yes, Jack. Did you copy down about the CMC IMU?
Yes, Jack. I read it back twice to you. Command reset, which I've done. I'm about to power down the IMU, power down the CMC, turn the IMU heaters off, leave BAT A on.
That's affirm. Thank you.
Okay. I just got a MASTER ALARM and MAIN BUS A UNDERVOLT. And I'm starting to power down, now. - -
We've lost - The only advantage to doing it early; if we can power back - the LM back down. The only advantage doing it early is you can do a big burn now and a midcourse and then power the LM down. Otherwise, we got to keep the LM powered up clear until we get around the Moon. Plus it would be inside on the burn. I just hope the G&N hangs up on - hangs in on this one - I'd sure hate to do that one manual.
Oh boy.
Odyssey, Houston. Couple circuit breakers for you. On panel 276, on our INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL, open CB number 3 and number 4.
Okay, Houston. Panel 276, INSTRUMENTATION out and reset - -
- - a lot of light.
- - CB-3 and CB-4 are open.
What?
That's affirmative, Odyssey. And also get your SCS electronics package and power off, and your FDAI POWER/GPI off, and your AUTO jet SELECT, all 16 off.
Okay. Well, wait a second. Let me - Let me get the CMC power down.
Roger, Jack.
I wonder how much that's going to bring this up, here.
Jack, while he's doing that, copy down what you just said again. I want to write it down.
Aquarius, we need to get your sublimator powered up, Activation page 20 and Activation page 21, step 3. Over.
Roger. Activation page 20 and Activation page 21, step 3, sublimator.
Roger.
That's Activation, page 20? Okay, Jack. Now I have to power down IMU. I have no control at all. I'm going to turn my 16 jets off, Say again the other things you wanted?
Okay, Jack. We'd like you to turn off your O<sub>2</sub> tank 2 heaters and fans. Correction - tank 1. Turn the fans and heaters off.
Okay. And, Jack, can we turn on the FDAI circuit breakers so we could have a ball to see if we go to gimbal lock or not?
Stand by.
Houston, he's going to give a 16 NOUN 20, Jack. And, okay, I've got O<sub>2</sub> heaters and fans off in tank 1.
And, Jack, let me know if you get close to gimbal lock, would you?
Jim, we don't want you to power down the ball in the LM. We wanted you to power down the ball in the CSM.
Jack, they haven't powered down - -
Jack, we don't have the balls powered up in the LM.
I have the CMC and IMU in the command module is powered down. The heaters are out.
And the EVAP flow valve, that's open now, and I've undone my suit hoses here and opened up the suit flow valves; so, we got air flowing in the LM now.
Okay, Jack. Will you say again the SCS items you wanted me to power down?
Okay, Houston. Do you read Odyssey?
Hello, Houston. How do you read?
His gimbal lock and ours are different, Jim.
Apollo 13, Houston. Say again, please. You were cut out.
Okay, Jack. Do you want me to proceed by the SCS powerdown checklist? I did not copy the SCS items you wanted me to power down.
Okay, Odyssey. We want to go SCS ELECTRONICS POWER, OFF.
Okay. It's done.
FDAI POWER/GPI, OFF. AUTO jet SELECT, 16 - -
That's done.
- - OFF. And all your ROTATIONAL CONTROL POWER, OFF.
It's done. ROTATION CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, and AUTO ..., OFF.
Okay, Jack. Tell me there. We need to know when we're getting close to gimbal lock in the LM. We have no balls right now.
Okay. We want you to power up your eight-ball. We want you to get your RCS heaters on. Pressurize the RCS and open up the MAIN SOVs. Over.
Okay, Jack. I got two commander FDAI breakers in, AC and DC, and the two GASTA breakers in AC and DC and next you'll want the RCS heaters all on with the - pressurize the RCS and then the MAIN SOVs open. And I think they're already open.
Roger. And, Fred-o, get the TCA breakers in last. Please.
Roger, Jim. I'm holding open those until you give me a further word anyway. I'm just going to pressurize right now.
Jack, are you reading LM gimbal angles?
- - ... power off, come down here and ... the audio ...
Okay, Aquarius. I have some gyro torquing angles and the Odyssey is powered down, attitude-control-wise, so LM's got attitude control now.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. We want you to know that we got some gyro torquing angles for you. And we want you to tell us when you got attitude control in the LM.
Okay. We're still working on the pressurization. I'm getting Jim on the horn here so he can help out, there.
Roger.
Wonder why.
We got to get this pressurized.
Houston, Aquarius.
Stand by 1, Aquarius, Odyssey. We'd like you to go DIRECT RCS and hold your present attitude out the window until the LM gets RCS powered up. Go ahead, Jim.
Well, that's my question. We're not - Our 16 20 doesn't match our eight-ball here. We went to FDAIs ON, and we don't have our balls completely powered up. There may be a ... and our angles don't look the same and we don't want to go into gimbal lock.
Roger. How far are you from RCS power up - RCS pressurization?
Okay, Jack. I'm right up to where it's MASTER ARM, ON; RCS, FIRE; - -
...
- - both LOGIC POWERs out ... goes into normal circuit-breaker. ... Do you want A in and then I'll fire them?
Okay, 13. You're both talking at once. One at a time, please.
Okay. Who's first?
Close LOGIC POWER A and B, Fred, and pressurize RCS.
Okay.
Go ahead, Odyssey.
Okay. I'm going to try to do the best I can. I've got a one-attitude reference I'm going to fly according to the lunar terminator.
Roger, Jack. Just maintain attitude.
What am I doing? I can't do that, anyway. Let's see, cross feed. Nope. Now, and -
Aquarius, Houston. We'll have to get some AC up so you can get a ball reading. Close your BUS TIE INVERTER circuit breakers, all four of them on panel 11. Close your AC BUS VOLT circuit breaker on panel 11. On panel 16, INVERTER 2, CLOSE. Select inverter 2. Over.
That's been completed, Jack.
Okay. The RCS is pressurized now.
Okay, Jack. Do you want us to proceed right on down the line with the RCS check-out and Activation 37 now?
Stand by, Fred.
Hell, is he still firing up there?
Okay, Fred. Negative on the activation on page 37. Go on to your RCS pressurize and then get your TCA breakers in and go to PGNS attitude hold.
Okay, Jack. How do you read?
Okay, Jim. This is Houston. We want you to load the DAP with 30120.
Load the DAP with 30120. Complete.
Okay. We need to change that CSM weight.
Okay, Aquarius. Your CSM weight is 63400.
And Jack's alive to take control the LM to stay away from gimbal lock. Over.
Affirmative. Take control of the LM. PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD.
We are.
And, Odyssey, request you coordinate with Aquarius on attitude control.
Okay.
Roger.
Okay. I don't see where you're firing these things ...
Oh?
Are you firing anything?
I don't think so.
Okay. I got DIRECT.
And, Aquarius, check you ATCA (PGNS) breaker on panel 11 in.
Say again.
Close, on panel 11, circuit breaker ATCA (PGNS).
ATCA (PGNS). Come on. Let's take it easy now.
Okay. We've got ATCA (PGNS) closed.
Yes.
Is that okay?
Yes.
Okay. Now I'm looking.
... okay ...
How about plus?
No. ...
Okay. It's already open.
Okay. Slow down.
Okay, Jack. We got it.
Yes.
Okay, Jim. How's the attitude control?
Okay, Jack. We've got attitude control now in the LM. We're going to try to rotate up through the bellyband.
Roger.
I like that sound like I got back there.
Odyssey, Houston. I've got a procedure for you.
Okay, Jack. I'm ...
I want to go up this way to get away from that - the radios are powered, huh?
Yes.
Check your antenna?
Okay, Jack. Odyssey is ready to copy.
Okay, Jack. What we want you to do is close the reactants valve on fuel cell 2. Power down your inverters. Power down your battery relay bus. Battery ties, off, and pull your entry circuit breakers, entry battery circuit breakers A, B, and C.
Check the control, and make sure we don't go to gimbal lock, Fred.
Okay, Jack; understand. Close REAC valve circuit breakers in fuel cell 2. Power down inverters. Power down BAT relay bus. BAT TIES, OFF. Power entry and both running circuit breakers A, B, and C. All off.
That's affirmative, Jack. And close the reactant valve on fuel cell 2, there.
Okay. I'll do that, and Jack'll do that other.
Okay, Jack; on fuel cell 2, open circuit it.
Okay. Fuel cell 2 is open circuited. Do you want me to go through the standard shutdown procedure for the REAC valves and -
Odyssey, Houston. All you have to do is close the REACs valve on fuel cell 2.
Okay. CB REACs and vent REAC valves all closed.
Yes.
Yes.
... an hour and a half.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. Odyssey is completely powered down, according to the procedure that you read to Jack.
Roger; we copy. That's where we want to be, Jim.
And, Jack, have you all got good LM data down there now?
That's affirmative, Fred. We're getting good LM data.
Okay. In that case, I think I'll pull out some display breakers and just let you all keep an eye on things.
Roger.
He's turning his lights off now, too.
Stand by 1 on that, Fred.
Okay.
What about these lights up here?
I've got it.
Okay.
Where would you like ...?
...
Oh.
We don't want to lose COMM with him.
I'm watching it.
Aquarius, Houston. Stand by on opening your circuit breakers for displays. We're going to let you know what they are, and I have some gyro torquing angles for you.
Okay. What page is that there gyro torquing?
Okay. What page is the, do we write the gyro torquing angles on there, Jack?
Stand by.
Okay. We're there now, Jim. Jim's got it. Go ahead with the gyro torquing angles.
Okay. We'd like you to proceed with the fine aline and your gyro torquing angles are X plus 003.30, Y plus 024.80, Z minus 015.10. Over.
Okay. I read your gyro torquing angles as plus 003.30, Y is plus 023, I only have four numbers for Y; you'll have to give that one to me again, and Z is minus 015.10. Read Y again, please.
Okay, Jim. X and Z are correct and Y is plus 024.80.
Okay. We read Y as plus 024.80. We'll proceed on Activation 40 to fine aline the platform.
Roger. Okay, Aquarius, proceed as on page 40 with IMU fine aline.
Aquarius, Houston. Can you see any stars out the LM window?
We'll have to wipe them off, Jack. They're coated with water right now.
Can I get a towel?
Yes.
Roger. As soon as you get a chance to - on your position - to take a look, we'd like to know if you can see stars for alinement purposes.
Okay. Jim's going to be in trouble in our present attitude out his side. The Sun's there.
Wait 1.
What have you got? How much you got left in battery A? Okay. I wish I knew what the hell they were thinking right now ... - -
They're talking about powering down and doing a P51 here?
No. They were just thinking about P52 - -
Aquarius, Houston. Negative on the P51. We want to stay just like we are, but we'd like to be able to correlate what you're doing with some simulator work we're going to crank up. And so if you can give us information as to what stars you can see out the window, we can make that correlation.
Would you say one more time? Give me the top two. The top two.
Jim, what we want you to do is go with your current fine aline and disregard the P51. What we're attempting to do is to crank up some LMS simulations to correlate what we can get out your window with what we can get out the LMS window to see if that will help us any. So when you can see some stars, if you can, you think you can recognize them and recognize constellations, please let us know.
Okay. We'll check. Stand by.
Okay. Watch the - -
I'm just glad ...
Okay, stand by.
Okay. Here, unplug this.
Aquarius, Houston. We notice that the O<sub>2</sub> pressure in the ASCENT TANK O<sub>2</sub> is a little high, so we want to use some of it. So close DESCENT O<sub>2</sub> and open ASCENT O<sub>2</sub>, tank 2. Over.
Okay, Jack. Switch now on ASCENT number 2 O<sub>2</sub> tank, DESCENT O<sub>2</sub> is closed.
Roger, Fred.
... that?
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
Reading you 5 square, Jim. Go ahead.
Okay. I'm looking out of Fred's window. I see a lot of particles out there, but a lot of that stuff is still drifting away from us, so a lot of it is flashing in the local vicinity, and I don't recognize any constellations right now, in this particular attitude.
Okay, Jim. If that status changes, please let us know.
Roger. We're continuing to drift. Okay, get your TTCA|TTCAs to roll.
TTCA ...
And, Aquarius; Houston. I've got some circuit breakers you can open to power down displays. In addition, I have a P30 maneuver pad. Over.
Roger. Stand by, Houston. Get the CS - get the pad book.
Get the LM data - get the LM book.
And, say - We're getting the pad book now, Jack - and say the boost on powered up?
Okay. I have some circuit breakers that you can open up in order to power down displays.
Okay. Stand by 1, Jack. I'm going to get my COMM carrier on.
All right, I'll tell you what. Get all the LM stuff. Give me the LM stuff right now. Jack, give me all the LM stuff.
Why?
All right, Jack. Hey, what do you need out of here?
... status.
Here.
Now is there any way they can control this thing with the LM on? Fred-o?
What's that?
Looks like I'm cross-coupling here. I might as well -
Yes, you are. TTCA will give you the best controlling warning.
Yes, and I want to get out of this roll. What if I go to - -
It doesn't matter where the hell you are. ... gimbal lock ... my flashlight or any flashlight.
... down and power down ...
Well, I'm not doing any good here.
Okay, how do you read now, Jack?
OMNI.
Yes, we're on.
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Back on? Yes.
Aquarius, Houston. You're watching the middle gimbal there, aren't you? Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. Go ahead with the breakers first, Jack.
Okay. You watching your middle gimbal there?
Tell them we are.
Your attitude is just straight pitch down, Jim. Okay, you're moving away.
Okay, Fred, I've got six circuit breakers for you.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay, they're all on panel 11. Row 1 under AC BUS B, open HELIUM PQGS for PROPELLANT DISPLAY.
It's OPEN.
On row 2, FLIGHT DISPLAYS, open THRUST, open MISSION TIMER, open RANGE/RANGE RATE, ALTITUDE/ ALTITUDE RATE, and open the AC BUS A RANGE RATE, ALTITUDE/ALTITUDE RATE.
They're OPEN.
Okay. They're all OPEN.
Okay. On row 4, PGNS, SIGNAL STRENGTH DISPLAY.
It's OPEN.
It's OPEN?
Okay. That concludes the powerdown of displays. And I have a P30 pad for you.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. The purpose is a pericynthion plus 2 hours DPS abort. NOUN 33: 079:25:26.48; plus 1633.0, minus 0014.5, minus 0751.5; apogee not applicable, perigee is plus 0020.5; 1797.7, 8:35, 268, 264, plus 16410, minus 00145, minus 07338. COAS is NA. And I have two gimbal trim angles for you which will be updated. Right now, however, we want you to go with pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. Over.
What was that for?
Pitch and yaw, maybe, huh?
Okay, what was the last two things you gave me, a pitch and roll angle for what?
That's for your DPS trim.
Those were gimbal angles for - pitch and yaw.
Oh, Roger. GDAs.
Yes, that's what I mean. Sorry.
Pericynthion plus 2 - Okay, DPS pericynthion plus 2, at 079:25:026.48; plus 1633.0, minus 0014.5, minus 0751.5; HA N slash A, HP plus 0020.5; 1797.7, 8:35, 268, 264, plus 16410, minus 00145, minus 07338 - -
Did we lose the water in the - -
- - N slash A in the COAS, and you gave me GDA angles of pitch 5.86, and you want roll 6.75.
Good readback, Fred.
Yes, lose - get all the little bags you can with water.
Aquarius, Houston. Say again, please.
Okay. We didn't answer back there, Jack. Check to see if you're on VOX.
No.
Neither am I, okay. Why the hell are we maneuvering at all now? Are we still venting?
Well, we're at ATT HOLD for one thing - I mean, we're at MINIMUM IMPULSE.
No, I mean why can't you null them out, somewhere?
Every time I try to - I can't take that doggone roll out. I got to wait until they get around to the bellyband.
Wait a minute. Do you - you fight roll by using the TTCA left right. That's what you need to play with.
Okay. We'll try that. Let me get around though. Let's roll. Let it roll all the way.
Yes, you can't let it roll all the way.
I know. I know. But I mean -
Okay. Then until it's upside down at least, huh?
Yes.
Okay. Well, should I ask him what the return time on that one is? Or are you interested?
Let's get the first things first.
Oh, you don't want to hear. Let me figure some times out here. That's at 79, and what are we at now? About - do we - do we - do we even know any better computer time, do we?
No.
Hey, Jack. Do you still have a mission timer? You don't? Okay.
I'll tell you what. Let's ask - let's ask Houston to give us a mission timer, computer time. They can up link it to us. Okay, hold it.
Go ahead.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
You know, we don't have a - I don't think we have a computer clock going, and why don't you up link that stuff to us?
Roger.
And, Fred-o, I got some fast circuit breakers on panel 16 for you.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. On row 1 under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, SYSTEMS ENGINEER's CROSSPOINTER, OPEN. Under RCS B - -
It's OPEN.
Open the TEMP/PRESS DISPLAY-FLAGS and PQGS/DISPLAYS.
Okay. They're both OPEN.
Okay, Fred. On row 3 under COMM, open DISPLAYS and under ECS, open DISPLAYS.
Okay. COMM DISPLAYS, ECS DISPLAYS, both OPEN.
Okay. And two more. In row 4 under HEATERS, open DISPLAYS and under EPS, open DISPLAYS.
Okay. HEATERS DISPLAY, EPS DISPLAY OPEN. And I've long since had all the lights off, floods, et cetera.
Where are those bags? Where are those bags for weighing water in the PLSS?
Why?
We're going to fill up command module water. We'll ...
Hell, do you need a QD ... Jim. No way to get ours in there. I don't think.
Hey, Jim.
I wonder if one of our water ... jet is. Okay, let's control - What else can we fill up there?
Aquarius, Houston.
We're not - we're not going to - -
We're not going to be able to up link your time because of the IU, and we have a frequency problem there. But what I'd like to do is give you a time to set up on your mission timer and give you a mark and then you can put it into the DSKY from there. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
Wait a minute. Why do we need a mission timer right now, anyway? I mean, that bad, they'd tell us.
Well, I'd rather have a timer going so that we - what are we going to put in the DSKY? Should we shut down the mission timer?
Is that what you want to do?
Yes. Hey, OMNI.
Great.
Switch them. Okay. Let's fire on the mission timer.
Aquarius, we need FORWARD OMNI.
FORWARD OMNI.
Say again, Jack.
FORWARD OMNI.
I am. Okay, Houston. If that call was an OMNI switch, I'm in FORWARD now.
Okay, Fred-o, how do I get the mission timer up? I got the mission timer cranked in.
You got it on?
I got the mission timer circuit breaker in.
Okay. We're going to probably need NUMERICS LIGHTING. There you go. You got it.
Aquarius, Houston. I think we've got a better way of getting your mission time up.
Go ahead with it.
Okay. We can do a VERB 55, ENTER, and then put an R<sub>1</sub>, minus 00088. In R<sub>2</sub>, minus 00059; R<sub>3</sub> minus 03274.
Watch the crapping attitude.
We're okay.
God damn. I wish you'd get to something I know.
Well, as soon as we get over here, we'll stop it with the TTCA.
Okay.
And, Aquarius; Houston. We've got you both on VOX.
Like to go what?
You want us on VOX, Jack?
We have you on VOX. We're reading you loud and clear and the clock took good.
Okay. Looks like we're on the FDA route there, Jack.
Okay, Jack. How do you read me on NORMAL VOICE now?
Reading you 5 square, Fred.
Okay.
And, Aquarius, we're ready for a VERB 74 when you can give it to us.
You got it.
Okay. And one other thing we noticed. When you pressurized the RCS, we got an increase in pressure in the ascent tanks, and so we want to have you verify that the ascent feeds are closed. In order to do that, on panel 11, close the ASCENT FEED 1 and 2 circuit breakers on - and cycle the Parker valves, and then open the ASCENT FEED circuit breakers on panel 11.
Completed, Houston.
Okay, Jim. Thank you.
And, Jack, Aquarius. What kind of return time is this maneuver given?
That puts you back in the water at 133 hours.
133, hey.
Affirm.
And that's an Atlantic landing site.
Atlantic landing?
Affirmative. That's the pad that we've given you, but we may change our mind later on. We want you to have this info for now. And that's a minimum - -
Okay.
- - minimum time return.
Aquarius, Houston. We've got to change the REFSMMAT to the one to which you're alined. So we'd like to have P00 and DATA and we'll ship that up to you.
Roger.
Okay, you got it, Jack.
Roger. Coming up.
Aquarius, could you give us DATA please?
Okay, Jack, you got it.
- - the updata link, the DUA breaker may not be in, Jack.
Okay, Fred, and close the DUA breaker.
It's in now, Jack.
Okay, Jim, and it's coming up now. Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston. We're finished with the uplink. The computer's yours. We'd like to power down the DUA, so pull the DUA circuit breaker please.
Okay. Updata link breaker's coming OPEN.
Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to have AFT OMNI, and we're going to lose contact with you for about a minute here while we try to establish tracking. And our latest data shows that your closest approach to the Moon is going to be 60 miles perigee. Over.
Okay. Closest approach, 60 miles, and I'm sitting on AFT OMNI now.
Roger. We'll probably be going off the air here in about a minute.
Houston, Aquarius. Over.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. We're thinking about rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch. We're thinking about rigging up the urine dump to the side hatch and save urine heater power. What do you think?
Stand by 1.
Better still so we won't freeze up our urine dump.
Roger. That sounds like a good plan, Jim. Why don't you go ahead with that one?
Okay, Aquarius. And down here we're getting regrouped, trying to work on your control modes and trying to set up something for PTC and taking a look at consumables as opposed to flight plan, and so forth, and as soon as we get all that information, we'll pass it up to you. We also have the 14 backup crew over in the simulators looking at dock burns and also trying to see what kind of alinement procedures they can come up with for looking at stars out the window. So if you ever are able to see any stars out there and think you can do an alinement out the window, why let us know.
Okay. Jack, right now we're not able to. The sunlight's reflecting off the thrusters and whatever debris came away at the time of the mishap is still with us, such that the stars are hard to find, and why - what respect do you want us to do the stars out the window - just to check the LMS run, is that correct?
That's affirmative. We'd like to correlate the information we get with your's, so that if we can use it to update the platform, we can. What we're really trying to do, Jim, is see if we can do a COAS aline so we can power down the platform.
That is Aquarius. We're getting an awful lot of static on the uplink now, and we're not reading you at all.
I have good signal strength and I'm on AFT OMNI.
How do you read now, Aquarius?
Hey, Jim, do you suppose that you could orient the LM so that the service module would be between you and the Sun? I believe you could see - recognize constellations out your front windows then.
Aquarius, Houston. Radio check.
Okay, Jack. How do you read now?
Okay. Hearing you 5 square now, Jim. And the question we have, is there some way you can orient the spacecraft so that the service module is between the LM and the Sun so you can recognize constellations out the window? And secondly, can you see anything out the AOT?
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
Aquarius, how do you read me now?
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
Aquarius, request FORWARD OMNI, please.
Aquarius, Houston. Request FORWARD OMNI. How do you read?
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
Hello there, Aquarius. Loud and clear. How do you read me?
There's an awful lot of background - -
We get a lot of background static, Jack. You're down in the mud. You having a ground problem?
What we tried to do was to get the IU frequency shifted off a little bit so that we'd have less interference. I think it'll come up - What we want you to do is turn on your descent oxygen and turn off your ascent oxygen. Over. And request FORWARD OMNI.
You're unreadable, Jack. We've got our signal strength meter - right now it keeps wavering up and down, and the best I'm getting is about 2.4 AGC.
Roger. Request FORWARD OMNI.
I am on FORWARD OMNI. I've been on FORWARD OMNI.
Okay. How do you read, Jack?
I'm hearing you 5 square, Fred. How me?
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
Okay. We're up to about 2.6 AGC now.
Aquarius, Houston. Radio check.
Okay. Every time you transmit, Jack, the AGC starts to drop off and the static level turns up.
Okay, Fred. You're loud and clear.
I wish you were.
Fred, go to DESCENT O<sub>2</sub>.
DESCENT O<sub>2</sub>. Roger.
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Hello there, Aquarius. How do you read me now?
Hello, Houston. Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
Okay. That's the first clear word we heard from you, Jack. Do you think it could be my pitch attitude that's breaking up your incoming? I guess you've been hearing us.
We have been hearing you, and the problem is on the ground. I hope we have it corrected now.
Okay. That sounds good.
We're considering powering down the PGNS but we want to know what capability you have to do a coarse and fine aline. We read your conversation about being unable to see out the window very good. How about out the AOT?
He's looking now.
Okay. And the other thing we thought you might try is to put the service module between you and the Sun and then to see if you can see anything out the window in that attitude.
The reason that we think that that would work is that it worked on Apollo 10. It made the constellations all recognizable when we put the the service module - in our case a LM, between us and the Sun.
AFT OMNI, Fred.
You're down in the mud again, Jack. It appears that some other circuit is feeding through on there with you.
Roger. AFT OMNI.
Aquarius, AFT OMNI.
Okay. You're down in the mud again, Jack. Lots of background static.
AFT OMNI, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
Hello, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
Hello, there, Aquarius. Loud and clear. How me, now?
Okay, we're reading you loud and clear, Jack. I hope it stays this time.
Okay. We'd like to brief you on what our plan is. We're, at this time, water critical in the LM. So we'd like to use as little as possible. To do this, we're going to plan to make a free-return maneuver of 16 feet per second at 61 hours, which is 37 minutes from now. Then we're going to power down the PGNS, and then we'll - at 79 hours, we'll go ahead and make another abort maneuver to kick what we got. But we'd like to get that PGNS powered down as soon as possible. That would be after the midcourse and - so how do you feel about making a 16-foot-per-second burn in 37 minutes?
Well, we'll give it a try, Jack, if that's all we've got. That's a 16-foot-per-second DPS burn in 37 minutes?
Roger. We're working up a pad for it, but we'd want to know what you think about doing it at that time.
Well, we'll do it. Could you give us a little bit more time?
Okay, Jim. We'd like to get a suggested time from you. We can figure out a free-return maneuver for any time you want to give us, so if you'll give us the time you'd like to shoot for, we'll figure out a pad.
Okay, that sounds good. I think if we have a little bit more time; we want to do it right. Stand by 1.
Let's shoot for an hour if we can, Jack. How's that.
Okay, Jim. How about 61 hours and 30 minutes? That's an hour and 5 from now.
Okay. We'll do it and we want to be sure we talk back and forth now to make sure we get this burn off right.
Affirm.
Okay, in the interim, Jack, I looked around again and I saw that we have a radar and a landing-radar heater breaker in. Can I pull those out?
Affirmative. Pull them both out.
And now we want to ask you a question about alinements, and so forth. We wanted to know if you can see any stars out of the AOT. We also wanted to know if you could use the service module to cast a shadow on the LM windows and then look out the windows to see stars for a PS1 COAS alinement.
Okay, in this attitude, Jack, that we're pitching around, I cannot use the AOT to see stars. We - we're just not able to see them at all. Now we may be able to maneuver off in yaw or - and/or roll and see stars. Right now, we haven't been able to. The AOT is useless. The command module structure is just radiating too much light into the - into the telescope.
Okay, and how about using the service module to cast a shadow on the commander's window? If you do that, can you see stars for a COAS alinement?
We could give that a try, Jack, although I don't know how successful it will be. We tried to do it - The light shines off our quads which makes it difficult to see stars. We do have the Earth and the Moon, if that can be of assistance.
Another problem - Right now, Jack, I'm looking out the right window and it's pretty dark out that window but there are about a thousand or so false stars out here from - left over from some of the debris. It's hard to discern what's real and not real.
Okay. That's good information and during the time that we see you're continuing to pitch, if you ever get in a position where you think the AOT might be of some use, we'd like you to periodically look out of it and see if you can see some stars that would enable us to get a P52.
Okay, will do. And also, let me ask you a question. In this configuration, docked, we have to use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. And, just how much can we use that without really changing our trajectory? We only have 60 miles to play with.
Roger, we'll put that to them.
Okay, Jack, are you ready to go to work with me on the 2-hour DPS activation and contingency book, page 1?
Roger, we're ready to go.
Okay. Item one, we can - one through five, we can scratch off, as done. Is that correct?
Stand by 1, Fred.
Okay, Fred, let's go ahead. Step 1, page 1. Everybody's listening.
Okay, I've looked around, and I've essentially done steps 1 through 5 with the exception of floodlights and utility lights and I think we'll just do without those.
Roger. Your choice.
Okay, on EPS activation, we're through step - we're through that - bottom of that page. That's all done.
We concur, page 2.
Okay, in essence, we've circumvented step 4, and we're not sitting with all 4 aps - descent BATs on high-voltage taps, so I'll scratch off step 4.
Roger, and in step 5, we want to leave INVERTER 1 circuit breaker OPEN.
Roger. In step 5, we'll leave INVERTER 1 CB OPEN.
Omit step 6.
Okay, for the time being, our mission timer is the computer so, mission timer activation scratch off.
Roger.
Okay. We've done the primary glycol loop activation.
We verify it.
Aquarius, we recommend you leave the caution and warning off on page 3.
Okay. I was going to say that next. Page 3, we'll just scratch item 1. And item 2, I've already got the RCS heaters on. And I don't know if I gave you the time or you got the time on the PRIMARY EVAP FLOW number 1, OPEN.
We got the time.
Okay. Let's go to the CB pages now.
Fred-o, did you close the engine control breaker in panel 11?
What control is that, Jack?
Did you close the S and C engine control breaker on panel 11? As we got step 1 there on page 3.
Okay. Okay, yes, the EPS DESCENT ECA CONTROL breaker is CLOSED on 11.
Roger, and how about the - on panel 11, S and C ENGINE CONTROL, CLOSED? AFT OMNI, Fred.
Okay. We're AFT OMNI, and we have the S and C ENGINE CONTROL breaker CLOSED.
Roger. Let's go on with the circuit breaker panel checkout.
Okay. I'll just give you - I think it'll be easier to give you what I got in. Okay, in the top row on 11, we have the four AC BUS TIE breakers IN and the AC BUS VOLTS breaker IN, and that's it. Second row, we have the four TCA breakers IN. We have the GASTA under FLIGHT DISPLAYS and COMMANDER's FDAI. And likewise under AC BUS A, we have a GASTA and a COMMANDER FDAI breaker IN. That's it. On row 3, we have a SIGNAL CONDITIONER 1. We have the ATCA (PGNS). We have the ENGINE CONTROL breaker, ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL breaker, and the - under LIGHTING, ANUN/DOCK/COMPONENT breaker IN. And one other, ED LOGIC POWER A - ED LOGIC POWER A is also IN.
Copy.
Okay, under the fourth - fourth row, we got all the QUAD HEATER breakers IN, SUIT FAN 1. Under ECS, GLYCOL 1 and 2; and under COMM, we have COMMANDER AUDIO IN, and PGNSs LGC/DSKY, IMU STANDBY, IMU OPERATE, and that's it. Okay, in the bottom row, EPS, we have the BAT FEED TIE both IN, and we have the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS IN, the X LUNAR BUS TIE, DESCENT ECA CONTROL, DESCENT ECA, and the DC BUS VOLTs breaker.
Roger. We copy. - -
That completes it for panel 11. Okay. Stand by. Okay.
As I see it, some of the short ones are - we need the DECA GIMBAL in sooner or later.
That's affirmed. Close the DECA GIMBAL.
And probably - Okay, DECA GIMBAL, and sooner or later, we're going to need DECA POWER, I guess, also.
All right, DECA POWER will come up later in the procedure, Fred-o.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. On your circuit breaker checklist, on panel 11 and 16, we want you to configure the panels as outlined in the checklist.
Okay. You want us to configure as per checklist. Okay. We'll do that.
That's right. Close the black ones and open the white ones.
Yes. I think we can manage that.
With the activation power up, we're starting right now.
Houston, we might as well leave our RCS TCAs IN, right?
Affirmative, Jim. Leave your RCS TCAs in - -
Check that - -
- - on panel 11.
- - Yes. I used my Pentel pen and made those white ones black ones.
Roger. Same on 16, Fred.
Roger.
And you might look there, Houston, to see what circuit breakers aren't required, like the tape recorder.
We're looking.
Okay, Jim. On panel 11 over there, you can also leave open the RENDEZVOUS HEATER breaker and the LANDING RADAR HEATER breaker, in addition to the tape recorder.
They're out.
I'm leaving a few in, Jack, too, like the SUIT FAN 1 is still IN, RCS SYSTEM is still IN, the TCAs. ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL is IN.
Roger.
How about if I leave the VHF A and B OFF?
Switch to FORWARD OMNI.
Okay. We can leave the VHF powered down, too.
And, do you want the SECONDARY S-BAND?
Negative on SECONDARY S-BAND. Leave them open.
UP DATA LINK is IN. Do you want that in or out?
Leave the UP DATA LINK open. We'll call for it when we want you to put it in.
Okay, Jack, on panel 11 on the top row, do you really want the PROPULSION PQGS and ASCENT HELIUM REGs in?
And, also the SYSTEM ENGINEER X- POINTER breaker.
Roger. Negative on the PQGS. Negative on the ASCENT HELIUM REG, and negative on the CROSS-POINTER.
Okay. On the second row, I'm going to leave the FLOODLIGHT breaker open.
Concur.
And we're again up to - Do you want the CWEA enabled?
Negative on the CWEA.
Okay.
Okay. Since we're - are we going to power up the AGS or should I concern myself with the ATCA breaker?
Negative on the AGS. However, Fred, we need the ATCA breaker in.
Okay. ATCA breakers IN. Yes. I guess for the backup power supply. Hey, how about ATCA AGS.
Negative on ATCA AGS.
And I'm leaving the SUIT FLOW CONTROL breaker open.
Let's close the SUIT FLOW CONTROL breaker - -
And, now ...
- - so it doesn't take any current.
Okay. Without suits, it doesn't do us much good either though.
Okay. And are we going to continue to be able to operate off the OMNIs, Jack. So can I leave the S-band antenna powered down?
Okay, Fred-o. We don't plan to use the steerable antenna, although we want to leave the heaters on. So it looks you ought to open up COMM S-BAND ANTENNA, but leave S-BAND ANTENNA HEATERS closed.
Roger. COMM S-BAND is OPEN, S-BAND HEATER breaker is still CLOSED.
And, on the bottom row, Jack, I'm going to leave the HEATER DISPLAY breaker out, which we had pulled before, and EPS DISPLAY. But I question, do we want the ASCENT ECA breaker in, as prescribed?
Stand by. That's a negative on the ASCENT ECA breaker. Leave it open.
And, Aquarius, we need P00 and DATA - -
And that's a - -
- - and we'll give you state vector and target load.
Okay. We need the UP LINK breaker in then now.
That's affirmative.
Okay. And, Jack, will you give us that - how about the ORDEAL breaker? Can I pull that? We don't need that, do we?
Negative on the ORDEAL. Leave it open.
And how about the ASCENT ECA breaker on panel 11? Jim has it in over there.
And panel 11 ASCENT ECA can be open.
It's open.
Okay, Aquarius. We're GO on the circuit breaker configuration as you have it now.
Roger.
And, Aquarius, tests in the simulator just showed that if you want to let the PGNS DAP hold your attitude for you, it will.
Okay, very well.
And, Jack, because it will take quite a while to get back to the attitude, I think we ought to think about going there very shortly.
Roger. I have a pad for you. I have a P30 maneuver pad.
Roger. Stand by.
... - -
Go right ahead, Jack.
Okay. We want you to hold your maneuver until we finish making the load. We haven't completed it yet. Are you ready to copy P30 maneuver pad?
That's affirm.
Okay. Here we go. The purpose is midcourse correction for free return. NOUN 33: 061:29:42.84; minus 0021.3, plus 0004.1, minus 0031.2; HA and HP are NA; DELTA-V 0038.0; 031, 120, 298, minus 00213, plus 00041, minus 00312; COAS NA. And I have your LM GDA angles. Pitch 5.86, roll 6.75. Your DPS throttling, 5 seconds at 10 percent, burn the rest at 40 percent. Your ullage will be two jets for 10 seconds.
Okay, Jack, we have a P30 maneuver pad, a midcourse for free return. NOUN 33: 061:29:42.84; minus 0021.3, plus 004.1, minus 0031.2; HA and HP N/A; DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> 0038.0; 031, 120, 298; minus 00213, plus 00041, minus 00312. COAS N/A; GDA angles; pitch 5.86, roll 6.75; DPS throttle 5 seconds at 10 percent; burn the rest at 40 percent. And we need a two-jet, 10-second ullage.
That's a good readback, Fred. I'd like to verify, however, in NOUN 81, in V<sub>Y</sub>, it's plus three balls 41.
Okay. NOUN 81, V<sub>Y</sub> is plus 0004.1.
Good readback. Let's press on with the checklist.
Okay. And, Jack, find out about using TTCA to maneuver with.
Okay. We're finished with the computer, it's yours, and we recommend using the TTCA to maneuver with.
Roger.
Okay, I'm back on the checklist, page 6. Jack, under PGNS turn-on and self-test. We've done everything except the self test here on this page. Do you want to do that at this time?
Okay. Aquarius, negative on the PGNS self test.
Okay. I'll scratch page 6 and on page 7, we're not going to activate the - or rather we had the S-band activated, ECS Activation I have all done. And, at the bottom of the page, the docked IMU coarse aline is done.
Roger.
We've - Okay, we've also completed, I guess in essence, all of page 8.
That's affirmative and page 9 to boot. Scratch VHF. We've done the T<sub>ephems</sub>.
Okay. You've updated it, that's right. We cranked in the time.
And, Houston, let's go to activation - or get into page 10 and see what we did there.
Okay. The only item on page 10 is to deploy the landing gear.
Okay, we'll do that now.
Okay. The landing gear are down and locked, Jack, and looking ahead now at page 11, we've done all of that.
We verify that. Page 12.
Okay, and I assume in amongst all those numbers you pumped up, we got a REFSMMAT and STATE VECTOR, is that correct?
That's affirmative. You've got that. So you can delete page 12.
Hey, on 13, you've read us up the fine aline angles and we've cranked those in.
Affirmative.
Okay, so now we're up to - we've got to do DAP set, the gimbal/throttle test.
That's - Okay, Aquarius. We recommend omitting the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test - just make sure the gim - DECA POWER and DECA GIMBAL circuit breakers are closed.
Okay, we're going to proceed now with the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test, is that correct? Or did you say delete it?
Aquarius, delete the DAP set, gimbal/throttle test. Just ensure that the DECA POWER and the DECA GIMBAL are closed.
Okay. Houston, DECA POWER is OPEN at this time. Do you want me to close it?
Affirmative, Jim. Close the DECA POWER.
It's CLOSED. We deleted that.
Okay. Also out of that list, Jack, we need the COMMANDER's THROTTLE set to THROTTLE and MIN.
Houston, if I recall the launch set of the gimbals, the GDAs are not correct here, and where are we going to get those set for the burn?
Stand by 1.
Okay. Here's the word on the DAP set, gimbal/ throttle test. Let's do step 1 and step 2, and that'll get our gimbal set.
Roger.
Okay, Jack, we're going to have to back up on this, if we're going to follow the procedure here, which has us go MODE CONTROL; PGNS, AUTO, we're going to have to pull the TCA breakers to keep from firing jets.
Stand by, Fred.
Stand by on step 1, Fred. We're getting the word for you. How do you like this SIM?
It's a beauty.
Okay, Aquarius, we recommend you do the DAP set and gimbal/throttle test as per the checklist. Go PGNS AUTO and proceed.
Well, we're going to fire our thrusters as soon as we go to AUTO because we've got those thrusters in - the thruster circuit breakers. Do you want us to do that and stop?
Okay, Aquarius, we're recommending you go to AUTO. Let the thrusters fire and settle down and proceed with the test.
We're in PGNS AUTO.
Roger, your DAP is set, you're in wide deadband. That ought to do the trick.
Roger.
Okay, we're looking at it, Aquarius. We're ready to proceed with the test.
Okay, we're proceeding.
Okay, and Houston, you - you're looking at the weights now. Those are still good, right?
You're GO on the weights.
Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to recycle on the DAP load and change your DAP to 32021. Over.
Okay, Aquarius. We're looking at your gimbal and we notice that we got a four-jet ullage loaded in the DAP and we gave you two jets on the pad. But, let's go with what we've got loaded. It'll be a four-jet ullage.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. How does the GDAs look now?
The GDAs are GO as they are. Press on.
Okay, Houston, we're going to do the DPS pressurization and checkout.
Stand by 1.
Okay, your gimbals are within 0.3 and we're ready for the DPS pressurization and checkout.
Okay, Houston, do you want to follow up on page 15 with RCS checkout? In essence, we've kind of already done that.
You're right, Aquarius. Let's delete the RCS checkout. And a DPS looks GO.
Houston, we're going to do a PGNS AUTO maneuver to the attitude.
Stand by on that. Aquarius, we recommend driving it around there manually with a TTCA.
Okay, we'll have to use the TTCA. Roger.
We're going to AUTO now, Houston, to try to damp the rates. We're at the attitude.
Roger, Jim. We verify the attitude.
Roger.
And, Houston, we'd like to confirm, do you want the VERB 65 ENTER in there?
Affirmative on the VERB 65.
Okay.
Okay, Jack. I got another question on page 18. At 1 minute, I concur with MASTER ARM ON, but I wonder why I have to have the ABORT STAGE breaker in. We sure don't want any staging now.
Aquarius, delete the ABORT STAGE circuit breaker CLOSE. Leave it open.
Roger. Will delete.
Okay. Also, Jack, since we have four-jet ullage versus two, do you want - still want 10 seconds ullage or do you want 5 now?
Okay, Aquarius, we'll use automatic ullage.
Okay. We'll just let the 7-1/2-second AUTO ullage do it.
Roger, and we'd like to do this in manual throttle, so on page 17 about two-thirds of the way down, THROTTLE CONTROL, MANUAL, vice AUTO.
Okay. We're set to MANUAL.
What's the 203 ... ?
ENTER on the 203, Jim.
We've got 203 in the DSKY now and it looks as though it requires work, can we pass it?
Aquarius, ENTER on the 203.
Wait a minute.
Aquarius, we'd like to verify that your throttle is in the MIN position.
That's affirm.
And, in the event that you have to do a manual takeover, turn the ENGINE GIMBAL OFF, MODE CONTROL to ATTITUDE HOLD, and use the hand - use the TTCA.
Roger.
Okay, 1 plus 30 to burn.
Roger.
Okay, MASTER ARM's ON; 1 minute.
Roger, Aquarius. You're GO for the burn.
40 percent.
Okay, Aquarius. You're looking good.
AUTO shutdown.
Okay. You're looking at 1685 now, Jack.
Okay. You're GO in the residuals, proceed.
Okay. When you say GO on the residuals, you mean don't trim them. Is that right?
That's affirmative. No trim required.
Roger.
Okay.
Aquarius, check your MASTER ARM OFF, please.
Okay, Houston. Burn's complete. Now we have to talk about powerdown, and what do you want us to do with the PGNS?
Roger. We're looking at that right now, and you'll be the first one to get the word.
And, Houston, it's doubtful right now whether we'll be able to see the stars in this configuration. The only way we could possibly get alinement is with the Earth and the terminator or the Moon and its terminator and I'd sure like to have you look at a powerdown - keeping the PGNS if at all possible.
Roger, Jim. We'll get the word for you.
And, Houston, we're in an ATT HOLD mode, can we turn off the buses?
Stand by on that one, Jim.
Okay, Aquarius. We're working on what's going to happen next. In the meantime, we'd like to take some high-power items off the line, so on panel 11, open DECA POWER, and open DECA GIMBAL. On 16, open the ATCA breaker.
Okay, on 11, we got DECA POWER, DECA GIMBAL, OPEN. On 16, we got the ATCA breaker OPEN.
And, Houston, while you're thinking, see if you can come up with a procedure of perhaps using the command module optics with manual drive to perhaps look for stars.
Roger.
And, Jack, Aquarius. While you're thinking - before we had our COMM problems, we were wanting to know what to - whether we should hook up the side hatch urine dump system. So we wouldn't freeze up the normal urine dump system.
Roger. We gave you a GO on that earlier. Sorry, you must have missed it. Use the side hatch for urine dump.
Okay.
And, how are the stars out the window now?
Well, I'll look again, Jack, but at this attitude, the Sun is reflecting off of - off of quad 4 so bright that it's ruining any night vision and we still got particles floating around us; I'll have to take a long look and see if I can see any star patterns.
Roger. And Aquarius, we're going to have to hand you over to a different site now, and we think maybe things will work better if this time we turn off the S-band transmitter/receiver, and bring it back up in 5 minutes. You copy?
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay. I understand you want us to turn off the S-band transmitter/receiver and bring it up in 5 minutes. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
Tell us when.
And you want us to maintain attitude control.
Affirmative on the attitude control.
That's auto attitude control. Okay. You maintain auto attitude control.
Okay, Jack, I'm back on the line now. On the S-band, you want me to turn off the transmitter/ receiver and the power amps are off for 5 minutes. Is that - when you give me the word - is that what you want?
Aquarius, leave the power amplifier the way it is. Turn the transmitter/receiver off for 5 minutes. Now.
Okay. You tell me - you tell me when.
Okay. Turn it off now. See you in 5 minutes.
Okay. It's gone off. It's gone off for 5 minutes.
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
Okay. You're loud and clear there, Jack.
Roger. Same here. We're - We're still discussing the next move.
I figured it. Let's just make it a good one.
We're looking real close at water usage profiles, and right now things are kind of swinging toward leaving the IMU powered up and powering down the LGC, but we'll have more word for you shortly. And we recommend for sleeping that you leave one guy on watch. We recommend you don't make any urine dumps if you can help it, because it'll make the debris problem worse than it is now. And we have some items that you might want to transfer to the LM, some towels, some penlights, fecal bags, UTS. And do you have any more items that we can help you out with at the moment?
Okay. Stand by on your latter list there, Jack. I understand no urine dumps. I guess we'll work through the UCD and all the bags we got; and real quick there, can you give a DAP load that we want in here now to conserve the RCS.
Okay. For attitude control coordinates, we're recommending manual control VERB 76 and watch your middle gimbal angle. Your DAP load that you have now looks good.
Okay. It's ATT HOLD VERB 76 for the guy on watch. And the DAP load we got right now is okay.
Aquarius, our decision for the time is to leave the IMU powered up, power down the LGC, and power down other nonessential items. We'll be coming up with a more precise checklist as soon as we can get it. Over.
Okay. The decision is to keep the platform, power down the computer, and we'll be standing by for further word on the powerdown, Jack.
Roger.
And, Aquarius, for your information, we now have 136-mile perigee. Confirmed by Doppler.
Okay. 136-mile perigee now. That's very nice.
Oh, wait a minute, Jack. Did you say pericynthion or perigee?
I meant pericynthion.
Ah. That's better.
And, Houston, we pulled out your UPDATA LINK circuit breaker, so if you want to update it for anything, let us know and we'll put it back in.
Roger, Jim. We will.
Aquarius, AFT OMNI, please.
AFT OMNI.
Houston, do you read Apollo 13?
This is Houston. Go ahead. Reading you weakly.
Okay, Jack. We don't want to bug you, but you ought to be thinking - or what your thoughts are concerning what the next burn will be. I got to figure out a watch schedule and the sleep schedule and just how we can meet the next maneuver.
Roger. We're getting you a flight plan update. We're still computing on your next burn, and we're getting ready to give you a procedure for powerdown.
Aquarius, one idea on managing the OMNI antennas. It might make it easier on everybody if we disabled the UPLINK SQUELCH and managed the antennas by switching when we hear the noise. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Okay, Aquarius. Here's what we're going to do. We'd like you to point the LM X-axis either north or south. That's the positive X-axis. It appears to us that it would be closer to orient the LM plus X-axis toward the south. Do that with the LGC powered up using the TTCA. After that, we propose to power down the LGC to save some power. However, this means that we lose the use of the TTCA, and we'll have to control the spacecraft with the hand controller in the DIRECT mode. Request your - your position on these two items.
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
Okay, Jack. Understand. You want us to point the LM X - plus X-axis to the south using the TTCA|TTCAs with the LGC powered up. Then, by powering down the LGC, we'll lose a TTCA. I wasn't too successful in controlling the spacecraft in attitude only, but I might be able to keep it out of gimbal lock.
That's affirmative, Jim. We'd keep your ball powered up and go to DIRECT on the hand controller. And maintain attitude in a DIRECT position.
Okay. Understand; and do you want some sort of a PTC mode, Jack?
Affirmative. We'll take whatever PTC mode you can set up, Jim.
Okay. And since you know our approximate attitude, how about just getting me something to find you on the DSKY for a southerly plus X-direction.
Roger. Stand by 1.
And one other question, Houston. When you say power down the DSKY or the LGC, do you mean going into 06 or multiple circuit breaker?
Stand by on powering down the DSKY, Jim. We'll give you the procedure for that. The procedure that we - -
Okay.
- - the procedure that we have is listed in several places. It's in the Contingency checklist under "Power down" on page 1, second paragraph.
And we'll give you that word when we want you to do that. That's LGC only, not to power down the IMU. But we'd like to have you hold off on that until we send you the word. Over.
Understand.
And, Aquarius, while we're working on this, we have a proposed flight plan update for your working and resting cycles. And - You ready to copy?
Okay. Do you want me to write this in the flight plan, per se, Jack?
You can probably write it on a piece of scratch paper. This is pretty easy.
Okay. Go ahead. We got a lot of scratch paper.
Okay. We're suggesting that the LMP rest while the CMP and CDR are awake. LMP ought to hit the sack at about 63 hours, coming up in 25 minutes. And you get to rest for 6 hours. You get up at 69 hours. At 70 hours, the commander and the command module pilot sleep for 6 hours until 76 hours. Around 70 - 76-1/2 to 77 hours, we'll do a P51 and a 52. At 78:30, we'll load P30 and aline AGS to PGNS. Our ignition time for a second burn will be, presently, 79:25:26.5, and we'll have a pad for you shortly. We suggest that all of you eat after the burn. That'll be 81 to 82 hours. Let the CMP and CDR eat while you are sleeping. And that you grab a bite as soon as you can. Over.
Okay, Jack. As I read that, the LMP is to go to sleep at 63:00 for about 6 hours. During that period, the CDR and CMP should try to get a bite to eat. I'm to awake at 69 hours. CDR and CMP sleep at 70 hours, and they are to awake at 76 hours. And we should plan on doing our P51, P52 at 76 hours or 76:30. At 78:30, we're going to load a P30 and aline AGS to PGNS. Second maneuver is to take place at 79:25:26.5 for ignition time. Then we're all to eat at 81 to 82 hours.
Okay. With a minor modification, your P51, P52 will be about 77 hours, and that's the period of darkness. And the commander and the CMP ought to eat around 68 to 69 hours, and you should eat between 69 to 70 hours just after you get up. We have left an hour in there where everybody is awake together to talk things over. Go ahead.
Okay. I'll eat after I wake up between 69 and 70.
All right we have additional - -
- - and I've got the correction to P - -
Go ahead, Fred.
Yes. We got the word the P51, P52 is going to be done around 77 hours, while we're in darkness.
That's affirmative. And we have a work-rest cycle laid out for further on, which we can relay to you later.
Okay.
Okay. And, Houston, you have advice on what attitude you want me to go to.
Okay. That'll be the next bit of information. I'll get that for you, Jim.
Okay.
And, Aquarius, just to get you thinking in that direction, we've run a fairly thorough analysis, and we've found out that it's going to be cheaper to keep the LGC and the DSKY up and turn the inverter and the ball off. It's going to save us 1 amp and also some water, so it looks like what we're going to do. And we'll have to monitor the middle gimbal angle. And we'll get the procedure on that, and it'll also be an easier control mode where we'll be able to use the TTCA through the - through the DAP.
That sounds great, Jack.
Aquarius, Houston. We've got a procedure for you. Ready to copy?
Ready to copy.
Okay. It's pretty easy. We see you've already got VERB 16 NOUN 20 called up there and so we want you to, in maneuver and PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD, use the TTCA. We want you to, on the commander's ball, pitch to 267.5 and yaw to minus 4.5. And when you do this in VERB 16 NOUN 20, on the DSKY, you ought to read plus 00120, plus 26750, and plus 00450. Go ahead.
Okay. We're to drive the commander's ball to a pitch of 267.5, yaw minus 4.5. And we should have in 16 20 at that time, plus 00120, plus 26750, plus 00450.
That's a good readback. We'll watch the maneuver.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Roger. You didn't mention roll on the ball. Do you want roll zero?
The roll ought to be plus 1.2, Jim.
Roger.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
Okay. We're just about there in pitch and in ... middle gimbal angle, but that other gimbal angle didn't look like it pulled the right way. I tried both methods.
Yes. I been looking at that, too, and we're asking why, and we'll get an answer for you.
Yes. Houston, I wonder if you're accounting for being a bit off the bellyband here, and I've gone through GASTA.
And, Fred-o, I know you're supposed to start sleeping here pretty soon, but we got a new PC plus 2 pad, P30 maneuver pad for you.
Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead, Jack.
Okay, Fred. P30 maneuver purpose is PC plus 2, DPS to this time, we're going to the MPL. And NOUN 33, 079, 27, 4013, plus 08144, minus 00443, minus 02226, apogee is N/A, perigee is plus 00205, 08455, 420, 268, 261, plus 08155, minus 00443, minus 02187, COAS is N/A. Your GDA ought to be okay as it is from the last burn, but pitch ought to be at 5.85; in roll, it's 6.74. Your ullage will be two jets for 10 seconds. Your DPS throttle will be 10 percent for 5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, and the remainder at full throttle. And for your information, this will put you in the water at 142 plus 47. Over.
Okay. DPS, pericynthion plus 2 into the MPL, 079, 27, 4013, plus 08144, minus 00443, minus 00226, N/A, plus 00205, 08455, 4 plus 20, 268, 261, plus 08155, minus 00443, minus 021, 2187, N/A. GDA should be okay as is, which hopefully is pitch 5.85, yaw 6.74. Two-jet ullage for 10 seconds, the DPS throttle 10 percent for 5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, 100 percent for the rest of the burn. And this should put us into the water at 142 plus 47.
Okay, Fred. I have a correction in NOUN 81. DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub> is minus 02226. Read back.
Okay. DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub> in NOUN 81 is minus 02226.
Okay. Good readback.
Somehow that didn't add up with the DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> to give a DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> of that magnitude. It seems like it'd been bigger.
Okay. We'll take another look at it, Fred.
Okay, Houston. I'm not having too much luck holding this particular attitude.
Okay, Jim. Stand by 1.
Okay, Aquarius. When you get her pretty much in attitude there, and it looks like you're as close as we need to be, we'd like to try a control mode and see if it will work; sort of a semi-PTC. We'll leave the ball powered up for this, and if this doesn't work, why, we'll have to revert to ATTITUDE HOLD mode. But - Stand by 1, please.
We'd like you to think about this control mode, Jim, and see if you think it might work from what you know right now. We're a little skeptical, but we'd like to put it to you. So, once you get in a pretty good attitude, monitor in VERB 16 NOUN 20, go to PGNS MINIMUM IMPULSE, VERB 76, as we have, and set up a yaw rate - yaw rate to the right. Monitor the middle gimbal on R<sub>3</sub> on the DSKY and see if she'll kind of stabilize out. If not, the only other suggestion we've got is to go to PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD. We'll keep the ball up until you make this evaluation.
Okay, Houston. You cut out, say again.
Okay. Where'd you lose me, Jim?
I lost you when you said try the control mode; you're a little skeptical.
Okay. From what you say, we have to be a little skeptical of this procedure, but we'd like to have you try it and have you evaluate it. You can monitor the middle gimbal on R<sub>3</sub>. Before we power down the ball, we want your evaluation. The next best choice is PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD. Over.
Okay. I'll try it.
Okay. Go ahead with the control mode procedure.
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. I'm not ... you. I can monitor register 3. I can probably keep it out of ... - going into gimbal lock.
Roger. How are pitch and roll?
Okay. I think I can control the gimbal angles in 16 20 with the compressors the way they are, but I'll have to try MINIMUM IMPULSE - just a minute.
Okay, Jack. I've a question - one more question about Odyssey.
Go ahead.
Okay, I still have the PYRO A sequence A and PYRO B sequence B circuit breakers in. Do you want those out?
Stand by 1.
Odyssey, Houston. The two circuit breakers you referred to, leave them in.
Okay. Copy. Leave them in.
Okay, Houston. I can control yaw in minimum impulse, but stand by on pitch.
And, Fred-o, the DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> resultant computes with the components.
Fred's off the COMM now, Jack.
Roger. Your PAD is good.
And, Jack, we didn't get that whole sentence there.
Okay. I said that the DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> that Fred questioned computes well with the component - its rms.
Okay. Copy.
Okay, now. Jack, let's go over this once more. You wanted me to try out control of the spacecraft in the PULSE mode. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. Set up a yaw rate and monitor the middle gimbal angle.
Okay. I can do that. I'm not too sure whether I can control roll or pitch in pulse, but I can control yaw in pulse - yaw in pulse on the ball.
Roger. And remember we're not going to have a ball there, so that we're going to be monitoring CDUs on the DSKY, and if we get it off, it will be pretty hard to figure out where to fly back to; and, well, in addition, have to control the OMNIs while we're doing this.
Roger.
Without the ball, I still have use of the TTCA for control of the - angles.
Affirmative. You'll have the TTCA for pitch and roll.
Okay. I think I can do that without the ball, and if you just give me the TTCA|TTCAs I think I can control the spacecraft using 16 20.
I'm going to yaw right.
Okay, Jack. I am now - The REGISTER 1 is in the DECREASE mode.
And, Houston, do you see anything wrong with this spacecraft motion?
We have a data drop on right now, Jim; we'll look at it as soon as it comes up.
Okay, Aquarius. We're going to dispense with this control mode. We'd like you to fly the machine back to the original attitude that you had, and we'll go PGNS ATTITUDE HOLD, and then we've got to get that ball off the line to save some power. And then, in order to keep even heating, every 15 or 30 minutes, we'll give you a call to give us 90 or 180 degrees of roll - of yaw.
Okay. You want me to go back to original attitude. I'll be going back to it now.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I'm flying it back over towards the initial angles you gave me of a pitch of 257. I'll get near the bellyband in roll and yaw; then I'll go to PGNS ATT HOLD.
That's affirmative, Jim. And then we're going to have you go through a powerdown procedure.
Okay.
And you'll need VERB 77 with ATT HOLD when you get there.
Will do.
Okay, Jack. Have I gotten your 360 on yaw and roll? I'm going to go to ATT HOLD.
Roger. And then we want to get the ball part down.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. I'm now in PGNS ATT HOLD. And are you reading my DSKY angles?
Roger. We see them.
Now, you want me to power down the ball, and if you'll give me the procedure for that, I'll do it right away.
Okay. We'll buy what you've got on the DSKY there, and we'd just like to go through an overall powerdown procedure, and in so doing we'll catch the ball and inverter and it will only take a few minutes. So are you ready to start on panel 11?
Roger. Jack will copy, and I'll do the work.
Okay. Panel 11, top row, open all the circuit breakers.
All circuit breakers on top row coming open.
They're all open, top row.
Okay. Second row, close the first six on the left through the ISOL VALVE and open all to the right of that.
Okay. First six on the left are closed - That's through the ISOL VALVE, but I opened up every one from there on.
Okay. Third row, open up the next five - correction - Open up the first five on the left, close AOT HEATER, close SIG CONDITIONER 1. Close ATTITUDE DIRECT, and open the rest on row three.
Do you want ATCA (PGNS) open?
Leave ATCA (PGNS) closed; four breakers on the third row must be closed. AOT HEATER, SIG CONDITIONER 1, and ATCA (PGNS), ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL. Our mistake, good going.
Okay. I'm opening up ENGINE START OVERRIDE right now. And that row's taken care of.
Okay. On the fourth row. Open - From the left, open the first five - correction - Close the first five, and open CABIN FAN 1. Close the three GLYCOL PUMP circuit breakers; open all the COMM breakers, except for COMMANDER'S AUDIO; close it. All the PGNS breakers, open - correction - Open the first three PGNS breakers, close LGC/DSKY, IMU STANDBY, IMU OPERATE.
That's complete, Jack.
Okay. And EPS, close BAT FEED TIES, CROSSTIE BAL LOAD, and open the CROSS TIE BUS. Close the next three; open ASCENT ECA CONTROL, ASCENT ECA, and INVERTER 1. Close DC BUS VOLT. Go ahead.
That's complete, Jack. Panel 11 is configured.
Okay. Let's go over to panel 16, top row, and starting from the left - Open the first four.
Stand by, Jack.
Okay. Starting from the left, open the first four.
Okay. And close the ISOL VALVE, keep your TCA breakers closed, close the CROSSFEED, open the next two displays. Close the MAIN SOV and the PROPULSION breakers should all three be open.
Roger. The main valves are closed, and the DISPLAY ENGINE OVERRIDE LOGIC's coming open, and the PQGS and ASC He REG are open.
That's affirmative. The second row: they should all be open except for three breakers under instrumentation. Close SIG SENSOR, PCM/TE, and SIG CONDITIONER 2. Over.
Roger. Do you want SUIT FLOW CONTROL open?
ENGINE ARM coming open and ASA I guess will be open. Is that correct?
We just got a change on that. Let's keep the ASA closed.
How about SUIT FLOW CONTROL and ENGINE ARM?
Okay, Jim. SUIT FLOW CONTROL can be open, and ENGINE ARM - ENGINE ARM open.
Okay. Let's go to row 3.
Okay. Row 3 under COMM. Open DISPLAYS, close SE AUDIO, open VHF A TRANSMITTER and B RECEIVER, close the PRIMARY S-BAND circuit breakers, both of them. Open the S-BAND ANTENNA, PMP closed, TV open, and all the rest of them open under ECS, except CO<sub>2</sub> SENSOR, closed.
Roger.
Okay. Under row 4: under HEATERS, your RCS QUAD heaters should - four of them - be closed, open DISPLAYS, open S-BAND ANTENNA, open SEQUENCE CAMERA. Under EPS, open DISPLAYS, close DC BUS VOLT, open INVERTER 2, open ASCENT ECA CONTROL and ASCENT ECA, close DESCENT ECA, DESCENT ECA CONTROL, TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, close CROSS TIE BAL LOADS, open CROSS TIE BUS, close BAT FEED TIES. Over.
That's been completed, Jack.
Okay, Jim. And we've already got a change to what we just told you. Under ECS, close the CABIN REPRESS, and insure that the ASA BREAKER is closed under S and C.
The ASA BREAKER is closed, but I closed the CABIN REPRESS.
Okay, Jim. Looks like what we have to do is - In order to maintain even heating, we just have to yaw the whole machine about 90 degrees per hour in increments. So we'll give you a call when it's time to yaw 90 degrees.
Okay. We have to YAW the machine as I understand it, Houston, and you'll give it to me in increments of 90 degrees.
That's affirm.
Okay, Jim. Your present configuration has the following features. We got the electrical BUSES cross tied through the BAL LOAD circuit breakers, and we have AUTO CABIN REPRESS. One thing we'd like to do right now is to give you an uplink, so immediately we have to, on panel 11, close the UPDATA LINK circuit breaker. Go to P00 and DATA. Over.
Okay. We're going to P00 and DATA. The circuit breaker is closed.
Houston, Aquarius. Did you say that you had a new pad for us to copy?
Jim, I passed that newest pad that we have to Fred about 30 minutes ago. That's our latest. It's PC plus 2, and it begins with NOUN 33 of 79 hours 27 minutes and 40.13 seconds. You got that one?
Okay. We've got that one. What kind of a ATT HOLD MODE do you want us to do? Do you want us to do WIDE DEADBAND? I didn't ... on the DAP.
Jim, the deadband is good the way it is. It's 5 degrees, if you want to stay in it. And stay in the PGNS ATT HOLD mode.
Okay.
Two things, Jim. We want you to know that there's some pretty big attitude errors in, so if you go to AUTO, the computer is going to try to crank you around, and the other thing is don't drink water out of the LM.
Okay. You might think about this. You know we lost our oxygen pressure in the command module.
Aquarius, we're finished with the uplink. The computer is yours, and you can open the UPDATA LINK circuit breaker.
Okay. We've opened up the UPDATA LINK, and we've gone OFF of DATA, and I've got 16 20 in the computer.
Roger, Jim. I guess we're going to just kind of perk away here now.
Okay, Jack. One more question about Odyssey here.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. How about the service module O<sub>2</sub> supply valve? Do you want that off?
Affirmative. Service module O<sub>2</sub> supply off, Jack.
Okay. On the way.
And, Jim, we see a PROGRAM ALARM in there. We think it's just got to do with pulling the UPDATA LINK circuit breaker - UPLINK too fast.
Roger. I don't see it. Should I reset?
Go ahead and reset, Jim.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
One thought that might occur here is that if we have low descent water pressure, we might consider taking the PLSS water and fill it in reverse. If that works, you might look at a procedure for that.
That's a good thought. Let us bounce that around a little.
Okay, Jim. That's a good thought, and we've looked at that, and it looks like that's feasible. So if and when we need to do that, we will.
And, something else, Jack. When it's time for me to make my 90-degree yaw, what I planned on doing was going to NOUN 76 hold and just pulse and yaw several times until the yaw start and hope that pitch and roll stay within the limit.
Roger. It sounds like a good plan and you can use your TTCA in MIN IMPULSE to take care of pitch and roll.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. We see ASCENT O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2 building up again, so we'd like to use something out of it, so turn on ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2 and turn off descent O<sub>2</sub>.
Roger. Opening up ascent O<sub>2</sub> tank number 2, and turning off descent.
And, Aquarius, Houston. We're starting to think about CO<sub>2</sub> buildup up in the command module there so we've got a recommendation, and what we're recommending is that you take the commander's hoses in the LM and put a cap over the red return hose and then figure out a way to fasten those hoses so they blow up into the CSM by extending them up through the tunnel as far as possible. And we'll get some flow out the blue side, circulate up and around the command module and to keep the CO<sub>2</sub> level down.
Roger. We're thinking of that too, and one problem is that the COMM is connected securely to the hose, so we've got to get the COMM cable off somehow to get that - So we'll still have COMM down here in the LM and you have the hose up there.
Houston, we're trying to extend that commander's hose by use of the vacuum hose.
Sounds like a good plan if you can work that out, Jim.
Aquarius, if you can shake Jack loose there, I've got a - some procedures for him to write down.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay, Jack. Is this a long one?
Oh, it's about 12 - 15 lines. It's a matter of verifying some valves and so forth.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. We want you to go in when you can and verify the following valves and leave them as we outline here. REPRESS PACKAGE valve, off; EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE, off; DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>, off; DEMAND REG, off; both WATER ACCUMULATORS, off; MAIN REG A and B, open; WATER GLYCOL - correction - WATER and then GLYCOL TANK INLET and OUTLET, both. Now if you want to get some water, we recommend that you momentarily turn the SURGE TANK on to pressurize the system and then turn it off and take out water as required. Over.
That's it, Jack. And another note on taking water; if you don't drain enough water so that - -
Say again, Aquarius.
That wasn't us, Jack.
Okay. One more note on the water, Jack. If you don't bleed the pressure off when you - don't take enough water to bleed the pressure off completely, the pressure that's left on there is going to drain away in a period of 1 to 3 hours. So it's a small amount of oxygen, but we might as well save it. So if you want to eliminate that problem you could completely drain the pressure off by putting the water in a water bag and saving it that way.
Okay. That's a good idea.
So that's the end of my - -
What I'll do - let me repeat - Okay. Let me repeat it all back to you. REPRESS PACKAGE VALVE, off; EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE, off; DIRECT O<sub>2</sub>, off; both the DEMAND REGs, off; both H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATORS, WATER GLYCOL ACCUMULATORS, off; MAIN REG A and B, open; WATER and GLYCOL TANK INLET and OUTLET, open; for water, momentarily pressurize the SURGE TANK, take out water as required. You're recommending drain out all the water until I can't get any more water out of it in order to conserve the oxygen.
Okay. We just want you to turn off the water accumulators and not the glycol accumulator. Over.
Okay. These are the water accumulators on 382, right?
That's affirm. The accumulators on 382.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
Roger, Jack. We're asking whether P51 and a P52 are required in the back side of the Moon.
I think so, Jim, but stand by while I verify it.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
We think we know where the platform is, Jim. The tracking looks real good from the last burn. We feel just a P52 will be required.
Okay.
Joe, has your continued tracking changed our pericynthion altitude any?
Stand by. We'll get the latest on that, Jack.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Jack. We're still looking at 137 miles and Doppler's confirming it. We will have a good update after 67 hours.
That's good. I want to say you guys are doing real good work.
So are you guys, Jack.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. We've come up with a COMM recommendation which we hope will save some power by powering down the power amplifier, if it works. And I'd like to read up the steps to you and have you think about them for a minute, and we recommend trying it before the first yaw maneuver. Over.
Okay. You can read up the steps.
Okay. Step 1, BIOMED off; step 2, go to LOW BIT RATE; step 3, go to DOWNVOICE BACKUP; step 4, POWER AMP to PRIME; step 5, panel 16, POWER AMP CIRCUIT BREAKER open; step 6, RANGE FUNCTION switch, off. Read those back to me, and then I'll have a remark.
Okay. BIOMED, off; LOW BIT RATE; DOWNVOICE BACKUP; POWER AMP to PRIME; circuit breakers, panel 16, POWER AMP CIRCUIT BREAKER, open. RANGE FUNCTION switch, off.
Okay. And the note says that you should be able to hear us. If we can't hear you in a couple of minutes, you should close the POWER AMP circuit breaker on panel 16, and we expect to save an amp or more on this. It should work in the present attitude. When we go to the new yaw attitude, we're thinking about powering up the steerable, leaving the POWER AMP off and, if we can get good COMM in that mode, we'll still save some power. So if you concur, why don't you go ahead.
Okay. In this mode, you should hear us - or we should hear you, but if you can't hear us, then we ought to close POWER AMP circuit breaker again. Is that right.
That's affirm. We'll just run a little COMM check after you get done and see how we're doing.
Okay, fine. And if that all fails, we'll go back to our original configuration.
That's affirm.
All amps PRIMARY.
POWER AMPs in PRIMARY.
Okay. Circuit breakers 16, POWER AMP circuit breaker, open; COMM; POWER AMP circuit breaker, open.
There's only one. Ready?
RANGE ... switch off.
It is off. ...
Yes, I think so; yes, that's off.
... Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read me?
Aquarius, this is Houston. We read you with a lot ... static. How do you read us? Over.
We read you with a lot of noise, the noise seems to indicate ... read you better.
I didn't copy your last remark, Jim. I heard that you had a lot of noise in the background also.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read us now?
Just the same, Jim. You're readable but it's very noisy.
Okay. We can still read you. Do you want us to remain in this configuration?
Stay there for the next minute or two anyway, Jim, while we evaluate it.
Okay. I'll tell you what we need, Jack. Try to get this squared away again. We - See if you can't report the right procedures here. ... the procedures, the whole works, before we get all balled up here.
Yes. Okay. You guessed it.
I've come up with nothing here.
... we can use.
Stand by for ... Give me - ... over on my side there. My - ...
Find anything back in there?
No, wait a minute.
Better get a ... there, a paper towel. ...
Let's just check in here ...
Yes.
... Well, we should have some around here somewhere.
Yes. They are ...
Oh, here they are. ...
Why don't you put that right up there, just like that. Is that all you've got on it? There you go.
...
It sure stays on, I'll tell you that. It's built like a regular ...
Hey, look out that left-hand window. ... I can't see a thing.
...
Well, is there anything ... done earlier?
Okay. What we do here is, ...?
...
... the command module.
Find the flight plan, too, while up there.
Okay. Why don't you recopy this procedure on page 4-42.
We going to keep a log of all the procedures?
We ought to copy down the ones that get water, too. ... Keep them all in one spot.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Speak slow because there's a lot of noise in the background. Have you completed your first 90-degree yaw maneuver? And, if you haven't, we recommend it. Over.
Okay. We have not. We have not completed it. We will start. We want you to monitor the maneuver. Over.
Okay, Jim. And I want to pass you up a short procedure for activating the S-band steerable antenna, which we'd like you to do after you complete the 90-degree yaw. Are you ready to copy? Over.
Ready to copy.
Okay. First, on panel 11, close the S-BAND ANTENNA circuit breaker. Then go to Activation, page 28, steerable antenna activation - -
Roger. Copy.
- - and complete steps 2, 3, and 4 of Activation 28. You'll have to do a VERB 64 to get the pitch and yaw angles, and the last step is on panel 16, S-BAND ANTENNA HEATER circuit breaker to CLOSE. Over.
Joe, we didn't get all of that. We just have, "Complete steps 2, 3, and 4 of activation" and then 68 or 28.
Jim, that's - -
Then do a VERB 64 to get -
Aquarius, Houston. That procedure I just passed you, please disregard it. Over.
Disregard it. Okay. Do you want me to start my yaw maneuver now? And I'll be yawing to my right. One-way maneuver.
Roger. Right yaw is acceptable, but wait 1 before you start the maneuver.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. You are GO to commence the yaw maneuver. If we don't have COMM after you complete the yaw maneuver, bring the power amplifier back on. Over.
Roger. Understand. We'll start the yaw.
Okay.
...
... 277.
They're almost getting bigger and bigger, Jack. It's over here now.
Hey, you got a list ... off over here.
All that stuff ...
... to do is put water in it.
What do I turn that to?
...
... Yes ... down to 270 ...
It's jumping now.
Why don't you go RATE/RATE now, before we ...
We're on the ascent tank, too.
Houston, Aquarius. Did you call?
Negative, Houston. We did not call. How you reading us?
Get up front and turn that antenna ...
And, Houston, could you give us an approximate time to turn off the ascent O<sub>2</sub> in case we're losing point with you?
Roger, Jim; and copying about half your words.
Roger, Houston. We'd like a time to go back to descent O<sub>2</sub> in case we lose communications with you.
Jim, Houston. That's affirmative. You may go back to descent O<sub>2</sub>. Over.
Roger. Going back now.
Copy that.
We're ... up-side down.
Yes.
Think we'll have any trouble getting that ... with that ... in there?
Probably not, if everything holds together because we already made one burn.
And the temperatures look good. When you make a burn, does that do something ...?
...
Well, Jack. This is going to be difficult.
... ...
I'll tell you, we'll have to start thinking about ...
How about ...?
How about ...?
Yes, we got ...
... once every hour?
How about that ... tank ...?
How much of that oxygen are you going to use for -
We got - water glycol ... off. ... need any more water? ... again?
... out there?
Yes, why don't we ...?
... out? Can you get that?
... down there. ...
Houston, Aquarius. Are you ...?
Aquarius, Houston. Say again, please. ...
Roger. We have a radio check at a new attitude.
Okay, Jim. We copy the angles. How are you receiving the voice now? Over.
Your voice is excellent.
Okay. Real good. You are clear. We still have a lot of noise, but if you talk slow I think we can manage.
Aquarius, Houston.
This is Aquarius. Go ahead.
Roger, Jim. We're trying to improve our COMM down here. We'd like to try going function switch from DOWN VOICE BACKUP to VOICE. Over.
... DOWN VOICE BACKUP ... switch going from DOWN VOICE BACKUP to VOICE.
Roger that.
How do you read now, Jim?
Aquarius, Houston. Request a short count. Over.
Aquarius, Houston. We're not reading you at all. Request you go back to DOWN VOICE BACKUP. Over.
All right. Houston, Aquarius in DOWN VOICE BACKUP. How do you read? Over.
Okay, Jim, we read you now and you'd better stay in this configuration.
Well, ... try ...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim, since we're in LOW BIT RATE now, we cannot monitor the DSKY for program alarms, et cetera, and we recommend that, in order for you to do so on board, you push in the following circuit breakers: On panel 11 and panel 16 the ANUNCIATOR/DOCK/COMPONENT circuit breakers. That will allow you to monitor your DSKY warning lights. Over.
Okay ...
..., OFF.
Roger, Houston. Would you say one more time ... please?
Okay, Jim. The circuit breakers are the ANUNCIATOR/DOCK/COMPONENT circuit breakers on panel 11, third row, far right, under LIGHTING; and on panel 16, also under LIGHTING, second row, third from the left. Over.
Roger, Houston. We have those two circuit breakers - engaged.
Okay, real good.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Joe, it appears that the best detent possibly to put the stars in the AOT, would be either number 2 or 4. The rendezvous radar antenna is now in the way. You might think of a procedure to get rid of it with minimum power and then we maybe we'll be able to see stars in a couple of minutes here in a lower detent.
Okay, Jim. I think I understood that the rendezvous radar antenna is in the way and you would like a procedure to get it out of the way. Is that right?
That's affirm; at the proper time, and with minimum power.
Roger. Understand. We'll work that.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. Jim, we have a handover coming up on the hour; that's in a minute and a half. On the hour, we would like you to turn the S-BAND TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER switch to OFF, and 5 minutes later turn it back to PRIMARY. Over.
Okay, Houston. Shortly you want us to turn the S-BAND TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER to OFF; 5 minutes later, turn it back to PRIMARY.
That's affirmative, Jim. After the handover apparently they want to make sure that they lockup with you and not the IU.
Roger. And let me know when you want me to turn it off.
Roger. You can turn it off now.
And, Houston, when do you want me to turn that S-BAND TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER off?
Aquarius, Houston. Turn it off now.
Turning it off now.
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. We have data back and I assume we have COMM. Over.
Houston, This is Aquarius. The COMM is very, very, very noisy. Over.
Aquarius, Houston. Copy that. It's noisy on our end, too; stand by while we think about it.
Houston, Aquarius. I am unable to ... now ...
Jim, Houston. I think you just called, but I didn't copy you.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, recommend you push the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker on panel 16 in. Over.
Roger. POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker panel 16 going in.
POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker is in.
Okay, Jim. How is the COMM now? Over.
A lot of background noise. Let me turn off the SQUELCH.
Okay. You're quite a bit better.
Whenever I enable SQUELCH, I lose you. Over.
Roger. Stand by. You are much better down link.
Look at NOUN 65.
Okay.
Okay, Jim. This is Houston. We recommend that you set the FUNCTION switch from DOWNVOICE BACKUP to VOICE. Over.
Roger. FUNCTION switch going from DOWNVOICE BACKUP to VOICE.
Okay, Jim. How's the COMM now?
FUNCTION switch ... There's still a lot of background noise, Joe.
Okay. We'll look at it some more. Your COMM down to us is excellent now.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
The noise we're experiencing is similar to what we had sometime before when you switched stations.
Roger, Jim. INCO is checking into what we can do about the noise. It may be a problem with the new site.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. Is the noise any better now? Over.
This is Aquarius. Negative.
Roger.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Will you let us know when you want us to yaw another 90 degrees right?
Will do, Jim. Stand by 1.
Okay, Jim. We're ready now to yaw another 90 degrees to the right.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
We are going to try to improve the COMM and telemetry by temporarily breaking lock and reacquiring. You may hear some noise in your headset.
Okay. Couldn't be any more noise than we're getting now.
Right.
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. Now that there's no noise, you can give ...
Jim, I didn't copy that. Your COMM is pretty good, though. How is it with us?
Good. Okay.
Houston, do you want to reconfigure the DOWN VOICE BACKUP again?
Aquarius, Houston. I don't think so at this time. Our voice is good now. How's yours?
Ours is very good.
Okay, why don't we stay where we are for a few minutes.
Okay. Houston, Aquarius. We're deadbanding in the new attitude.
Aquarius, Houston. Roger that, and your COMM is good.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. In order to save on an amp or 2 of power here, we'd like you to go to the DOWN VOICE BACKUP COMM configuration, which is pulling the power and circuit breaker and going to DOWN VOICE BACKUP. If we get into a COMM problem, all you have to do is reverse that configuration, and it should be good again. Over.
Okay, we'll go to DOWN VOICE BACKUP and pull the POWER AMPL circuit breaker, and if we get into trouble, we'll come back again.
Okay, real fine, and we estimate the next yaw maneuver should start at about 68:02. Over.
Okay. Could you give me that in minutes?
I sure can. That's going to be in 29 minutes from now, Jim.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We're in DOWN VOICE BACKUP and the POWER AMPLIFIER is pulled.
Jim, Houston. Roger that. You are readable through the noise. How are we? Over.
You are loud and clear.
Very good.
Yes, I guess ... at this time ... out ... configuration ..., and we have to get ... ...
Okay. What else do we have to ...
...
Okay.
...
...
...
I guess they're going to take ...
...
Well, there's another good one ...
... going off?
...
No. ... we had battery power for a while, we could ...
It's locked.
...
I don't think that was ...
... powered up ...
... got one.
... ... all powered down.
...
... have to get ...
... get our ... are off.
Yes.
... all three ...
...
Seems like ... the burn ...
... ...
...
...
... We're going to have to do something to get all this water out of here.
I'll set up ... before I turn the thing on.
Okay, we'll get this thing -
...
...
...?
Yes.
... ...
There you go.
...?
... this one.
Okay.
...?
That's right.
Thank you.
...?
I'll wake you up.
...
All right.
(Coughing)
About four ...
Okay.
Go ahead.
...
...
... ...?
Yes.
... Over on the ...
Well, I'm afraid this is going to be the last lunar mission for a long time.
... copy.
Are we in DOWN VOICE BACKUP ...
Yes.
Maybe it should reverse itself. I think ...
...
Yes.
... radio check.
Aquarius, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Maneuver complete.
Roger, Jim. We show you on telemetry. Looks solid at the new attitude. Just by the way of information, the latest tracking data shows the pericynthion to be holding somewhere above 136 miles, and the pad you have is still good. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Okay, and, Jim, we wonder whether you've attempted to get drinking water out of the command module po-ti [sic] tank yet. It's - Is that going all right or do you have any questions on it. Over.
... do it at 169 hours.
We're all ... do it at 169 hours - or 69 hours.
I need a command module activation ...
Houston, Aquarius. Over.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
As we approach the burn, you want to go through the same check that we did for the last burn. That is, we want to make sure we have everything powered up ... circuit breaker by circuit breaker in conjunction with your direction. And for ... we ought to have a procedure for powering up the command module again when we have to go back into the command module ...
Okay, Jim. We copied that. First of all, you want to go through the circuit by circuit breaker careful powered-up procedure for the next DPS burn, and we're working on that. Secondly, you want a procedure for powering the command module up again when you have to re-enter it and power it up and we're talking about that and working one up, and we'll get both those for you ...
Roger.
Joe, can you also get us an idea about how far out we can expect to make it on the command module batteries.
Okay, Jack. It sounds as though we probably don't want to power up the command module before EI minus 2 hours. That doesn't mean we can't start our procedure a good deal before that, but we don't want to power it up much before EI minus 2. Over.
Okay. I was just thinking in case something - we had the sort of problem here about how we would go about getting in the command module ... we need to power up - and - in order to make it back into Earth.
Right, Jack. It's quite clear that we're going to have to very carefully make up a full checklist for you on that; we'll do it.
What they're going to do is ... power Aquarius up ...
Oh, well, we've got to have something to ... Besides, we can get rid of the LM ... decide then what they'll do.
My guess is what they'll do - Well, I guess, aline the GDC ... and get EMS ...
And - we haven't even figured out yet the ... batteries, have we?
Oh, I'm sure we have.
... - hundred ampere-hours. We had it figured out that we had 550 ampere-hours left. ...
...
... bigger than 133 hours. ... Oh, yes, I guess - Yes, he's ... the descent Thursday afternoon. He had it figured out that - for a splashdown at ... number of hours - 74 hours, and we've figured out that we - I don't know how we arrived at this - but he added up all the ...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. We just thought of something; namely, that we probably should get the lithium hydroxide canisters out of the command module reasonably soon just to make certain that they don't stay in there and possibly swell up until they'd be hard to get out. I wouldn't wake up Fred for that, but it's something you should do possibly before you go to sleep.
Roger. Will do.
Okay.
..., Fred-o. We're 68 hours, about, and 46 minutes. Did you sleep good?
... lithium hydroxide ...
Yes, I think I'll do that right now. Fred-o, get on the ...
Okay, Jack, take the lithium hydroxide canisters out. Tie them down, or something like that ... command module. And then get us some food ...
How much time did you say these batteries had?
... 800 ampere ...
Aa-ah. Think I'll get an aspirin - a couple of aspirin again ...
I'd like a couple of aspirin, too.
Well, would you like some pictures?
Be sure you get all the water out you can. ...
You're holding your attitude right now. What time have you got to ...?
Probably another 5 minutes.
How much water in the ...
What time was it when we powered up the LM, do you recall? 58 hours?
How did the water come out?
Okay, ... That's another big ..., man. If we have to start drinking water out of the ... drink damn near a gallon a day.
I'm also figuring that when we've got to go back in there, we'll ... take the drogue and the food ... back here - take these - put these back in there. ...
Hello, Houston. How do you read?
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston; did you -
Okay, you hear me, Joe?
Oh, not very good, Jack; suggest that for communication here, we go to POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker IN and FUNCTION switch to VOICE.
Okay, I didn't want to get through or anything. I just wanted to check and see if we had you at all in this mode.
Oh, yes, we do have COMM. You're extremely noisy but if you read loud and slow we can easily copy it.
Okay. Joe, I read you loud and clear on this mode.
Roger, we understand that. It is strictly a downlink problem and you can stay in the DOWN VOICE BACKUP mode if you want. If we get involved in conversation, I think we'll want to go back to NORMAL voice.
How you doing, Jack?
Do you have an hour on your clock for ...
Joe, this is Aquarius; wonder if you can give me the GET time of initial powerup?
Fred, Houston. Understand you'd like to know the GET of your initial powerup, is that correct?
Yes, the second time in here.
Okay, stand by.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, we don't have a percise time for the starting of that procedure yet; we are working on it real hard. It won't be for several hours; and we'll pass it up to you just as soon as we get it. Over.
Okay, and, Joe, you want us to start a PTC maneuver at this time?
Stand by and I'll check.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Jim. We would like the next yaw maneuver in about 6 minutes. Over.
Roger.
Okay.
Oh, yes, yes. Keep opening - open the jets slowly ... Keep working at it.
Is there some way that we could ... water in the PLSS.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. Our estimate is that we will start powering up for the DPS burn at about 76 hours elapsed, which is about 6-3/4 hours from now.
Roger, Joe. Understand.
Okay, Joe, about 76 hours or so and I guess you misunderstood. My question was what was the GET way back when, when I first came across to the LM and transferred to LM power? How long have we been living on the LM, now?
Oh; Roger. Stand by. I'll give you that. Yes, I just didn't understand.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, the time of transfer to LM power was 57 hours, 11 minutes. For your information, we seem to be reasonably fat on power. In fact, we are looking at a procedure that we might recommend to you later on after the burn and so forth of powering up one of the command module main buses via the LM umbilical. This would enable us possibly to charge up the command module batteries. Over.
Okay, Joe. That sounds great. I just thought that to pass the time, I'd do a little backseat quarterbacking, here.
Roger.
How's the water doing?
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We request AFT OMNI at this time. Over.
AFT OMNI.
That's affirm.
Yes. ... is going to be 123.
You mean you're ... 12247?
...
Yes.
I'm trying to ... this heater over here.
Yes. I'll ... that.
Jim, that spacecraft's looking pretty close; a about 86 or ...
Well, ...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Fred. I have a few words for you on some things we want to do in the next few hours, and in order to get good COMM for that and also in order to give FIDO a few minutes of ranging, I want to have you put the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker in panel 16 in, the VOICE FUNCTION switch to VOICE, and RANGING FUNCTION switch to RANGING. Over.
Now I'm in NORMAL voice and RANGING is up.
Okay, Fred. And you're loud and clear down here now. Okay. What we're getting a procedure ready for you is to do an AOT Sun check at approximately 74 hours or in just a little over 3 hours. That will be a detent 2; we'll have a detail procedure up shortly and it will include a rendezvous radar redesignation to get it out of the way and a P52 maneuver to the attitude. It's our feeling that if that checks out within 1 degree that your platform will be okay for the burn without a subsequent P52. If it's not within 1 degree, we are working up an Earth/Sun alinement procedure to aline the platform, and we'll have that up to you later. Okay. Assuming that the Sun check is okay, we will then give you a star for a confidence check on the back side when you're in the darkness. We'll be updating a burn pad to you prior to LOS going around the Moon. We'll have another look at you after AOS, and we'll update the pad if required. Right now that update should be very small. Over.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay. Joe. As I read that, at 74 hours we're going to do an AOT Sun check at detent 2, which is going to require the rendezvous radar out of the way. And we use P52 AUTO maneuver to get there, or at least the angles out of that, and if this passes within 1 degree, you're saying the platform is okay for the maneuver, and we won't need a subsequent P52. But even if it is okay, you'll give us a star which we can use for our check when we're in darkness. If this check flunks, you'll pass us on up then an Earth/Moon aline procedure.
Okay, Fred. That's correct, except the aline procedure that we're working on is an Earth/Sun aline, and other than that, that's correct. Incidentally, this TC plus 2 maneuver looks like it will still be around a 900-foot-per-second maneuver and that it will get you back to the mid-Pacific line at 142 hours.
Okay. That was an Earth/Sun check, John. We're getting a little close to the Moon now. And the TC plus 2 maneuver still looks about 900 foot per second to get us at mid-PAC, at about 142 hours.
That's right.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay, Fred. We got a good batch of ranging and now we'd like you to reverse the configuration, RANGING to OFF, VOICE FUNCTION to DOWN VOICE BACKUP, POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker out; we'll be talking to you.
DOWN VOICE BACKUP with the POWER AMP breaker open now. How do you read?
We read you satisfactorily, Fred.
Okay.
Jim and Jack are in the upstairs bedroom taking a nap now.
I didn't know that was upstairs.
We have the first space station.
(Laughter)
And, Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
One other thing you might have somebody look at - I don't want to bother the guys upstairs - the drain hose that we've got in the command module, I wonder if we can find out if it will plug into the PLSS and in which case we can keep transferring - later on at least - the command module water into the LM via the PLSS.
Okay, Fred. You're almost up with us. We are looking real hard at getting water from the command module waste tank into the PLSS, using that hose and then dumping it from the PLSS into the LM ascent tank, and we think it is feasible; we're checking it out to make sure.
Okay.
Okay. I have time to do another maneuver here, Joe.
Okay, Fred. Let me verify that.
Fred, Houston. That is verified. You can go ahead with the yaw maneuver.
Roger.
Okay. Just made another maneuver. We allowed for a little too much roll, there. I wonder if that's too much, or should I try to take it out now that I got it stopped.
Fred, this is Houston. - -
Twenty degrees roll left - Yes. All right; go ahead.
Okay, Fred. I didn't copy the beginning of your message.
Okay, I - I was talking to Jim, there.
Sorry.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger. Listen, Charlie Duke wants to talk to you - to you about the AOT star check; and, so that we can have good COMM, I'd like to reconfigure with the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker in and the VOICE FUNCTION switch to VOICE and while we're at it, we'd like the RANGING FUNCTION switch to RANGING. Over.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Houston, Aquarius.
Roger, Fred-o. Reading you - -
Okay, Houston, Aquarius. Go ahead.
Okay, Fred-o. Reading you 5-by. The procedure I'm going to read up to you is a Sun check for the - to see if we're going to need an alinement or not. If you'll get out your G&N dictionary and open it to P52, page 34, we'll start at the bottom. Over.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Sounds like you broke out, Charlie.
Yes, finally, Fred-o. I've no longer got the red spots.
Okay. Stand by, Aquarius. We'll be back with you momentarily.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. You ready with your G&N dictionary? Over.
Okay. I'm on page 34 now, looking at P52.
Okay, Fred-o. At the bottom of the page, we want step 1, on the flashing 0406, we want an option 3, and that'll pull us over to 6; and, on the 5025, we want you to do the ENTER on the 5025, and that'll bring up flashing 0170, and load in R<sub>1</sub> 200. Over.
Okay. Let me see if I'm with you. We call up P52 and, on the flashing 0406, we PRO on a 3 REFSMMAT which leads us to a flashing 5025. We ENTER on that. On the flashing 0170, we want to ENTER a 200.
That's affirmative; and after that, you PRO on that, and you come up with a flashing 0688, and we'll have to load NOUN 88. And if you're ready to copy, I have the Sun half-unit vectors at 74 hours GET. Over.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. At Sun half-unit vectors, X, R<sub>1</sub>, is plus 0.45498, Y plus 19024, Z plus 08250. Over.
Okay. We PRO on - after entering the 200. We'll get a flashing 0688. We then load the Sun unit vectors for 74 hours, which are R<sub>1</sub> plus 5 - correction, plus 45498, R<sub>2</sub> plus 19024, R<sub>3</sub> plus 08250.
Roger. That's good, Fred-o. And that'll bring you to step 8, and you get a flashing 5018 when you PRO on the NOUN 88. Okay. At 5018, we want to do an AUTO maneuver to - to the attitude, so just do the - the PRO with the GUIDANCE CONTROL, PNGS; MODE CONTROL, PNGS, AUTO; and we'll take this attitude. Now, that's going to put us at - at attitude for the Sun check. Now, we're being a 1.4-degree deadband in this program in a docked configuration; so, to help you out, you could call VERB 62 to get your needles - and it - when the needles go through zero or null out and - in that deadband - then you take a look in the AOT and see how close the Sun is. And we want within plus or minus 1 degree. Over.
Okay. So we PRO on the NOUN 88, and we end up with a flashing 5018; and you want an AUTO maneuver here rather than using the TTCA, so we PRO with GUIDANCE, PNGS; MODE CONTROL, AUTO. We've got a 1.4-degree deadband with a VERB 62 will give us the needles to try to zero them in and, at that time I look through the AOT and, if it's like Apollo 11 Sun check, all we've got to have is the Sun somewhere in the - out there somewhere on the Sun as it passes. Is that correct?
I think that's a little tight; that's about a quarter degree. We can go a little bit out of that. Stand by 1. Fred, we'll get you an answer on that one. And also, if you'll stand by, we'll give you a DAP load for this maneuver. Over.
Okay. We'll - You'll give us a DAP load.
Roger. Stand by.
Aquarius, Houston. Fred-o, on that - to pass that check, the Sun is at - will subtend an arc of one-half degree in the AOT, so you can be two diameters off and still pass the check. Over.
Okay. It's a half a degree, and so we can be two Sun diameters off and still pass.
That's affirmative. And we want you to maneuver with a DAP of 0.2 of a degree a second. Over.
Okay. You want us to use a DAP of 0.2.
Okay. That DAP load, Fred-o, is 31120. Over.
Okay. 31120.
Roger. Now, if we pass that check, you can just terminate P52 right there, and we'll give you an attitude to go to a burn attitude, and from this we can get a star check. If you don't pass, we'd like you to do an alinement at 75 hours. And, if you're ready to copy, we have some Sun half-unit vectors and some Earth half-unit vectors at 75 hours. Over.
Stand by 1, Charlie.
Okay. Go ahead for 75 hours - Sun and Earth half-unit vectors.
Roger. First with the Sun; for X, plus 45483; for Y, plus 19053; for Zebra, plus 08262; Earth half-unit vector at 75 hours, plus 32120, minus 34155, minus 17370. Over.
Okay. Sun half-unit vectors: R<sub>1</sub> plus 45483, R<sub>2</sub> plus 19053, R<sub>3</sub> plus 08262; Earth half-unit vectors: R<sub>1</sub> plus 32120, R<sub>2</sub> minus 34155, R<sub>3</sub> minus 17370.
Roger, Fred-o. Good readback. Now, on the Earth, we estimate it - if you have to do this alinement, that the Earth will be about a 2-degree Earth. And it'll be approximately three-quarters lighted. Now, to mark on the Earth, we'd like you to take an imaginary line between the horns of the crescent and mark midway between the horns. Over.
Okay. We got a 2-degree Earth that's three-quarter lighted, and we're to imagine a line between the horns of the Earth and mark right in the center of that line.
That's affirmative. Now, on - on this star check - correction, the Sun check, Fred, at - On the 5018, I got some FDAI angles for you if you're ready to copy. Over.
Okay. You're talking about the check at 74 hours GET, right?
Roger. Okay. At 74 hours when you start this maneuver, the 5018 should look like R<sub>1</sub> of 2703 degrees, pitch R<sub>2</sub> is 0903, and R<sub>3</sub> of 2908. Over.
Okay. How about making those all five digit readouts; read them again, Charlie.
Okay. Pardon me. It's 27030, 09030, 29080.
Okay. The 5018 should look like R<sub>1</sub> plus 27030, R<sub>2</sub> plus 09030, R<sub>3</sub> plus 29080.
Roger. That's good readback. Now, we got one more procedure for you; and, right now, we got the rendezvous radar stowed and we won't be able to see anything out of detent 2, so we'd like you to position the radar to 0283; and we have a procedure for that. And we'd like you to do that right before you get the attitude. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead.
Stand by.
Aquarius, Houston. On those 5018 angles we had at 74 hours, Fred, that was based on a VERB 49 to this attitude, and they will be incorrect for the two axis maneuvers, so you can just scratch them. Over.
Okay. You're saying the angles you gave me for the 5018, that was for a VERB 49, so they won't be good for the 5018, and we should scratch them.
That's affirmative. Okay. If you're ready to copy, I've got this rendezvous radar procedure. Over.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. It's about a 10-stepper, but real easy. Okay. On CB 16, EPS INVERTER 2, close. CB 11, AC BUS A BUS TIE INVERTER 2, close. Panel 14, verify INVERTER switch 2. CB 11 RENDEZVOUS RADAR 2, close. RENDEZVOUS RADAR, release. RENDEZVOUS RADAR to LGC on panel 3. Are you with me? Over.
Roger. I'm right up with you at step 6. Go ahead.
Okay, Fred. Good show. Step 6: VERB 41 NOUN 72 ENTER, plus all balls, plus 28300. Step 7: Monitor movement with VERB 16 NOUN 72. Step 8: CB 11 RENDEZVOUS RADAR 2, open. Are you with me? Over.
Stand by 1.
Okay. Go ahead now.
Roger. Step 9 is a VERB 44. Step 10: CB 16, EPS INVERTER 2, open. Over.
Okay. I got it.
Okay.
Do you want me to read it back now?
I got one more for you. You'll copy this and give me it all on the readback. Okay. Once you get the attitude and you want to use the - you want to get the AOT lamp, we got to go CB 16 EPS INVERTER 2, close; CB 11, AC BUS A AOT LAMP, close. After the P52, you can open CB 16 EPS INVERTER 2, and open CB 11 AC BUS A AOT LAMP and AC BUS A BUS TIE INVERTER 2. Over.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay. Let's see if I got it all. For rendezvous radar parking: first of all we want CB 16 EPS INVERTER 2, closed, CB 11 AC BUS A BUS TIE INVERTER 2, closed. Then on panel 14, verify INVERTER 2 selected. And CB 11 RENDEZVOUS RADAR 2 closed, both breakers. Then we are to pull the RENDEZVOUS RADAR RELEASE handle. On panel 3, we then want RENDEZVOUS RADAR to LGC. A VERB 41 NOUN 72 ENTER with plus all zips, plus 28300 in registers 1 and 2. GO on that. Then we monitor movement with the 16 72. After it gets parked, CB 11 RENDEZVOUS RADAR 2 open, followed by VERB 44 ENTER. And CB 16 EPS INVERTER 2 open. Now, when it comes time for the alinement to get an AOT lamp, CB 16, EPS INVERTER 2 closed, CB 11 AC BUS A AOT LAMP closed, and after the alinement is completed at CB 16, EPS INVERTER 2 open, CB 11 AC BUS A AOT LAMP open, CB 11 AC BUS A BUS TIE INVERTER 2 open.
Good readback, Aquarius. We'll - To get those needles on the VERB 62, we got to power up the commander's FDAI. We'll have that procedure for you shortly. Over.
Okay.
Charlie, Jim here.
Roger. Go ahead.
Have you run a Earth set alinement in the simulator with a docked configuration?
Is the question, "Have we run a - an alinement in the docked configuration?" That is affirmative.
Okay. Did you have any trouble controlling the vehicle, and what techniques did you use?
Briefly, to control pitch and roll, use the TTCA, as we've practiced; for yaw you can use the ACA. Over.
Okay. You have no special techniques going back and forth between the yaw and the X and Y lines. Over.
Not right now, Jim. Dave Scott's been running these things and we'll get them up to you shortly. Over.
Okay.
We think the alinement's going to be okay, so we don't have to do this P52 fullup alinement. We think the check is going to be okay. Like to remind you since you are in ATT - if check does not pass, since you are in attitude for the Sun, that we'd - We want the Sun half-unit vectors first. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Okay, Houston. It's been over an hour since we did our last PTC. You want us to do another one now?
Stand by 1. Over.
Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to go ahead and yaw 90 for the PTC. Keep a close eye out on your middle gimbal angle. You're about 30 degrees from gimhal lock, and we'll call you an OMNI switch halfway through the maneuver. Over.
Roger.
Okay. And, Houston, Aquarius. You might know when you've had enough ranging so we can get the power amp back off again.
Roger, Fred-o. We got one more procedure, and we can shut it down, and that's to get the needles and the FDAI for this maneuver. That 5018 could take you to gimbal lock, and we think it's a good idea to power up the commander's ball. We've got a four-stepper, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Okay, Go ahead.
Okay. Verify that you got AC power, in other words, the INVERTER 2 selected and the BUS TIE INVERTER 2 AC BUS A closed. We'll be under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, GASTA closed, commander FDAI, closed. On the AC BUS A, CBs GASTA closed, CONBIANDER FDAI closed. Over.
Okay. It's verify we have AC, which is panel 16 INVERTER 2 closed. CB INVERTER 2 closed. Then on panel 11 under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, we want the GASTA and the COMMANDER's FDAI breakers closed. Also under panel 11, AC BUS A GASTA and COMMANDER's FDAI breakers closed.
That's affirmative. Over.
Aquarius, Houston. After the OMNI switch, we would like you to get the ranging off, the VOICE switch to DOWN VOICE BACKUP, and the POWER AMP CB on 16 open. Over.
Okay. After the OMNI switch, we'll get the POWER AMP off and go back to DOWN VOICE BACKUP FTA and the RANGING off. It's your call.
Roger. Stand by.
Fred-o, we got about 2 minutes to the OMNI switch. You can go ahead and power the RANGING down and and the DOWN VOICE BACKUP, and we'll give you a call on OMNI switch. Over.
Okay.
How do you read Aquarius now on DOWN VOICE BACKUP?
Roger, Aquarius. We are reading you about the same, about 2-by.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Select FORWARD OMNI. Over.
...
Roger.
Do you read down there, Houston?
Apollo 13, Houston. We read you weakly. Go ahead.
Okay. Vance, if Buzz or Neil are around you might ask them if they had to use the AOT lamps to shoot the Sun like they did on 11.
Well, where's the ...
Right down below me here?
Fred, breaking in. You're very weak. Understand if Buzz or Neil are down here, you'd like to ask them if they used the AOT lamp to what? Over.
To see the Sun, Vance. It might be possible to see the reticle without even having the light on.
Oh, I see. See if it's possible to see the reticle without the light on. Okay. We'll make a check. And one other thing, you might move that rendezvous radar antenna to park any time now. You can start any time you want.
Okay.
... it's out of the way.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Jim, Neil is here. He advises that you will not need the lamp on for the Sun check but that you will need it on for the Earth check. Over.
Understand.
Okay. Let's park the radar. Are you ready?
Okay. Let me - First of all, let me see how we're doing here. That's going down. That's better. That's coming up. That's right. Let's - Okay. Let's park the radar. How - How long is it going to take?
Not too long. Okay, INVERTER 2 ... Here, hold the light for me, Jim. Right here on the ... panel. Hold it still. ... AC BUS A BUS TIE.
Okay.
AC BUS A.
Okay.
BUS TIE INVERTER 2.
BUS TIE INVERTER 2. PRO.
Okay. Panel 16 verify and select INVERTER 2.
Okay.
Okay. On CB 11, give me the RENDEZVOUS RADAR breakers, with 30-second spread.
Okay. ... at 15, I ...
Okay. ... 30 seconds.
Okay. Go ahead.
Right.
Okay. Thirty seconds. AC breaker.
Okay. Got a big dip.
Okay. Reach up here and give me the ... panel ...
Okay. She's pulled.
Okay. Panel 3, check the LGC.
LGC.
Okay. Give me a VERB 41 NOUN 72.
Still going good, right?
Okay. And they're all zips, 28300.
00.
Go.
... 16 72 ...
It's going now. ... signal light.
Right.
... is running away. Docking light.
What?
Command module docking light. Okay. You got them. They're in.
Okay. Two RENDEZVOUS RADAR breakers, pull them. ... ...
...
CB 16 INVERTER 2 open.
Okay.
You know that light on the command module ...?
Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
... get that thing ...
Roger. One correction. We think that the cheapest way for you to maneuver to change attitude is with minimum pulse ACA. That's to do the star mark.
We had - Okay. As soon as possible we'll get that star data ... we can get to maneuver attitude by using TTCA.
Roger.
And, just out of curiosity, we got rid of the radar very nicely. It's hanging right in the middle of the - the forward digit is the docking light on the command module. Can you believe that? I don't think it will hurt our Sun check, but it'll sure make P52 ...
Sorry, Jim, but we are only reading you about 1 by 1.
Look at that big ... out there.
... out there.
It looks like a piece of wrapping for ... line.
You're watching that. Right?
It's going to get smaller before it gets larger.
Okay. I guess they can close it.
Okay. Did you read your figures ...?
Yes.
Okay.
Okay. ... P22. What's our next time line?
... about 73:30 ...
Did you get that or did he give it to you?
He gave it to me.
Okay. Because I thought he said 2 degrees per second. Like to check on that.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
Go ahead, Fred.
Okay. Jim thinks he heard something different than I copied on the DAP load. Is REGISTER 1 supposed to be 31120?
That's correct, Fred. That was to be 31120.
Okay.
Okay.
And, Houston, how do you want us to ...
... 3, 2, C and D, 2, 2, 0, ... Okay. We're at high bit rate.
Okay. ... give ... a call.
Well, they probably don't know what to do there.
Okay. And, Houston; Vance.
Go ahead, Jim.
Just want to get a time check with you. When do you want us to start powering up the ball? We just got to our PTC attitude.
Understand you'd like to know when to power up the -
We think to take about 15 - -
...
Yes. The ball inside the maneuver, we think it will take us about 15 minutes to get there. We'd like you to confirm that.
Stand by 1.
... god damn ...
What would that take to use ... use the command module or what? To load the PLSS ...
... ... Let's see, about 10 or 11 ...
When is that Sun check time supposed to take place?
74 hours 29 minutes ...
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I'd just like to do the little Sun check. Do you want me to do it now?
Jim, Roger. We just came up with a maneuver time of approximately 15 minutes, so if you start any time between now and about the next 2 minutes it would get you into attitude by 73:15. Over.
Roger. We'll start the maneuver at this time. Okay. Let's go.
Okay. SPS ... - -
If we don't keep working, we'll never develop it.
... now, Power up your FDAI.
All right.
Okay. Give me 16 ... Apparently. ... panel 11 ...
Yes.
... GASTA.
Okay.
And COMMANDER FDAI.
Okay.
And on your H<sub>A</sub>, yaw right side, lift main line ... ...
Okay.
Now ... 30 second ... Okay. Now let's get ready to run this back. ...
Okay.
Okay. DEADBAND OPTION.
Okay. ... ...
Okay ... on this ... vector. Okay, R<sub>1</sub> plus 45498 ... Okay, plus 190 ..., plus 08256. Okay, now we show zips ... Okay. VERB 62 ENTER. Okay. ... and the main ... in AUTO ... ...
Houston, are you monitoring our P52 technique?
- - Apollo 13 - -
Roll, yaw, roll, pitch, and yaw.
Jim, that's negative. We don't have any data on you. Low bit rate.
We don't have high bit rate.
Houston, do you read Aquarius?
Roger. Reading you, Fred. Go ahead.
Go ahead. Houston is reading you.
Houston, Aquarius.
Reading you loud and clear. Go ahead.
Are you monitoring our P52 technique?
That's negative, Jim. We do not have high bit rate data on you now. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
And be advised, Vance, that we are getting several echos in our COMM downlink here.
Roger. We'll check into it.
... ... and ... alinement.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, request you give us high bit rate now. We might be able to fix you up on the 120 antenna.
Okay. High bit rate.
Roger.
And, zero, zero, zero.
Yes.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Fred, we can't lock up on your high bit rate. Request you go back low bit rate.
Hey, we lost you there, Vance.
Roger. Advise, we are not locking up on your high bit rate, so you can go back low bit rate. Over.
Low bit rate.
Right here, Jim. There it is. Looks like it ...
I don't have all the confidence in the world in this Earth-Sun P52.
You know how many times I screwed up on my arithmetic.
Yes. Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Listen, I'm not.
We're ... going to be two diameters out, huh?
Yes.
Okay. Tell me what that technique is to get the lamp on, in case I don't see it.
They'll have to give you AC again and you punch in your breaker -Well, let's see - I've still got H<sub>P</sub> on for the FDAIs, so you're in business now. All you need is the lamp breaker, the AC BUS A AOT lamp breaker, that is.
Let me know when these start going. There's the Sun. Give me the - Give me the AOT.
Okay.
Never mind. I don't need it. Go ahead. I got it. Never mind.
Reticle brightness, want it up? Got the reticle?
I got the reticle ...
... Call it, Jack; you can see it better.
...
Okay.
... ...
... we got it a great big one.
Yes. I show it about maybe a third of a diameter to the left.
Okay. Take a look.
Check your needles. You're off in roll, Jim.
Pitch and yaw are in, but we're off in your roll needle. Better get that ...
Okay. It brings it in. Say when.
Okay. We got it. I think we got it. What diameter was it?
Yes. It's coming back in. Just a second.
Yes, yaw's coming back in.
Just about it.
Okay. Yaw is in ...
What have you got?
... upper right corner of the Sun.
We've got it.
You're hot ...
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. It looks like the Sun check passes.
We understand it checks out. We're kind of glad to hear that.
It's not quite centered, but it's about a diameter, a little bit less than a diameter, just to one side.
Sounds good.
Now. Let's get the AOT lamp on.
Okay, Jim.
Which ... to get the AOT lamp on?
Okay. Pull the - your AOT lamp breaker.
Got it.
Okay. And, Houston, can we proceed with our powerdown now? Getting the ball back off and AOT lamp, et cetera, AC secured.
Stand by on that one for a minute, Fred.
- - the ball ... get back to - Okay. What we'd like now, I guess, is the next attitude to go to, Vance, and we will work on getting there while we still have the ball.
Roger. We copy.
...
Okay. Seventy-four hours.
Yes. We're not there yet, really. I've got 11 minutes to check ... out.
Yes. Bring your ... down.
Get set. Keep ... It's better in here. Slow now ...
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, in a moment we will have an attitude for you to go to, and recommend that you keep your FDAI up while maneuvering to that attitude. After you get there, then we will have you widen the deadband and eventually go into a PTC about the burn attitude.
You were cut off slightly, Vance.
Roger. We will have an attitude for you to maneuver to in a moment. And you should leave your FDAI up for that. The attitude is as follows if you are ready to copy. Over.
Got the book.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. This is FDAI attitudes for the maneuver. Yaw 060 degrees, pitch 083 degrees, roll 272 degrees.
Let's not read that in the R<sub>1</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>. I don't want VERB 69 twice. I want VERB 49, 58g's so I can fly the needle.
Jim. Those are not VERB 49 angles. Those are strictly FDAI attitudes. Over.
Okay. I understand, Vance. It's much easier if the ball is up to fly the needles; that gives me a drift of VERB 49, 58g maneuver. We could fly that manually.
Stand by. We'll try to get you a VERB 49 angle.
Flying on maneuvers.
...
On that last check, what did it look like?
... ... ...
This is the first three-man LM we've had.
Apollo 13, Houston.
And, Vance, which - What hack you got now on GET?
Okay. Stand by on that, Fred. First, let me read up your VERB 49 attitude, if you are ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Okay. Yaw 27100, pitch 35500, roll 33000. Over.
Ask him if you keep it in AUTO maneuver there.
Okay. VERB 49, yaw plus 27100, pitch plus 35500, roll plus 33000. And do you think it's cheaper to manually make that maneuver or take the 0.2-degree range and go in AUTO maneuver?
Fred, we're recommending AUTO maneuver. Over.
Okay. AUTO maneuver, and could you give me a GET right now.
Okay. I understand you want GET of the burn. Stand by 1.
That's negative, Vance. What is your clock reading right now?
Okay. When I give you a hack, it will be 73:59, and that's about 40 seconds away.
Okay. I think we will make one last check there with the half-unit vectors for 74 hours before we leave this attitude.
Okay. And I'm going to calculate in the 2 seconds in giving you the time hack coming up on 73:59:00 when I give the mark. Okay. Stand by.
MARK.
Looked good.
Okay. I understand you got it.
You want me to PROCEED one more time on that, Jack?
Roger. Yes, go ahead.
Oh, it's on; it's a center.
That's it, she's right on still. Okay. I have, too. That's better than I expected.
Okay. Let's do a VERB 74 and get out of here.
If we can. Go to P00? Okay. I'm going to go to -
...
737100. Roger. 35500, plus 33000. ...
Okay. That's - -
Yaw, pitch, and roll.
Let me see. No, that's yaw, pitch, and - Okay. Everything's ... ... That's roll, pitch, and yaw.
Roll, pitch, and yaw.
Everything ... yaw.
The roll's going to be down here, but the yaw will be off the bellyband. ... procedure, or don't you have a procedure?
Roll, pitch, and yaw, but drift's the one. That would be gimbal lock if it wasn't for being off ...
And, Houston, I see that this maneuver gives us a roll of 27172, a pitch of 08301. Is that what they gave us?
This is Houston. Please repeat.
Houston, did you give us VERB 49 in yaw, pitch, and roll, or register 1, 2, and 3?
We gave it as yaw, pitch, and roll.
Okay. We wrote it as roll, pitch, and yaw.
Okay, Jim. We read it to you as yaw, pitch, and roll, and we should have given it to you registers 1, 2, and 3; but we did not. So register 1 is 33000, register 2 is 35500, and register 3 is 27100.
Okay, Vance. Register 1 will be 33000, register 2 35500, register 3 27100.
Hey, Fred? Stand by on that.
Okay. Plus 27100. Okay. Stand by. Right now you can enter ...
Okay. Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. We sorted it out, and it is correct the way we gave you the first time. So, R<sub>1</sub> 27100, and in the LM, that's yaw; R<sub>2</sub> 35500, and that's pitch; R<sub>3</sub> 33000, and that's roll in the LM. Over.
I agree with you. Okay. 5018, it's there, and 5018, and that's what it will be. Okay.
That's right. That's VERB 49.
There are 25. 25, ENTER.
Okay. Plus 27100, plus 35500, plus 33000.
Okay.
So far we're ... what can we do about it?
Apollo 13, Houston. You better watch that middle gimbal. Over.
Roger. We're watching that middle gimbal. We have as a roll, 27172. Our yaw is - that's register 3 - 3300. How did we get this?
And, Apollo 13. We have a procedure for you describing how to widen the deadband to 5 degrees later on. But stand by for that.
Apollo 13, you're heading for gimbal lock. You better stop everything.
Yes, we're back in ATT HOLD now. We're trying to stop it.
Roger.
I'm going to roll it.
Can you give it a roll up now, Jim?
Yes.
I don't understand why we got that.
Apollo 13, Houston. It looks like VERB 49 maneuver will just take you right through there. You're going to have to go around it. Over.
Okay. That's what we're in the process of doing.
Si, si.
We're manually working our way around it, Vance.
Okay.
Pitch is 083.
How do I work my way around it? I'm 58g's, and I want yaw 231, right? I think they screwed up on our - our numbers again.
Zero out the needles; we're heading that way, and then we'll stop and talk about it.
No. Pitch is 83. Pitch should be up here. ... ... What's the number, 552?
Pitch should be 83 degrees. ...
Roll 232; that's a long way to roll, ... yaw is 62 ...
... yaw.
... roll.
...
Okay. What's that read; there's 180.
Roger.
... is over here. Houston, 13.
Go ahead, 13.
There's something screwed up on our burn attitude. We're not getting the proper readings on the ball and the needles are centered. I'm not too sure what's wrong. Let's go through this procedure again.
Okay. Stand by 1. Let us look at it.
- - angles you gave us, Vance, aren't correlating the VERB 49 numbers.
Okay. We'll check into it.
We know the ball is good. Why don't we just get a 40?
You better watch out; it's heading that way.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. To answer your last question, do you have PGNS checklist page 57 handy?
Right, we do. I'll check it.
As soon as you open up to that, I'll explain it.
Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. Under VERB 49, crew-defined maneuver, the flashing 0622 are the angles that we gave you that were loaded. The flashing 5018 actually represents FDAI angles, and so what you read on 5018 should - -
Right. I understand.
- - should not correspond with NOUN 22.
Yes. We appreciate that, Vance. It's just that right now we're trying to follow center needles that appear to be possibly taking us away from the place we know we want to be in the ball.
Okay, You're tending toward the gimbal lock area again. Heads up.
Roger.
There's our 83. - -
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
13, request you put in the POWER AMPL circuit breakers so that we can take a look at your angles.
You got it.
Thank you. And now high bit rate.
Okay, 13; we're getting your high bit rate now and taking a look at your angles.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim, we just took a look at your angles, and you're looking good here. Your PGNS is looking good. We can't yet explain the attitude error needle thing, but I suggest you continue on in your maneuver.
Roger. Okay. We've just about got roll.
13, Houston. We see you now in the AUTO maneuver. How are your error needles looking now?
Okay. They look like they are working their way in, Vance.
Okay. You think maybe they are working right now?
Yes. Because we got a 270-degree roll, our pitch and yaw needles are reversed.
Okay.
Say, how do you read, Vance? ...
Fred, you are starting to fade out. Request AFT OMNI, OMNI AFT.
Okay. You've got AFT OMNI.
Thank you.
13, Houston.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We appear to be there - at the burn attitude. And now do you want us to change the DAP?
Roger, Jim. We have a procedure to give you for widening the deadband to 5 degrees for the PTC in the next 3 or 4 hours, if you're ready to copy.
Okay, stand by.
Go ahead.
Okay. VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011, ENTER; 44, ENTER. Now, that's the procedure for widening the deadband to 5 degrees with the DAP. Later on, prior to the burn, you would return the deadband to 1.4 degrees, and if you're ready to copy, I'll read you that.
Stand by.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Okay. To return the deadband later to 1.4 degrees: VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011, ENTER; 200, ENTER. Over.
Okay, Vance. To widen the deadband, we'll enter a VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011, ENTER; 44, ENTER. Before the burn to go back to narrow deadband, it's VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER; 3011, ENTER; 200, ENTER.
Roger, Readback correct.
And, Houston, I'll guess we'll do this PTC in yaw, and do you want them all powered down?
Stand by.
Okay, Apollo 13. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, that's affirm. You'll be doing the PTC in yaw, and we'll give you a call at each time you change yaw - yaw attitude. Aside from that, request low bit rate off; then DOWN VOICE BACKUP OFF; then POWER AMPL OFF; and then FDAI OFF.
Okay, Vance. On the power down, we go low bit rate; DOWN VOICE BACKUP, we'll pull the POWER AMPL breaker; and we'll power down the FDAI and the AC.
That's affirm. And the AOT, too.
Okay, are you all set for old a -
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read DOWN VOICE BACKUP?
Reading you loud - loud and clear now, Fred.
Okay.
Oh, Vance, do you want to stay in this attitude for a certain length of time before we start maneuvering?
Roger. Jim, we'll keep you there for about an hour, and then we'll have our first 90-degree rotation.
Okay. How wide do I make the deadband?
Say again.
... the other OMNI's in.
Yes. My forward OMNI is in.
Apollo 13, Houston. Forward OMNI should be best.
We're there.
I don't see why the hell he ...
I know. I don't know. I don't know where that 5 degrees ...
Cut it.
...
Oh-h. ... that thing against the ...
I'm just going to try and close my eyes for a little.
Go ahead.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Fred, one - one point on the PTC requests that, about an hour or less from now when you make your 90-degree change, that you do it in PGNS AUTO as opposed to ATT HOLD. Reason is that if you're in ATT HOLD, it establishes a new null point each time you stop the - the maneuver. Over.
Okay. You want us to make the maneuver with PGNS AUTO rather than the PGNS ATT HOLD. Is that right?
Yes. That's correct.
And, Fred, advise that it - it is a manual maneuver.
13, Houston. You'd be using X-axis override. It will be a manual maneuver, but with the PGNS AUTO mode.
Okay.
And if you're ready to copy, Charlie is going to be on in a minute with some recommended checklist changes for your upcoming burn. Over.
Okay. Stand by 1.
I'm going to erase this.
Hello, Aquarius; Houston. Do you read? Over.
Yes. Stand by 1 ...
Okay. Which book are you going to give me some words in, Charlie?
Houston, Aquarius. Which book do you want us to have out? contingency ...?
Houston. This is Houston, Aquarius. Say again. Over.
Houston, Aquarius. Which book do you want me to update here, Charlie, the contingency QR DPS?
Okay, Fred-o, we'd like you to get out the contingency checklist; turn to page 1, the 2-hour activation. Over.
Okay. I'm right there.
Okay. On page 1, the only thing we have to do is EPS Activation, step 2, CB(16) EPS: DISPLAY, CLOSE. Over.
Okay. On page 1, we need EPS DISPLAY, CLOSE, under EPS Activation, step 2.
Okay. Turning over to page 2, we'd like you to complete step 5 and step 6 with the following changes. POWER/TEMP MONITOR, AC BUS, INVERTER 2, then INVERTER 1. Fourth line CB(11), EPS: INVERTER 2, OPEN. Over.
Okay, on step number - or page 2, we should do step 5 and modify step 6 second line to read INVERTER 2, then INVERTER 1, to the last line of step 6 CB(11), EPS INVERTER 2, OPEN.
Okay. That will be on CB(16), Fred-o, but it's INVERTER 2 OPEN. Okay, on the Mission Timer Activation. Do step 1, correction, lines 1 and 2. Omit "set mission timer on CSM mark" and insert a VERB 16, NOUN 65, set mission timer. Over.
Okay. We'll do the Mission Timer Activation except we'll set it on VERB 16, NOUN 65.
Okay. Proceeding on to step, correction, page 3, CWEA checkout. Step 1, perform step 1. Warning lights will be ASCENT PRESS, CES AC, and CES DC. Under the caution lights, we may have a heater light. And that's all. Okay, perform - under the circuit breaker 16 - -
I can't understand you. I'll switch OMNIs.
Say again. Over.
I'm going to switch to OMNIs here, Charlie, you're starting to fade out.
Understand. Switching OMNIs. Over.
Okay. How do you read? ..., how do you read me now?
Okay, you're a little better. How me? Over.
Okay, Houston. Coming in loud and clear. I got your caution/warning checkout, step 1, do; the warning lights we'll have will be ASCENT PRESS, CES AC, CES DC. The only caution lights we may have will be a heater light and go ahead and proceed from there.
Okay, good. The component light, we won't have the H<sub>2</sub>O SEP. Okay, on CB(16) right under that, "HEATER DISPLAY, CLOSE," you can scratch that out. Perform all of step 2 and perform step 4 with the following changes. On panel 11, under AC BUS B, are you ready to copy? Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, under AC BUS B: S-BAND ANTENNA, OPEN; ORDEAL, OPEN. Under AC BUS A: TAPE RECORDER, OPEN. Row 2 under RCS SYSTEM A: MAIN SOV. Starting with a QUAD TCA; all four CLOSED. Under FLIGHT DISPLAYS: CROSS - COMMANDER CROSS-POINTER, OPEN; COAS, OPEN; ORDEAL, OPEN. For row 3 under HEATERS: RENDEZVOUS RADAR STANDBY, OPEN; LANDING RADAR, OPEN. Under STAB/CONTROL: ATTITUDE DIRECT CONTROL, CLOSE. Under ED: LOGIC POWER A, OPEN; and under LIGHTING: UTILITY, OPEN. Are you with me? Over.
Yes. I'm still with you, Charlie; go ahead.
Okay, Fred-o, good show. On row 4, starting with ECS: SUIT FAN 1, CLOSE; GLYCOL PUMP AUTO TRANSFER, CLOSE. Under COMM: VHF B TRANSMITTER, OPEN; VHF A RECEIVER, OPEN. Under PGNS: SIGNAL STRENGTH DISPLAY, OPEN; IMU OPERATE, CLOSE. Under EPS, row 5: CROSS TIE BUS, OPEN; and INVERTER 1, CLOSE. Over.
Okay, stand by just 1.
Okay, panel 11 configuration, top row: AC BUS B, I want the S-BAND ANTENNA, OPEN, ORDEAL, OPEN; AC BUS A, TAPE RECORDER, OPEN. Second row, under RCS SYSTEM A, I want MAIN SOV through QUAD 1 TCA, all CLOSED. COMMANDER'S X-POINTER under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, OPEN; COAS, OPEN; ORDEAL, OPEN. Third row: RENDEZVOUS RADAR STANDBY HEATER, OPEN; LANDING RADAR HEATER, OPEN. Under STAB/CONTROL: ATTITUDE DIRECT breaker, CLOSED; ED: LOGIC POWER A, OPEN; LIGHTING: UTILITY, OPEN. Under ECS: SUIT FAN 1, CLOSED; AUTO TRANSFER, CLOSED. Under COMM: VHF B TRANSMITTER, OPEN; VHF A RECEIVER, OPEN. Under PGNS: SIGNAL STRENGTH DISPLAY, OPEN; IMU OPERATE, CLOSED. Bottom row, EPS: CROSS TIE BUS, OPEN; INVERTER 1, CLOSED.
Roger, Fred. Good readback. Starting with panel 16. Under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, row 1: SE CROSS-POINTERS, OPEN; RCS SYSTEM Bravo - QUAD 1 TCA's, CLOSE; QUAD 2, CLOSE; QUAD 3, CLOSE; QUAD 4, CLOSE. Second row, under LIGHTING: FLOOD is your choice. You can either use them or not. Under ED: LOGIC POWER Bravo, OPEN; ECS: SUIT FLOW CONTROL, OPEN. Third row, under COMM: DISPLAY, OPEN; VHF A TRANSMITTER, OPEN; VHF B RECEIVER, OPEN; S-BAND ANTENNA, OPEN. Fourth row, under HEATERS: DISPLAY, OPEN; under EPS: INVERTER 2, OPEN. And that's it. Readback. Over.
Okay, panel 16, top row, FLIGHT DISPLAYS: SYSTEM ENGINEER CROSS-POINTER, OPEN; RCS SYSTEM B: QUADs 1 through 4 TCAs, all CLOSED. Second row, LIGHTING: FLOODS we'll probably have open - our choice. ED: LOGIC POWER B, OPEN; ECS: SUIT FLOW CONTROL, OPEN. Under COMM: DISPLAY, OPEN; VHF A TRANSMITTER, OPEN; VHF B RECEIVER, OPEN; S-BAND ANTENNA, OPEN. Bottom row, HEATERS: DISPLAY, OPEN. Under EPS: INVERTER 2, OPEN.
Roger. Good readback. Okay, continuing on. Nothing on page 6; nothing on page 7. Nothing on page 8 or 9. Nothing on page 10 or 11. On page 12, we want the - to perform - -
Hold it. Hold on just a minute, Charlie.
Okay.
Okay. Go ahead, page 12. I'm there.
Okay Fred-o. On page 12, we want the MSFN updates. We've got some vectors for you and a P30 pad. And we'll - when you get to that state, we'll let you know when we want to uplink. Okay. Under "AGS Activation and Self Test," perform the entire procedure. On page 13, under "AGS Aline," do step 1; under "DAP Set, Gimbal/Throttle Test," do step 1 with the following change. Under "THROTTLE CONTROL," we want it "AUTO." Over.
Okay. I'll catch up here. On page 12, you'll give us MSFN updates, some vectors, and a P30; and we're to do the entire "AGS Activation and Self Test." On page 13, we'll do the "AGS Align" and under "DAP Set, Gimbal/Throttle Test," step 1, I've changed "THROTTLE CONTROL MANUAL" to "THROTTLE CONTROL AUTO."
Good readback. Turning over to page 14, step 2, we want you to change the DAP NOUN 46 to 31021. Then after the NOUN 47, insert "VERB 34, ENTER." Over.
Okay. On page 14, a VERB 48, DAP load, NOUN 46 changed to 31021. I assume you will give us any updated weights if we need any, and after the NOUN 47, a "VERB 34, ENTER." So, I - you're saying our gimbals look all right.
That's affirmative on the gimbals, Fred. Nothing else on page 14. Proceed to page 15, and under "RCS CHECKOUT," we'd like to scratch that wording and just say "Verify the following switches: GUIDANCE CONTROL, PGNS;" step 3 - correction - it's line 3, change "ATTITUDE CONTROL (3)" to "MODE CONTROL;" "MODE CONTROL (BOTH)" to "AUTO." Verify ACA PROP, LMP ENABLE; ACA/4 JET, LMP ENABLE; TTCA/TRANSLATION, LMP, ENABLE. That is all on page 15. Over.
Okay. On page 15, we'll change the heading "RCS CHECKOUT" to "Verify following switches," and those switches are "GUIDANCE CONTROL, PGNS;" third line, "ATTITUDE CONTROL (3)" to "MODE CONTROL" now; and then "MODE CONTROL (BOTH)" to "AUTO" and ACA PROP, LMP ENABLE; ACA/4 JET, LMP ENABLE; and TTCA/TRANSLATION, LMP ENABLE.
Roger. Now stand by 1.
Okay. Hand me the eyepiece. I got Scorpio.
You have?
Yes. And Antares.
Where's the other one? I'll put it back in here.
Hello, Aquarius. Houston. On activation page 16, if you are ready. Over.
Okay. Stand by just 1, Charlie. Jim's going to fish around and see if he's got - he thinks he's got Scorpio. I'm the AOT now. Okay, Charlie, go ahead. I'm on 16 now.
Okay. Fred. On page 16, perform the "Docked DPS BURN (PGNS)," that entire sequence down - down through the end of the page, except cross out that "CSM Maneuver to Burn Attitude, then CMC - FREE." Over.
Yes. I kind of deduced that one, Charlie. Page 16, "Docked DPS BURN (PGNS)," except we'll forget the CSM maneuver.
Okay. And you can forget the "APS Follow-up," too. Okay, on page 17, perform all of the AGS entries and at 4 minutes, we got a change. First line, CB(16) INVERTER 3, CLOSE; line 2, scratch out "Select INVERTER 1." At - proceeding on down the page, after "ATTITUDE MONITOR," we'd like you to place the RATE SCALE to "25 degrees a second." Okay, proceeding on down four more lines to "BALANCE COUPLE," we'd like to turn "BALANCE COUPLE-OFF." That's to keep the upfiring jets off of the CSM, in case we have to damp any rates in AGS, though we don't think we will. Then perform the rest of that page as written. Over.
Okay, on page 17. Do the AGS load at minus 4 minutes; it's CB(11), INVERTER 2, CLOSE, and scratch "Select INVERTER 1." RATE SCALE changed to "25 degrees a second." "BALANCE COUPLE," we'll turn "OFF;" and, incidentally, on the AGS dampen rates point, it brings up the discussion we'd had before, Charlie, on takeovers. You might discuss what it's going to cost us DELTA-V-wise, if we get a control problem, to just shut her off and it take 30 minutes to regroup for a good manual burn.
Fred, we already got that story for you, pretty well in hand. We're reviewing it right now. And I'd like to defer that question until later on. Basically, we're just going to shut down and take what we got, and we got a midcourse of about - the maximum of 5 foot per second, anywhere in the burn to get back to free return. That - that's basically the story. We'll give you the mission rules for this burn momentarily. I'd like to proceed on to page 18, at minus 1 minute, scratch "MASTER ARM - ON." Stand by.
Okay, on page 18, and I've already done that at 1 minute; "MASTER ARM - ON," I'll scratch - -
- - Slipped that ... and I won't have anything to do - -
- - I've already scratched "CB(16) ABORT STAGE - CLOSE" for the previous burn.
Okay. We want you to close the CB(16) ABORT STAGE. Over.
Okay. You got some special reason for that?
Yes, sir. We like - In case we don't get a manual ON - I mean, an AUTO ON, we're going to back up using the abort stage in the descent-engine command override at ignition plus 1 second. Backing up to page 17, at minus 4 minutes, you read "CB(11) INVERTER 2," it should be "CB(16) INVERTER 2." Over.
Okay, I got you, Charlie. 17, "CB(16) INVERTER 2, CLOSE."
Okay, back to page 18. We'll continue on as is at 30 seconds, 10 seconds, 7 seconds, minus 5 seconds. At "ignition," no ignition and we'll add here, "no ignition, START pushbutton - push; still no ignition, DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, ON." Over.
I got it out there, but I can't get to see it closer.
Okay, on channel - on page 18, right on down the line, everything holds until after "ignition"; "if no ignition, START pushbutton - push; still no ignition, DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE switch ON."
Okay, good readback, Fred-o. At plus 15 seconds, scratch "MASTER ARM - OFF;" and at - proceeding on down to "At Engine Cutoff," it's - after the "MODE CONTROL: PGNS to ATT HOLD," we'd like a "VERB 76," and the "Damp Excessive Rates Via the LM Y, Z Translation." Over.
Okay, scratch "MASTER ARM - OFF" at plus 15, and "At Engine Cutoff" after "MODE CONTROL: PGNS - ATT HOLD," we want a "VERB 76 ENTER," and "Damp Excessive rates Via LM Y, Z translation." And a question on the - propellant quantity, we expect it to get down below 37 percent on this burn. Does that compare with that burn time when you get down to it.
That's negative. At this - this burn, we're looking at - not reaching 37 percent, so I don't think we'll have to perform that step. We will verify that for you. Okay. One other statement: "At Engine Cutoff, if manual start, then at 30 feet per second to go, throttle to 40 percent. At DELTA-V equals zero, stop pushbutton, push." Over.
Okay, Charlie. If a manual start, that was throttle to 40 percent at - Was that 30 foot per second to go?
That's affirmative. At 30 foot per second to go.
Okay. Then it's stop pushbutton at VGO equals zero?
That's affirmative. What we want to do, if we got a manual start, we're going to have to shut down manually, and, to get a better guided cut-off at 30 foot per second to go, we want you to throttle at 40 and acceleration is within reason there, and we feel like we can get a good manual cut-off. Over.
Okay.
Okay. Now, Fred, that was good in the checklist. That's all. We'll have the powerdown checklist for you momentarily, and we'd like to ask you if you plan to use the DPS burn card. If you do, we have some changes to that. Over.
Okay. Let me get ahold of this ... right now.
Let me know when you are ready to copy. Over.
I'm ready.
Okay. The first two lines are okay. CB - third line, CB(11) and (16): STAB/CONTROL, all CLOSED except CB(11) AEA, OPEN; ABORT STAGE, OPEN; AELD, OPEN. CB(16) AELD, OPEN. Over.
Okay, on the DPS burn card, third line should read CB(11) and (16): STAB/CONTROL CBs all CLOSED, except CB(11) AEA, OPEN; ABORT STAGE, OPEN; AELD, OPEN; CB (16) AELD, OPEN.
Okay. Good readback. Proceeding on down the page. "BALANCE COUPLE" switch, "BALANCE COUPLE OFF." Okay, down to the TTCA - it's the last line before minus 2 minutes - "TTCA COMMANDER THROTTLE, MINIMUM; LMP TTCA to JETS." At minus 2 minutes, scratch "400 plus 1." At minus 1 minute, scratch "MASTER ARM, ON." At minus 10 seconds, add "MANUAL ULLAGE." At plus 5 seconds, scratch "DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, ON;" add "TTCA, 40 percent." Okay, the same comments apply about the manual start: "At the ignition time, if no start, manual START pushbutton, push; if still no start, DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, ON." And the same comments apply to shutting down at manual start. Over.
Okay. The same comments. I'll start at the top again here. Okay. "BALANCE COUPLE" should be changed to "OFF." Under TTCA, it should be "LMP TTCA" to "JET." Scratch "400 plus 1" at minus 2; scratch "MASTER ARM, ON" at minus 1. Add at minus 10 seconds "MANUAL ULLAGE"; add ignition - can add the comment about "If no start, START pushbutton, push; still no start, DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, ON." At the plus 5-second point, scratch "DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, ON," and add "TTCA to 40 percent," and the same comment applies at engine stop to perform.
We really don't use this card at that time.
Roger, Fred-o. Now we aren't - also at minus 30 seconds, we aren't looking at an AGS burn so you can scratch "ABORT pushbutton, push," and at DELTA-V equal to zero, scratch "ABORT pushbutton, reset." Over.
Okay. Minus 30 for AGS burn, "ABORT pushbutton, push" is scratched, and at DELTA-V equals zero, "ABORT pushbutton, reset" is scratched.
Okay, you got it, babe. We'll have some mission rules for you momentarily, and the powerdown checklist and also a PTC setup. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim. Over.
Roger. Be advised I'm now seeing Antares and Nunki in the AOT, and I just wanted to know whether you want me to try to do a P52.
Roger. Stand by. We copy the stars you are seeing. Stand by on a P52.
Not very far apart. Put the card back up, Jim - -
It's better than Antares and Shaula.
Yes. Sure is. That's right.
We got pretty good ... I'll do an AUTO P52 to Antares. That's the way I'll get it up there.
Hey, Houston - correction - Aquarius, Houston. We're satisfied with our present alinement. We don't want you to waste any more RCS gas trying to do this P52, and be advised you guys are hot mike, if you haven't heard. Over.
Okay, understand.
How's your memory there, Charlie?
Okay, we're putting Vance back on. Stand by.
What was that - -
Okay, okay, let's go back to that P52 ... now the attitude.
The burn attitude?
Yes. I want to make sure I got it.
Oh, you strayed off?
Yes.
Okay. ... Okay. You want these numbers? Or do you want the numbers from these.
What?
Pads. You got the G&N dictionary?
I got 13 20 going now.
Wait a minute.
... Just a ... These are those 13 20 angles here. Up here. Right here.
Hey, great.
One on. And Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Fred.
Oh, about how long we got before we're going to have to go to work here, Vance. Kind of like to get a bite to eat, maybe.
Okay. We have a - a couple of pads to give you and stand by. Let's - we'll check to see if we have anything else.
Hold on to that, baby. Where's that G&N book? You got it over there?
Here we go. Here, you want me to start copying - -
- - ... the bag - -
- - off there.
Aquarius, Houston.
No, you've got it right here.
Go ahead.
Okay. About all we have to do is to send up your state vectors and target loads, and that will have to wait a couple of minutes until we get ready to do so. And if you're ready to copy, I can give you the P30 maneuver pad for PC plus 2, and after that, probably you should eat and then we'll regroup again to send up other things. Over.
Okay. I'm ready to copy a P30, a PC plus 2.
Okay. Okay, this is a preliminary P30 LM maneuver PC plus 2. Starting NOUN 33: 079:27:40.07; plus 0819.2, minus 0020.0, minus 0218.9; NA; plus 0020.9, 0848.2; 420, 274, 082; plus 0820.3, minus 0020.0, minus 0215.0. Comments. Ullage is two jets for 10 seconds. CSM weight, 62480. LM weight 33576. And the following is the DPS throttle profile: 5 seconds at minimum followed by 21 seconds at 40 percent, and the remainder at MAX. Over.
Okay. PC plus 2. 079:27:40.07; plus 0819.2, minus 0020.0, minus 0218.9; NA; plus 0020.9, 0848.2; 420, 274, 082; plus 0820.3, minus 0020.0, minus 0215.0; the rest N/A. Under remarks: ullage, two jets 10 seconds; CSM weight 62480; LM weight 33576. DPS throttle profile: 5 seconds at idle; 21 seconds at 40 percent; remainder at MAX.
Roger; that's correct, Fred. If you'll take out a maneuver pad, I'll give you some landing information. Over.
Okay, you're talking in the CSM update book?
Yes, that's affirm.
You got it right here. Make sure and scratch the ... - -
... - -
- - though.
Okay, which - which one we want? P37?
What kind of a maneuver pad do you want, Vance?
This is a CSM maneuver pad for - to monitor PC plus 2. And it's going to be mainly blank except I want to give you your NOUN 61 latitude and longitude range to go for the EMS and that sort of thing.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, at the top, purpose is monitor PC plus 2; everything is blank until you get down to NOUN 61. Latitude as follows: minus 21.47, minus 165.00; 1166.0, 36291, 142:39:20. Over.
Okay, monitor PC plus 2 pad. NOUN 81: minus 21.47, minus 165.00; 1166.0, 36291, 142:39:20.
Roger; that's correct, Fred-o. And we - now would like to get you in a configuration to uplink your state vector and target load. So, if you're ready to copy, I have some circuit breaker changes for you. Over.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, circuit breaker panel 11 UPDATA LINK, CLOSE; PRIMARY POWER AMPL, panel 16, CLOSE; VOICE FUNCTION to VOICE; RANGE - RANGING FUNCTION to RANGING; TM bit rate, HI; and then P00 and DATA.
Okay, we're now in P00 and DATA, and switches and breakers are configured. You got it.
Okay, thank you. You're coming in loud and clear.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Hey, Jim, I have about three things. First thing, the computer is yours again. The second thing, no PTC maneuvering will be required from now until burn, so you can just sit in the burn attitude. And the third thing is we'd like to back out of this procedure we just put you into to updata link, which would mean going from TM bit rate HI back to LO, RANGING to OFF, VOICE to DOWN VOICE, PRIMARY POWER AMPL to CLOSE.
Hold up, Vance.
Okay.
We have a PROGRAM ALARM, Vance. 1106.
Stand by - -
- - that high bit rate.
Okay, that apparently was just my putting the UPDATA LINK switch OFF that set that bit.
Roger. We concur on that. And I'll read this back to you a little more slowly, Fred.
Okay, are you ready to copy?
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. TM bit rate to LO; RANGING to OFF, VOICE to DOWN VOICE, PRIMARY POWER AMPL to off - that's on panel 16 - and - or OPEN - and circuit breaker 11 UPDATA LINK to CLOSE - or to OPEN. Over.
Okay, Vance, how do you read on DOWN VOICE BACKUP now?
Okay, Fred, reading you loud and clear now.
Okay. I've got the POWER AMPL off, DOWN VOICE BACKUP, PCM to LO bit rate, and the UPDATA LINK breaker on 11 is pulled.
Okay. Copy. Thank you.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. On this last readback, we'd just like to verify that the PRIMARY POWER AMPL was pulled opened. Over.
That's affirm. I used the breaker on 16, PRIMARY S-BAND POWER AMPL breaker is OPEN.
Okay. Thank you.
Boy, we must be getting pretty close to the Moon.
What's that?
It's in a ATT HOLD.
Five degrees.
Hey, Jack. Bring me down one of the ...
And ...
... need two of them, I guess ...
...
Yes. I've been meaning to tell you about that, yes.
You know where this ... water?
What's that?
You know where this ... water?
Where?
The LGC.
...
...
... there she is ...
Pretty close? How's the hoses coming?
That screen goes - goes on - Fred's hose up there.
Yes. Here, take that one. ... another few minutes ...
Let's not forget to haul these out of here.
Thank you.
Get the hose screens?
Yes.
I'll ...
Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?
Hello, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
Aquarius, Houston. Loud and clear.
Okay. Vance, I guess I understood you all were amassing a couple of - list of things that you were thinking about later on - we'd be taking back from the LM across into the CSM. A couple of items to add to that list, we've pilfered the - the intake hose screens out of the CSM and we have them mounted on the LM hoses now to catch the debris in here. We probably ought to take those back.
Okay. We got that. Intake hose screens.
I guess that item isn't going to change your c.g. too much, Fred-o.
Let's hope not.
... command module water.
Yes. No, ...
Yes.
... Get out one of those big ... bags.
Much debris in there?
...
Trying to put debris in?
Yes.
... Jim. Ready to go.
How's that for ... (laughter).
... didn't see any ...
Yes. Oh, what I'd like to do is find out how many - Yes - What happened to the two little midcourses that's got to be with this vehicle.
Yes. ...
Now we just take the CSM and strip it down. Start putting the ... stuff in here.
Why are you worrying about that? Why are you worried about stripping down the vehicle?
Well, you don't want - You don't want the drogue and the probe in.
Oh, yes.
And, you do want room for the PLSSs. So, we'll grab this ... suit valve and ... them in there.
...
Well, the suit ... oxygen ... the cabin.
...
(Clears throat) We're not planning to reenter with suits.
... a suit would help you out is for protection.
Yes, ...
They work on the REPRESS valve.
Yes, ...
You know ... suit ...
Breathe through the canister.
...
Yes, breathe through the canister.
My job is to maintain ...
You got all those things ...?
Roger.
...
Yes, I think they forgot that.
Sun must be coming back.
Yes. ...
Yes, I got two stars, circling back, Nunki and Antares ... back up again.
Actually, you can see ...
What? Huh?
That's the one you put up there, ... I would like to ...
... to trade it in.
...
Doesn't that also fit this big container back here?
...
That's a little ...
I wouldn't mind - ... ...
Okay. ...
... seems to me.
Guaranteed to work.
Okay. ...
Hey, can't you pilfer more there? Yes. ...
... what you do - what you do, you put your -
Not bad ...
Now, let's see, this burn's ... to our back, I suppose. Let's hope it works.
Now, let's see. What should we be doing here now?
Okay. The next thing is power for the burn. Did they give you a time to start powerup?
No. ...
Yes, we ought to get a ... You know, we ought to get ... - -
They will.
- - ...
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Go, Aquarius.
Let's just recap the situation now. We're not going to do any more PTC. We'll maintain this attitude. You have already updated us on P30 load. We would like from you an LOS time, and a powerup start time for the PC plus 2. And an AOS time.
Okay. We copy that.
We're going to also get back with you shortly, Jim, for - with some burn guidelines for PC plus 2.
All right. Very well.
Have they powered up the mission timer - the event timer?
...
Oh, I see. Are they going to?
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, we were just discussing burn star monitoring and we were curious to know if you can see Nunki in detent 2 at this time. Over.
That's affirmative. I can see Nunki in detent 2.
Okay. Thank you. Roughly, in what part of the field of view?
Nunki is in the upper right-hand corner.
Okay. Thank you.
And Scorp - And Antares is barely visible in the bottom of the field of view.
Okay.
...
Hey, I bet I know how I could get an alinement. Give them a cursor spiral angle. Instead of maneuvering the spacecraft, I'll give them cursor spiral.
Do that for AGS and ...
... How's the ...?
Houston, for what it's worth, we can probably give you a cursor spiral angle on Nunki and possibly Antares or more than likely Shaula.
Roger, Jim. According to our calculations, Nunki should be, at burn time, pretty close to the center of the AOT. We've been talking that possibility over.
Roger.
Also, as a matter of general interest, the Sun should be in - at the bottom part of the CDR's window at the bottom of the LPD vertical line.
Be at Tig|T<sub>ig</sub> which is at - -
That's affirm.
It must be that - You're right, because it's behind us now.
Wait a minute, [...] holding insertion attitude.
Yes, we're not at the Tig|T<sub>ig</sub> attitude.
Oh.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, whenever you're through eating and ready to copy the info, I can send you the burn rules.
Do you want this?
Write them right on - ...?
Why don't you write them right in here?
Okay.
Okay. I'll start on that.
Okay, Vance.
Go ahead.
We're all set to go.
Okay. Okay. First of all, general philosophy is that these rules should be similar to LOI mode I abort with the tight limits. Now, I'll go through them one by one for you to copy. Okay. You should shut down, if any of the following happen. Thrust monitor readout, 77 percent or below; DPS propellant tank pressure - that's the inlet pressure - onboard readout, 160 or below; fuel to OX DELTA-P, greater than 25 psi - and that would have to be a ground call to you - attitude error plus or minus 10 degrees, with the exception of the start transient; attitude-rate limits, plus or minus 10 degrees a second. And you should shut down if you get any of the following alarms: ENGINE GIMBAL, ISS, plus PROGRAM ALARM, LGC, CES DC, and if you get an inverter light after switching inverters. Are you with me?
Roger.
Okay. - -
Affirmative.
And proceeding on. If, during the burn, the engine stops, if you have a flashing NOUN 97, you should PROCEED, then ullage, ENGINE START to PUSH, and DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE ON. Okay. Now just general information. If you didn't burn PC plus 2, probably P - P plus 4 would be the earliest MCC. AGS is going to backup in a rate-fail mode only, which you know. We're talking over the star check. Will have to get back with you on that. If, for some reason, there is no PC-2, you have a free-return trajectory with the landing at 152:02:00, and that would be after a small midcourse-5, which would probably be around 4 feet per second at 93 hours. And you have recovery forces in the Indian Ocean; you're in good shape there. And the Indian Ocean is where this landing would be. Okay. You still with me?
Roger.
Okay. After - -
Yes. I'm with you.
Okay. After PC plus 2, there are no trim requirements; and, if you have a shutdown during PC plus 2, subsequent midcourse maneuvers required with - Well, the earliest one would be PC plus 4. If you don't do a PC plus 2, but we still want to do one - MCC later. At PC plus 4, the increase in DELT - in DELTA-V, or the penalty, would be about 24 feet per second, with a landing in the mid-Pacific at 142:46:30. Now, you should expect new pads, state vectors, and targets for PC plus 2 at about GET 78. Over.
Tell them to stand by.
Stand by, Vance.
Okay.
Okay. How do you read?
Loud and clear.
Okay. Burn rules. We should shut down for the following: if we have the thrust monitor at 77 percent or below; number 2, if the DPS propellant ullage pressure is less than 160 psi; 3, if the fuel oxidizer DELTA-P is greater than 25, and that'll be a ground callout; 4, if the attitude error is plus or minus 10 degrees except for starting transients. Okay. Rate limits are plus or minus 10 degrees per second. And we're to shut down with the following alarms: an ENGINE GIMBAL light, an ISS with a PROGRAM ALARM, an LGC, a CES DC, and an inverter light, if it's still on after we've tried switching inverters. If, during the burn, the engine shuts down when the NOUN 97 flashes, we should PRO, do manual ullage, and START pushbutton, push, and DESCENT ENGINE COMMAND OVERRIDE, open. If we don't do a PC-2, our next burn will it be at PC-4 for an added 24 foot per second. We'll land mid-PAC at 142:46:30. Okay. We'll have the AGS up for backup rate command, or rate damping, I guess. And the free return that we're on, if we don't - that we're on now, if we don't do PC-2 or 4, lands us at 152:02:00 in the Indian Ocean. And there's no trim requirements on this burn, and we should expect a new uplink and a new final maneuver pad from you at 178 hours.
78.
Okay. I'm sorry, 1 - Yes, 78 hours. It only seems like it's been that long.
I can understand.
Okay, Fred. Your readback was correct.
Okay.
Okay. And, Vance, did you ever have any LOS/AOS times, and - and a startup time for us to jump into this activation checklist?
Okay. Let me - Let me poll the house again on that one.
What?
Okay. One word is that the - In an optimum fashion there, going through that 2-hour activation generally took somewhere from about an hour and 15 to an hour 20.
Okay. I guess then we ought to allow you a little more than that, huh?
No, I was thinking that we don't have to do about four pages of it, that we probably need just about that, and that will make up for the difference of any added time we need maneuvering et cetera.
Okay.
We'll need a - Can I get a flashlight? You got a flashlight. We might need a spare flashlight - Yes. Okay. We might need a spare flashlight: have you got one? Okay. Okay. The Sun has gone ... down.
Man, look at those stars. Houston.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Roger. We are in the shadow of the Moon now. The Sun is just about set as far as I can see and the stars are all coming out.
Okay. And if you are ready to copy, we have LOS/AOS times for you.
Flashlight. Okay.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. LOS 77:08:35, AOS 77:33:10. Sunrise - First I'll give you sunset which is past, but that was supposed to be at 76:32:45 and sunrise 77:16:48.
Okay. LOS at 77:08:35, AOS at 77:33:10. Sunset at 76:32:45, sunrise at 77:16:48.
Roger. We'll get back with you on the powerup time and, if you're ready to copy, have angles to load into NOUN 22 for your VERB 49 maneuver to burn attitude. Over.
Okay. Go ahead with the VERB 49 value.
Okay. R<sub>1</sub> plus 27210, R<sub>2</sub> plus 35570, R<sub>3</sub> plus 33010. Second item, as you know, due to maneuver with a PROCEED and a PROCEED; and, after your attitude, a reminder that P40 will not set you back to a narrow deadband. To get back to the 1.40-degree deadband, you have to use the procedure I gave you, which is VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER, 3011, ENTER. And 200, ENTER.
Okay. VERB 49, register 1, plus 27218; register 2, plus 35570; register 3, plus 33010; and to get the narrow deadband back we want a VERB 21, NOUN 01, ENTER, 3011, ENTER, 200 ENTER.
Roger. And a correction on your - on your first number for register 1. That should be plus 27210. And another comment; after you get into the narrow deadband at that attitude, why, you might tell us where you see Nunki.
Roger. Will do, Vance.
Thank you.
Okay. And you corrected register 1; it's plus 27210.
Roger.
And would you like us to make that maneuver at this time?
It's down below us, isn't it?
Stand by.
Can't see it.
Can we have some more light in here now?
I have a light.
What do you see out your upper window?
Stars.
Yes. It looks like - looks like the light is coming from around those clouds.
Well, you won't get AOS/LOS until 77.
...
Yes.
...
Yes.
Let's see, AOS is at 2 hours before the burn?
Just about.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, we recommend you go ahead and make your VERB 49 maneuver, but just stay there in VERB 49 and don't go ahead to narrow the deadband just yet. And, when you're in that attitude, why, of course, then you can make your star check. And one other item is, I don't think we got back with you, but that hour 15 for powerup sounds fine with us.
Okay. At this time, I'll start my VERB 49 maneuver, but will not narrow the deadband, and we will take a look at Nunki. Okay, Vance.
Roger.
Almost, huh?
Jim? Jim?
...
No, it shouldn't.
...
It shouldn't.
I was below that ...
...
That's a good idea.
...
... how many lights you're going to see. You can coach Jim on that.
Sure. We're there.
Nunki?
Yes. I can just barely see it. I see Antares much better.
Why is the wide deadband on? Stand by. Is - Is Scorpio moving down?
What's that cloud I see over there?
I don't know. It looks like a Milky Way.
Just a -
Huh!
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. We have completed our maneuver. We're in our wide deadband, and Nunki is close to the top of my display of the AOT. Right now, Antares seems to be more closer towards the center. However, we are in our wide deadband.
Right; understand. We'll have to make a better check later, I guess.
I can't for the life of me figure out what that dark stuff is.
Yes. Did you look at it, Jack?
Yes. Okay. But I didn't recall what ...
See it there. Like two black clouds.
Well, you know what this burn is buying us; 10 hours.
Yes.
And how.
Might be a good idea.
Hey, that's pretty extensive, Jim. You can locate it and get it halfway through the ...
Strange.
It's on the AOT. Well, maybe not.
I don't think so.
I know what that is. That might be the debris that was thrown out there.
- - into the cloud?
It's all dark now.
From the explosion.
... we made a maneuver.
No, from our explosion.
Take a look. It covers a wide area. God, that dark cloud. ... Like a pair of contrails. Only if you switch the detent, they go on around. How long to LOS? Is that right?
I'd sure like to try the detent 2, but I guess our damn platform's okay, isn't it?
Yes.
Yes.
...
...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. We have a little over 2 minutes until LOS, and everything's looking good here.
Roger. Yes. I take it that we don't have to start our activations until we receive AOS from you.
Roger. That's correct.
You ... up our edibles? ... water? ...
Good morning, Houston. How do you read?
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Stand by for AOS.
Houston, how do you read Aquarius?
Aquarius, Houston. Reading you about 3 by 3.
Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?
Okay, Fred. Reading you fairly well now. How do you read?
Okay. I read you loud and clear, ...
Roger.
Jack, why don't you get the other ...
Well, go this way.
All right. We're going up on Mare Smythii, now.
We'll see where ... zooming off.
Oh, yes, yes, we're no longer 139 miles. We're leaving.
Yes, look at that curvature.
That might be Crisium ever there, Fred.
Oh, yes; way off on the horizon, there, yes.
Hey, if you want to use the 250? There's a beautiful shot of Tsiolkovsky which we very seldom have.
Well, at this stage of the game beggars can't be choosers, I guess.
Yes, and we can't afford the amps to use the heaters.
Here you go.
All right. You're in zero phase up here.
Are we - back to DOWN VOICE BACKUP?
What's that?
We DOWN VOICE BACKUP?
Yes.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Roger. We still want an activation start time for a burn.
Understand. You want a powerup time, is that affirm?
That's affirm.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. Look it. Let's get the cameras squared away; let's get all set to burn. We got one chance now.
Okay.
We're not going to hack it at 152 hours.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, regarding the start time for the powerup, you mentioned an hour and 15 minutes. We think that is adequate. This is crew preference depending on how much time you think you need. We would go along with an hour and 15 minutes - -
Okay - Okay, sounds good.
Okay, Fred-o. You been through most of that checklist for an hour? Let's get it out and ...
78 hours and ...
Okay. Let's ...
Hey, Jack. Did you ... camera back up ...?
Okay. Page 1.
Okay,
Page 2, I'm going to power up the ...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. We have about three items for you. We have a maneuver pad, P30 LM maneuver, again; and the maneuver pad for the CM for splashdown. We also have a checklist change with contingencies, - LM contingencies checklist. And, I'll stand by while you're gathering the books.
Okay. I'm at - I got the contingency book, so give me that one first.
Okay. Page 18 ...
Okay. I'm at page 18.
Okay. About half-way down. When propellant quantity equals 30 percent, or rather 37 percent, we would like to change that line to read - when time to go is equal to 10 seconds - Of course, the line under that remains the same then, DESCENT HE REG 1 to CLOSE.
Okay. When time to go equals 10 seconds, DESCENT HELIUM REG 1, CLOSE.
That's affirm. Before I start on the pads, another comment. The general indications that we gave you before about the Sun being in the commander's window and about stars in the AOT, such as that might be used as general indication for your attitude for the burn, that's all out the window. We are just going on the Sun check that we made earlier and we don't feel that we have information that is good enough to give you the star and the Sun in the window information.
...
Okay. You're very weak now. When you are ready to take the P30 LM maneuver pad, I'll be reading it up.
Okay. Go ahead with the ...
Okay. This is P30, LM maneuver pad, PC plus 2 hours, starting with NOUN 33, 079:27:38.30, plus 0833.0, minus 0050.9, minus 0213.9, N/A, plus 0020.5, 0861.5, 4:24, 272, 081, and the rest is N/A except for comments as follows. Ullage, two jets, 10 seconds; CSM weight, 62480; LM weight, 33452 and the DPS throttle profile is the same as before, 5 seconds at minimum, 21 seconds at 40 percent, and the remainder of the time at MAX. Over.
Okay, Vance. ... 079:27:38.30, plus 0833.0, minus 0050.9, minus 0213.9, N/A, plus 00205, 08615, 4:24, 272, 081 and the rest N/A. Ullage two jets 10 seconds, CSM weight 62480, LM weight 33452, DPS throttle profile same as before, 5 seconds, 40 percent for 21 seconds, 40 percent, and the remainder at MAX throttle ...
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. You're coming in about 1 by 1 now. Advise that I heard everything except the beginning NOUN 33 values and the comments. Please repeat the readback on those.
Okay. I'm going to UP with the POWER AMP here, Vance.
Houston, how do you read Aquarius now?
Hey, you're loud and clear now.
Okay. I got the POWER AMPS now, PC plus 2 hours, 079:27; 38.030, plus 08330, minus 00509, minus 02139, N/A, plus 00205, 08615, 4:24, 272, 081; rest N/A. Ullage two jets, 10 seconds, CSM weight 62480, LM weight 33452; DPS throttle profile the same, 5 seconds idle, 40 percent at 21 seconds. Remainder at MAX.
Roger. Forty percent for 21 seconds, I believe is what you read back. And all the rest is correct. Now, for the maneuver pad for the CSM. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay, Fred-o. This is maneuver pad monitor PC plus 2 hours; all N/A until you get to NOUN 61, latitude minus 21.65, minus 165.00, 1163.5, 36292, 142:39:22. Over.
Monitor plane change plus 2; NOUN 81 minus 21.65 minus 165.00, 1163.5, 36292, 142:39:22.
Roger. That was starting with NOUN 61, and that's correct.
By the way, Aquarius, we see the results now from 12's seismometer. Looks like your booster just hit the Moon, and it's rocking it a little bit. Over.
Well, at least something worked on this flight.
And I just want to verify one thing, we could - -
Yes, I'm sure - -
- - Go ahead.
I say I'm sure glad we didn't have a LM impact, too.
Right. Just wanted to verify - We had poor reception when I was talking to you before - I wanted to verify that you understand that the Sun check you made earlier in the AOT was good, and that's what we're riding on. Anything that we told you in the past about looking at the Sun in the front left window or looking at stars, like Nunki through the AOT, why, we want to forget.
Roger. Understand, Vance. I think Nunki would be kind of hard to see anyway with the Moon right here.
Right.
And, Vance, we plan to start powering up at 78:12. Is that a good time or do you think we ought to hold off a little longer?
Jim, we think that's very good.
Right.
Apollo 13, Houst - Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Fred, after the burn, we'll get the powerdown instructions, or checklist changes to you. At the same time, we'd like to get a consumables status to you. All I'll say right now is that we think you look in reasonably good shape.
Okay. Very good.
Okay. Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
Okay. One CAUTION AND WARNING light here showing that you didn't call out - it's the PRE AMPS - I suppose because we don't have the ATCA breaker in yet.
Okay. That's okay.
Houston, are you planning to give us a state vector update.
That's - That's affirm, Jim. All we need is UPDATA LINK circuit breaker closed on panel 11, and P00 and ACCEPT and we can ship it up to you. P00 and DATA.
Okay, Vance. We're in DATA and P00 and the circuit breaker's in. Go ahead.
Okay. We'll ship her up to you.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, request verify RANGING FUNCTION switch is in RANGING. We need that, if it's not there now.
You got it, Vance.
Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston. The computer is yours.
Aquarius, Houston. Did you call?
We didn't call, Houston.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Houston, are you calling Aquarius?
Roger, Fred. I would like to confirm that you are getting drinking water out of, potable water out of the command module and, if you can make any estimates of how much you use as time goes on, and how much you have used, we would appreciate it for our consumables analysis.
Okay.
Okay, Jack. Tried the procedure and out of that pressure, we got 10 drinks made. That's roughly 80 ounces.
Okay, Fred, we had a little static on that one, but I think you said that 80 ounces of water has been used out of the CM. Is that right?
Yes. Jack worked the procedure and filled as many of the drinks as he could, and he made up ten bags of approximately 8 ounces a bag.
Okay. We copy that.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, just a bit of information, if for any reason you had to slip Tig|T<sub>ig</sub>, our people here feel it wouldn't do much harm if you slipped it up to 30 minutes. The procedure, of course as you know, is not to PRO on the flashing 99 and we thought you might like to be aware that Tig|T<sub>ig</sub> time isn't all that critical.
Roger. Understand.
Okay, Vance; Aquarius.
Go, Fred.
Okay. I think it's finally coming through to us here, what you said just a little while ago. Were you suggesting that we move the Tig|T<sub>ig</sub> up 30 minutes?
No, not at all. We're just giving you excess information. Just saying if you had any problem at all it could be slipped.
Oh, okay. Slipped 30 minutes. Okay. That's better.
Right.
You guys are pretty fast, though.
Yes. It kind of surprised us.
I guess that's what happens when you cut a lot out of a checklist.
Yes. Yes, we're taking about a thousand pictures in between steps there, too.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius, radio check.
Loud and clear, Fred.
Okay. I had a change in the background noises, wondered if you were still there.
Right.
Apollo 13, Houston.
Houston, Aquarius. Go ahead, Houston
Okay, Aquarius. We have some new information regarding what you should see out the commander's window at Tig|T<sub>ig</sub> Over.
Okay. Go ahead.
According to calculations - calculations, you should see the Moon. It'll be a full Moon. You should see most of the disk and it should be somewhere on your vertical LPD line, probably at about 14 on the LPD scale. Over. Roughly centered on 14.
Okay, Houston. I concur. I'm looking at 14 on the LPD and the angle is just about centered. It's south of Crisium, but its - The line is just slightly to the north of center.
Okay, Jim. That sounds very good. We see that you have a slight yaw angle, so it should be north of center.
I can even see Mount Marilyn from here.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, you are GO for the burn. GO for the burn.
Roger. I understand. GO for the burn.
Aquarius, 2 minutes and 40 seconds to go on the mark.
MARK.
Or that was - Stand by.
What was that mark?
Stand by. That was incorrect. Three minutes - Counting down to 3 minutes, and I'll give you a mark, and I'll take into consideration 2 seconds.
MARK.
Roger. We got you.
One minute.
Roger.
We're burning 40 percent.
Houston copies.
One hundred percent.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. You're looking good.
Roger.
Aquarius, you were looking good at 2 minutes. Still looking good.
Two minutes. Roger.
Aquarius, you're GO at 3 minutes.
Aquarius. Roger.
Don't forget DESCENT REG 1, off; 10 seconds to go.
SHUTDOWN.
Roger. Shut down.
Are you reading our 1640, Houston?
Roger. We're reading it.
We'll proceed. Here's our residuals.
Roger. Very small.
Good burn, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
I say, that was a good burn.
Roger. And now we want to power down as soon as possible.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
Suggest maybe you just read off the circuit breakers you want us to power down. As you did yesterday, for us.
Okay. We have a procedure ready to send up to you here in about 2 minutes. Let us know when you're all ready to take it.
Okay.
Okay. Is it going to be better to write this on a blank page, Vance, or can we use some portion of the powerdown list there in the contingency book that already exists.
Stand by 1.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Slight delay here, Jim. It will be a couple of minutes before we read that up to you, and we're looking at the contingency checklist powerdown and that's on page 5. You might be getting that out while we get all ready to give it to you.
Could you give us that page number again. Page 5 doesn't make sense.
Okay. Make that power 5 in the contingency checklist, Fred. And it's the - -
- - that's better.
- - middle part of the page, it starts emergency powerdown, and we'll mark that up.
Okay. I'm to 5 emergency powerdown.
Okay. But hold off on it because we might have to start PTC up again here. And that's the point that's being resolved right at the moment, so stand by.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We're ready to give you the procedure which will power you down a good bit, and after the PTC is going, maybe we can give you further information, are you ready to copy? Starting at the middle of the page, power 5.
Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. After number 1, first line, cross out "And VHF-A." Second line, cross out "SIMPLEX operation." Third line, cross out "Prime." That refers to PRIME POWER AMP, OFF. That - that "PRIME" should actually be replaced by OFF. And that's the second prime that line. Also in the third line the last word "OFF" should be crossed out and replaced by "PCM." Fourth line is okay. Fifth line, which is "VHF VOICE, ON, OFF, OFF," cross out. "Lighting, FLOODS," which is the next line should be "OFF", but add the following, "Or OVERHEAD/FORWARD prefer OFF." Okay. Step 2 remains the same; no change for the moment. Stand by. Skip step 2. Do not do it. Just go on to step 3, which is "Configure circuit breakers per the chart." That takes us to page power 6. Why don't you give me a readback on what you had on power 5, Fred-o.
Okay. On power 5, emergency powerdown. Item 1, first line, I scratch the "And VHF-A." Second line "SIMPLEX operation." Third line, I replace the second prime which is the POWER AMP with an "OFF," and the last word in that line is "OFF," replaced it with "PCM." Fourth line is okay. Fifth line, I scratch the whole line. Lighting, we haven't needed floods yet so we will just leave them off, exterior lighting off. Scratch line 2 and I am now on power 6, wait for your update on the CB panels.
Okay. Power 6. Okay. Power 6 refers to panel 11. You should go per the chart with the exception of those breakers that I call out. First line is okay. Or, let's say, first row. Second row, QUAD 4, TCA, closed; QUAD 3, TCA, closed; QUAD 2, TCA, closed; and QUAD 1, TCA, closed. The rest of that row is okay. Row 3, about halfway over, ATCA (PGNS), closed. Okay. The rest of that line is okay. Fourth line, HEATER - stand by. Okay. That line is all okay with the exception of the last three circuit breakers, Fred, under PGNS, which is LGC DSKY, IMU STANDBY, IMU OPERATE. Those three should be closed, at least for the time being. And finally, the fifth line; it's okay as is. And would you give me a readback on that?
Okay. I disagree on the fifth line. It appears that we ought to have the ASCENT ECA CONTROL open.
Okay. We'll check into that one and while we are listening to the rest of your readout.
Okay. And top row is correct as is. Second row we want the QUAD TCAs 1 through 4 closed. On the third row, we want the ATCA (PGNS), closed. On the fourth row we want the PGNS LGC DSKY, IMU STANDBY, IMU OPERATE, all closed, and you're saying the bottom row as is.
Okay. We'll go along with what you said on the ASCENT ECA CONTROL. That should be open.
Okay. Continue, Vance.
Okay. Next page, power 7, panel 16. First row, close the four QUAD TCA circuit breakers, that is, QUAD 1, TCA; QUAD 2, QUAD 3, and QUAD 4 TCA. Okay. Rows 2, 3, and 4 are okay.
Okay. Panel 16, top row, we want to close QUAD 1 through 4 TCA breakers, and you're saying the other three rows are as is. Again, I have the exception the ASCENT ECA CONTROL on 16 should also be open.
Okay. We concur on that, and we have a late arrival in row 3. Stand by.
Okay, Fred. One addition, third row. The S-BAND POWER AMP. Request that you pull that circuit breaker and leave the switch in PRIMARY.
Okay. Yes, that's the way we were doing it before. I'll pull the POWER AMP CB, and then I'll go back to the first stage and put the POWER AMP to PRIME.
That's correct; that should be changed back to PRIME. And that's - that's it.
Good work, Vance.
Thank you.
RESET, OFF and LOW. Okay. Lighting bus off; EXTERIOR LIGHTING is off. Okay. You want to get your breakers, Jim? We ought to probably go back to that wide deadband.
Okay. The BUS TIE INVERTERs are coming off the line.
Yes. Go ahead. Sorry, I put the switch off, that'll kill caution and warning.
Okay. Let's see. So we're going to lose the ball again.
Yes.
I'll get 16 NOUN 20 out.
Do you have me move AUTO TRANSFER this time?
Why do I still have a VHF-A receiver off?
You don't, do you?
Yes.
Let's give them a call, panel 11.
Okay, Vance. I'm on - Do you read me now, hot mike?
Roger. Loud and clear, Fred.
Okay. Jim just noticed we got a VHF breaker in on panel 11 still, I think, that probably should be opened.
Okay. That's affirmative. Pull the VHF-A receiver.
Okay. Pull it, Jim.
I got it already. Okay. Now, why are we putting the cabin fan on?
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, yes. Okay.
Okay. I'm going to pull inverter 1.
Okay. Not very long since they had the switch off on you, anyway.
Okay.
Roger. - -
- - but my only question is, I got the CROSS TIE BUS circuit breaker in? Could be - Yes, this one right here.
Good line. It's on. Because that line is open.
I'll look over at that caution in a minute.
Vance, Aquarius.
Roger. Go ahead, Fred.
Yes. We've managed the first 30 hours or so here without the caution and warning; we don't need to keep it up now, do we?
Okay, Fred. That's one that we're leaving up until the PTC is established. We have a procedure for PTC to try with you, which we're hopeful will work pretty well. And I'll read that up as soon as you get what you're doing now done.
Okay.
Why don't you go ahead, and I'll get this PTC procedure. It's by the photo log, and I'll just get that.
And one other question, Houston. You really want to pull the ASA breaker? You want to give up the AGS probably for good now, huh?
Houston, I'm standing by to copy the PTC procedures.
Okay. I'll get back with you on your question in a minute, Fred. New, here comes the PTC procedure. Step 1, GUIDANCE CONTROL to PGNS; two MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD; VERB 76, ENTER; maneuver to PTC attitude; and that incidentally is roll 0, pitch 90, and present yaw. We realize you can't monitor that on your FDAI, but you can on a verb, with a VERB 16 NOUN 20.
With me?
Roger. GUIDANCE CONTROL, PGNS; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD, VERB 76, ENTER; maneuver to PTC attitude which is roll 0, pitch 90, and yaw, which is the present yaw. Is that correct?
That's correct. Okay. Next. Mode - at - When you're established at the attitude, MODE CONTROL AUTO. Key in VERB 16 NOUN 20 to monitor rates; when less than 0.1 degree a second, rate in all - in each axis, then disable plus-X thrusters. Okay. Next VERB 25, NOUN 07, ENTER; 1257, ENTER; 252, ENTER; 1, ENTER; VERB 77, ENTER; VERB 48, ENTER; put in the DAR 22110 and PROCEED; VERB 34, ENTER; then VERB 16, NOUN 20; and monitor rates. On rates less than 0.01 degrees per second in all axis: VERB 76, ENTER; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD; then 30 clicks of right yaw to start the maneuver. Over.
Okay, Vance. PTC procedure: GUIDANCE CONTROL, PGNS; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD; VERB 76, ENTER; maneuver to PTC attitude; roll 0, pitch 90, yaw 0; my ball now, of course, is inoperative, so I'll have to get that on the DSKY. The 5 is MODE CONTROL, AUTO; 6: VERB 16, NOUN 20, monitor rates; rates less that 1 degree per second in each axis, disable, and I didn't hear that last part. The next one was VERB 25, NOUN 07, ENTER; 1257, ENTER; 252, ENTER; 1, ENTER; VERB 77, ENTER; VERB 48, ENTER; 22110, PROCEED; VERB 34, ENTER; VERB 16, NOUN 20, ENTER; monitor rates. Rates less than 0.01 degrees per second in all axis. VERB 76, ENTER; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD; then 30 clicks of right yaw to stop - to start - maneuvers
Roger. That's correct, Jim. To - to answer your questions and correct one point, yaw should be your present yaw, whatever it is, and that's up with roll 0, pitch 90, present yaw. The other thing is, you said disable and you didn't hear the rest. That's disable plus-X thrusters. And, finally, near the end, the 22110 referred to DAP loading.
Roger. Now, to maneuver to PTC roll 0, pitch 90 and yaw in - and pitch in here, roll is here. Yaw - whatever yaw we have in. Okay, Vance. In our initial maneuver to PTC attitude, I am going to have to use - to display 16 20 and I'll have to use the TTCA to get there.
Jim, Roger. Your use of the TC - TTCA and just a reminder that in maneuvering that - that - that roll is in R<sub>3</sub> and yaw is in R<sub>1</sub>.
That's affirm. And I'm going to take out roll first to get it zero and then I'm going to take care of pitch.
Okay.
Okay. GUIDANCE CONTROL, PGNS; MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD. VERB 73 clears. Okay. We've got to get that out. ...  it stopped moving.
Here we go.
... the battery. ...
Do you know what the plus-X thrusters are?
Yes, okay. I just wanted to make sure you do. I got them over here.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. A couple of things, Jim. One is that you can use the TTCA|TTCAs to maneuver, but you're going to save a lot of fuel if you'd try MINIMUM IMPULSE. So, that might be a better recommendation. The other thing is, we'd like to give you a GO before you disable the plus-X thrusters, and before you do a VERB 76, and MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD. Over.
Okay; understand. You want a GO before I - I'm - Of course, I just did a 76, and the MODE CONTROL is in ATT HOLD, at this time. But, this is later on down.
Yes. All we wanted to do was take a look at things before you disabled the plus-X thrusters, and before you go to MIN IMPULSE at the end there - that VERB 76, ENTER; MODE CONTROL, ATT HOLD.
Roger. Understand. And I'm maneuvering my roll now to zero.
Roger.
Yes. Those are the plus-X, right?
Houston, Aquarius
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Ah -
Go ahead.
In what fashion did you want us to disable those plus-X thrusters? Just pulling those appropriate TCA breakers, or did you want to actually go in and mask those jets?
Okay, Fred. We didn't explain that. The VERB 25, NOUN 07, ENTER sequence does that.
Okay. I didn't read the whole procedure. Jim just mentioned he wanted to disable plus-X.
I just did.
Okay.
And, Vance, are you still trying to get me an answer on that - pulling that ASA breaker?
That's affirm, Fred. This - The word here is, pull it.
Okay. Sure didn't get much work out of the AGS this time.
It's going slightly.
So is this one.
Yes. You got a ways to go in pitch.
Yes.
... 80.
You want to rest a little bit?
What time is it, 9:30? Yes. I got about what? I think I got about 10.
We're now in the hands of tracking.
Yes. It looks different than before.
Hard to do P37s in the LM. Hard to do a P37 in the LM.
Well, you can see where - -
You almost can see - -
- - See Ptolemaeus, Althonsus - There's Herschel.
Yes, you can barely see it in the corner there.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Just some info. We're working up a procedure for you to use to - to use command module LiOH canisters to connect to your hoses - the outlet hoses in the LM so that, as time passes in the mission, you can continue scrubbing the LM atmosphere. And this whole thing requires modifying a kit so that you can attach the hose modifying a LiOH canister, so you can attach the hose to it. So, sometime in the future, we will be coming up to you with that procedure. Second point - Second point in, we're standing by to watch your maneuver for the PTC procedure. Over.
Okay. I'm in process now, Vance, of maneuvering to zero yaw, 90-degree pitch, using MINIMUM IMPULSE.
Okay.
And, Vance, I assume it had also been brought up that we got two extra secondary cartridges - one in each PLSS.
Roger.
We ought to start working on that MOD right now.
Yes. We wish we could send you a kit and it would be kind of like putting a model airplane together or something. As it turns out, this contraption will look like a mailbox when you get it all put together.
What do we make it out of, Vance?
One canister with a - -
- - How about planning a rendezvous procedure?
- - with a plastic roof.
Just for information, Houston, during - just prior to going around the Moon, we saw a lot of debris that was floating by us, including some - one rather large piece looked like the wrapping off of a line of some sort that is - still is with us.
Roger. Copy, Jim.
Even after our free-return midcourse yesterday.
Okay. We copy that.
No matter what I do, I can't stop that. Roll either way won't do it.
Jim?
Well, I don't see any way around it, Jim. It sure doesn't seem to be doing much, does it? It won't go down.
I don't know. I wonder if they tried that in the simulator. I can't seem to get roll to go up. It goes down on me, no matter how I hit the controllers.
Got pitch zero.
You can really see a change in rate?
... jar here, see if it'll couple in roll.
No?
There we go.
That does it.
I'm glad, too.
I don't know what caused it.
Here we still have 67-percent fuel level. I wonder how come they didn't ... DELTA-V curve?
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, we don't have any data on your movements right now. How does it look like this procedure's going to work out so far as getting an attitude set up, the first part of the procedure?
Well, Vance, I've been trying to use MINIMUM IMPULSE only attitude control to get my roll and yaw - the roll and pitch, rather. But, with the attitude control only in this configuration, I - I can't command these - the roll the way I want to. So, I had to go to TTCA to get my roll to build up towards zero, it was going - decreasing towards 270. I really don't know what the combination is in the attitude control, that you can get the control to pitch and roll the way you want it to. You've got to use the TTCA.
Roger. Copy.
I now have both pitch and yaw - or pitch and roll going toward the designated amounts, now passing through 23 degrees in pitch, and I'm going up past 321 degrees in roll. And I am letting go that direction and when I get there, 90 in pitch and zero in roll, I'll go to AUTO and damp the rates.
Get a little sleep? That's okay.
We've got to rig up a method of using those lithium hydroxide canisters.
Okay, Houston. We just got a MASTER ALARM and an ECS light. I take it the partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub> is - Yes - That's what tripped it.
There's that mother.
Aquarius, Houston. Say again.
All right. CO<sub>2</sub>. Our CO<sub>2</sub> value is getting high. We had a DPS ECS light and a blinking component light.
Okay. Copy.
Stand by on that PTC O<sub>2</sub>.
Say again, Houston.
Hello, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Okay. Read you loud and clear now, Jim.
Okay. Did you hear what I just said about the ECS light and the blinking CO<sub>2</sub> component light?
Okay. We got that and - Stand by 1.
Okay.
Not much.
Jack, we might have to have you rig up this CO<sub>2</sub> rig they're talking about.
Go ahead. Houston. Over.
Oh! We've got a long ways to go.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. We're going to have to get back with you in a couple of minutes on whether or not we switch over at this time to your other canister. Second point, it might help in setting up this PTC if you concentrate on roll first, and get that going; and then work on pitch, when roll is established, and sort of take whatever yaw you get.
Okay. Vance, I tried that but when I start doing roll only I get pitch coupled in with it. But both of them rolling up toward this desired amount, though. I'm up to 46 and in pitch and 326 in roll.
Okay. Understand you've tried it.
Once I get roll zeroed, I don't think it'll be too bad.
(Laughter)
So what did they put on my LEVA?
Oh, boy.
...?
No. He didn't want it. There she goes, gang. The Moon.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay, Jim. Since the first recommendation on how to maneuver PTC didn't work out, we have another one. And you might try this. Put yaw at zero, then start the roll, and the pitch after that.
Vance, do you read?
Yes. I do now. Go ahead.
Okay. You guys just tell me what sort of material you had in mind to build this mailbox out of, and Jack and I will go to work on trying to construct that thing. Assume we'll use the space-age baling wire or the gray tape?
That's affirm. We have a lengthy procedure here; but, in short, you use plastic as a covering for the whole thing. You put some kind of a stiffener at the top so the plastic doesn't suck against the LOI - LiOH enter - entrance side. You'll - You need gray tape to stick the whole thing together, and you need something like a sock to put in the - the bottom so that the outlet side is plugged up. As it turns out, the flow is rather U-shaped through the cartridge, Fred. It, if you plug up the bottom, it comes in one side of the top and goes out the other.
Okay. (Sigh) Hold on a minute. Let - Let us go get a cartridge and with it in hand, I'll speak to you some more.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Okay, Vance. Go ahead.
Okay. Really, I think we should give you a more detailed procedure on that; and, in general, those are the materials that are to be used, but let us get back with a detailed procedure on how to make this cartridge arrangement work.
Okay.
And to answer your question about PTC, Vance, it's rather difficult to use yaw in zero right away. So what I'm doing, yaw is working toward zero right now. Pitch is working toward 90, and roll is working toward - zero. So, we - We're just going to take some time to get there, that's all.
Roger. Quite a bit of noise now. I understand you're still having a problem getting there with the PTC.
We are getting there slowly.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Let's try FORWARD OMNI.
I don't know, it looks ...
I don't know, it looks that way.
Okay, Houston. How do you read, now?
Houston, how do you read?
Loud and clear, now. Go ahead.
Okay. I switched to FORWARD OMNI, now.
Roger. ...
Okay.
They're ... off. They can't stop pitch.
...
That would only use fuel.
... and stick it around that way.
Must have the wrong thing, there.
Oh, yes. That was pretty.
That didn't sound very good.
Yes, hang on to that.
...
They're a hell of a long ways away.
Right.
Yes, we're not moving that fast to Earth.
Not yet.
Hey, we're already ... this time, huh?
Yes.
... to the trajectory.
Huh?
...
Yes, I've been trying to get roll out. Roll to zero. Just go ahead to zero, I'm going to put it in ATT HOLD. Then it'll take out yaw, leaving pitch the way it is; then we're going to pitch down.
We've got to think about when we have to start changing that canister.
Fifteen even.
Huh?
... to 15.
What is it right now?
Nothing. We're not reading anything.
Well, that's the one they wanted you to leave in.
...
It's in. That's how it triggers the - Okay, Jack. I'm going to push in on this thing to stop it.
Yes.
That just turned the MASTER ALARM back on. Now that it's on steady, I'll leave it on. I can't understand why I got a power - Oh, I know. That's right. ... That reading is correct.
Yaw. I'm going the wrong way though, aren't I?
(Laughter).
Okay. What we're going to do, Jack, ... over there ...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, it looks pretty good except that the pitch is going out in the wrong direction, now. Over.
I concur. What I'm going to do is get roll to zero and I'm trying to bring yaw into zero and as soon as I get those two pretty well matched up, then I'm going to take the pitch and try to pitch it down.
Okeydoke.
Okay. Now I've got pitch going down; I've got roll almost zero and yaw is almost zero.
Okay. Copy, there, Jim.
Houston, what's an acceptable pitch attitude, that you'll take?
Aquarius, Houston.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Roger. What's the acceptable pitch attitude that we can have for PTC? I can go into AUTO any time now, I'm looking at 118 degrees in pitch, practically zero roll, and about 40 degrees of yaw.
Ninety degrees of pitch.
I'm looking at 118 degrees of pitch.
Stand by.
I'm trying to talk to them.
Stand by a minute, Jim. The pitch is the important thing, but - but stand by 1.
Okay. It's coming down. What's that? Well, I guess I'd better eat something. Hey, this one has some of that candied jelly ... you know, we've gone a hell of a long time without any sleep. I said we've gone a hell of a long time without any sleep.
We'll have to start thinking about getting the ... back to sleep again because - I know - I - I didn't get hardly any sleep last night at all.
Hey, Fred? These jettison bags with the - are real airtight stuff, if you want to use them for wrapping for a lithium hydroxide bag or something like that.
Yes, this stuff is really tight.
Yes.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. Would you stable your - stabilize your rates here at the attitudes you're at now and go ATT HOLD. Over.
Okay. Will do. I'm now at 103 degrees - 106 degrees pitch, and 2.5 degrees roll.
Roger.
...?
No.
... mine are ... Hey, I got you a clean one.
Okay.
Last one's in the trash bag. Oh, I thought - if you wanted a ..., you'll have to use the lithium hydroxide ...
Okay, Houston. Are you monitoring my angles? It appears that it might be less then 1 degree per second.
Stand by. We'll check them, Jim.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, that's affirm. We're monitoring and you're almost there, but we'd like to let them stabilize a little bit longer. Over.
Okay. We'll - We'll just hold.
And if - if you can now go into your eat period or do something else while the rates are stabilizing, why, we recommend you relax somewhere and get some chow.
Right-o. We'll do that.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. Looks like your rates are damped sufficient. Recommend that you go ahead with the VERB 25, NOUN 07, ENTER bit on down through the VERB 34, ENTER, and then wish you'd stand by for us to look at it again before you go beyond that. Over.
Okay, Houston. I'll go through VERB 25, NOUN 07, down through VERB 34 ENTER, and I'll stand by.
Right-o.
Okay, Houston. That's complete.
Roger. Houston copies, and we'll - -
You ... monitor our rates?
Roger.
We - -
You want to monitor the rates; we're 16 20.
Roger. That's the way it should be done, and we're standing by for the rates to dump out some more.
Okay.
How you coming?
Oh, we're taking stock of how much we got there, maybe sort of think about rationing some of it. I mean just to make sure we've got enough to last us and that we get enough water out. I'd hate to run out of water on the last day. Take a look and see how much we got, and fill them up and just hold them there. Yes, and I'll tell you the stuff that's good to eat now will be the candies, the sandwich spreads. Maybe the freeze - the dehydrated stuff. If you have to rehydrate it, it'd be kind of difficult. No, wet packs are good.
As a matter of fact, we might use those little - Well, how about the PLSSs?
Yes, I know, but I mean the PLSSs are bombs, too.
...
We're damping rates.
...
Well, maybe we ought to use the OPS first.
You guys moving around?
Okay.
Apollo 13, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Vance.
Jim, just a reminder. Any waste water dumped at this point would really jiggle up the PTC preparation, so request you save that until we're spun up. Over.
Right. I don't think we're doing any.
No. No, I don't think so, but I just wanted to make sure you were aware of it - I thought you were.
We're saving all the water we can.
... for a minute?
With the new space. ... we're ... We've just about slowed down. You're damping right.
There she is.
And, Houston, Aquarius.
Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Vance. A couple of items we uncovered for that cartridge MOD. One is the special dust covering bag that we were going to use on the tote bags, that is pretty thick and nonporous; and we went up to the upstairs kitchen and drained water a couple of more times, and made up a whole bunch of drink bags, again; and from the pantry, we retrieved a fairly large - enclosed - enclosure made of plastic that those drink bags are in that I think we can scissor and also make do for a cover, taping it on, if that's appropriate.
Okay. Jack Lousma here has a refined version of the procedure on how to make these the easy way, and I think before too long he ought to be reading that up to you. If - -
Okay.
It's not time critical to get this up to you. It's just that, before you get too far in assembling these on your own, we'd kind of like to give you the benefit of experience down here.
Okay. Who - Who built them back there.
Tony did some of it, and Jack's been working on it, too. So we've had a big effort on it.
Great.
We would encourage you to wait until tomorrow to receive that procedure, but we can send it up sooner, if you insist. Over.
No, that's all right, Vance. Before we have to worry about that I guess we got another primary and three secondaries to go through.
That's right.
You know, sometimes those cartridges have - I guess they rejuvenate.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Man, that's a wicked low pressure down there. I wish I was on it. (Laughter).
Aquarius, Houston.
... up ...
Okay, Jim. Your rates are once again looking good so we can continue on with the rest of this procedure. Request you go ahead with the VERB 76 ENTER, and MODE CONTROL, to ATT HOLD, and then the last step, 30 clicks yaw right.
Jets are firing again.
Okay. I'll do a VERB 76 ENTER with the MODE CONTROL ATT HOLD and then 30 clicks of right yaw to set the maneuver.
VERB 76 ENTER.
Roger.
There's your VERB 76, ENTER. MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD. Now you want me to do 30 clicks of right yaw?
Vance, did you say for me to hold on the right yaw or do you want me to start it now?
No, no need to hesitate, you can start now.
Okay.
After you get that going, then we'll think about powering down the PGNS.
Okay. There were 30 clicks of right yaw.
Okay. We'd like to look at it for just a little while before we power down the PGNS, so stand by.
Understand you're planning to power down the FGNS?
Right. We want to get the amps down.
Okay.
... finish ...
That's bad news.
Take 26 pictures of you?
Why not?
You want to bring all the film back empty?
I'd like to just ... and shoot it.
Well, that means I've got to -
Hey, let me see if I can get this started here.
Okay.
Hey, Jim.
Yes, we'll probably get there ..
Aquarius, Houston. Request AFT OMNI.
You got it, Vance?
Roger. That did it. Thank you.
Gad, there's Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus.
Yes, sure enough.
See them right over the edge.
Here, let me shoot a few pictures of the old Moon here.
Yes. (cough) Which ones .. Did you put it back?
Yes.
Looks like we got ... to do with Earth? Ptolemaeus?
We need it to aline again.
You don't think that burn was enough, do you?
Was that a midcourse? The RCS is worse.
The RCS ... attitude.
... ought to come up the side. Then, you got us in the right plane, Jim. We're in the right plane. We're pointed off and we'll swerve on again with the Earth, Moon, and Sun.
In another respect, it might be easier to get a -
Look in the rear detent now. Go to -
How's that?
Awful.
Oh, that's right. That blasted service - command module is back there. Scratch that one. That one?
It's not much better. Okay, let's go this one.
Keep the ...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Jim, we have some status information for you, if you're ready to copy on a piece of scratch paper.
Stand by, Vance.
Okay.
We're ready for you.
Put that away and get some status paper here.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. First, midcourse correction will probably be at GET 104 hours, and all we look for is a 4- to 6-feet-per-second DELTA-V. Okay. That's the first item. Now, I will give you a rundown on consumables. Okay. In the LM, you have 1498 - that is 1 4 9 8 amp-hours remaining. That means over 61 hours you'd - That would average out to 24.5 amps. We expect that, after powerdown, that you will use 1 4 or 14 amps per hour, and that would leave a reserve of 500 amp-hours at the end of the mission. Are you with me?
Roger. We're with you.
I saved my - number was yesterday.
Okay. In the LM, you have - -
We're with you.
Roger. In the LM, you have 215, that is 2 1 5, pounds of water, usable. That would average out over 61 hours to 3.5 pounds per hour available. Okay.
Okay. And after you power down, we expect that you will be using water at the rate of 3.2 to 2.7 pounds - That's at 14 amps per hour electrical usage rate. One note, this does not - When we speak here of water available, this does not include CSM water and PLSS water, so that's add on. Okay, next, LiOH. Using the CSM cans, you will have 16 cans at 12 hours per can to give you 1 9 2, or 192 hours, of LiOH. And, in the LM, using its cans, you have 44 hours remaining.
Vance, is that with the PLSS secondaries?
That's affirm. That's affirm. That includes PLSS secondaries.
Okay; oxygen. You have remaining 44 pounds in the LM. At a usage rate of 0.36 pounds per hour, that leaves you 120, or 1 2 0, hours of oxygen. Okay. Next, RCS. RCS A stands at 6 2 percent and B at 6 2 percent. We only expect 2 percent to be used for the PTC, so you're in good shape for RCS. Next, DPS DELTA-V. You have 1190 feet per second remaining. And, finally, CSM EPS. We estimate that you have 99 amp-hours. That's an estimate. And that's it. Over.
Okay. I copy.
Okay. And just a question. It would be interesting to hear from Jack to see if he thinks that main B bus is good. If he has any idea of how, if whether it's good or not, this would influence our steps in the future; for example, we might want to try to test main B to see if it is, in fact, good so that we'd know how to set switches for entry.
Roger. Just a minute. They want to know whether you think main bus B is any good for the command module.
Vance, while Jack's got on the loop, let me pose the question of how we're planning on doing this midcourse, if we are going to power down the PGNS.
Would you stand by on that, Jim? We'd like to give you a procedure for that later on.
Okay. Got a midcourse at 104 hours, he's going to give us a procedure for that later on.
In short, Jim, we don't expect any problem, but we'll explain further later on.
Okay.
Deke says get a night's sleep. He says you've been working hard, and you ought to relax a little bit and be ready for tomorrow.
Vance, this is Jack.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. Let me give you my observations on main bus B. Things happened pretty fast there, and we first heard the impact or explosion or whatever caused it, I'm not sure. The next - About 1 second later, there was a MASTER ALARM which was the MAIN BUS B UNDERVOLT. I looked at the voltage, and the voltage was good at this time so I'm suspecting it was a spike. Fuel cell 3 was also good, with good flow. However, Fred, at that point, was coming into the command module and got over into his seat. At that time, we shortly had an AC BUS 2 light about the time he got into his seat. He looked at the MAIN BUS B and the MAIN BUS B was reading ZERO. It, however, - and the fuel cell flows were ZERO. I'm kind of suspecting that perhaps we do have a MAIN - a current MAIN BUS B. But that's merely a guess. I never did try to reset it. We were having other problems with the MAIN BUS A, having an UNDERVOLT and a few other things like that. I'd kind of like to hear what your feelings are down there.
Well, Jack, we copy your information. And we'd like to hold off because we're still working the problem. So we'll have to give you information later.
Thank you.
Aquarius, request AFT OMNI.
Vance, are you back with me?
Roger. We're with you.
Okay. We lost lock there. We switched OMNIs. Just for my own - kind of to get my thoughts in order, I'd kind of hear what - I'd like to hear what kind of entry you're planning. EMS or PGNS or what ?
Okay. PGNS entry is being planned, and people are at work on checklist changes and that sort of thing.
Okay. Real fine.
And - we'll - We'll give you the CSM stuff tomorrow, but basically we expect that main bus B is good and we're going to work up a procedure to test it.
Okay. Those are my thoughts, too.
But - -
You think main bus B is good, don't you?
That's affirm.. We think it is, but we want to check it out anyway. We think you guys are in great shape all the way around. Why don't you quit worrying, and go to sleep.
Oh, that - That's our boss, Deke.
Well, I think we just might do that - or part of us will.
I mixed up. How many more of those - Are we hot mike? - -
Yes.
Yes, I'm mixed up. You had 15? I mixed up seven more. So we got 22. By the way, there's still some water that's- it's not enough pressure to mix up another drink, but there is some water out of there, if you want to get some water out of the drink cup.
That's good; I could use some.
We ought to use that oxygen up and not waste it. (Cough)
You monitoring right now?
Yes. Just stand by.
What'll it take to ...
Yes.
You only got two ... there, so ...
I will.
You wouldn't believe it, but I'm now in command of the LM. Okay. Vance, I'm probably the only CMP that's ever witnessed a DPS burn sitting on the ascent engine head.
Did you get some? Is there any coming out still? They didn't answer. I think we made it. How's this working out?
Okay. No problem.
They are, huh? How are we going to get an alinement?
We'll pull one out someways, I guess. We've gotta watch that one right there.
It's decreasing now. It'll - it'll - It's cold. I noticed that in the command module. It'll wobble.
Houston, Aquarius.
Switch OMNIs to TRANSMIT.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Roger. Are you planned to set up here very shortly - a powerdown procedure?
That's affirmative, if you'll take out your contingency book and turn to page Power 6. Over.
Roger. Stand by. Contingency Power 6. Get the book over here. Contingency Power 6.
Well, I hope this ...
And while you're doing that, let's put ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, switches to MODE CONTROL.
All three ATTITUDE CONTROL switches have been in MODE CONTROL.
Okay. And when you get to Power 6, you ought to see a circuit breaker page, panel 11.
Have a pencil? Let's see it - thank you.
Okay. I have Power 6, panel 11.
Okay. On Power 6, panel 11 - The top three rows, configure them as you see them.
Okay, now, Jack ... We have put the TCAs in for the previous procedure. Do you want those out, now?
That's affirmative, Jim, Pull them out. TCAs open.
Okay. I'm changing those to ... back again. First three rows. And you're pulling the ATCA PGNS, huh?
That's affirmative. Pull ATCA PGNS open.
Okay. I've done that.
Okay. Are you ready for the fourth row?
Affirm.
Okay. Now when we get in the fourth row, we're going to open the IMU OPERATE circuit breaker; and what that means is that we're going to lose the capability to watch your CDUs, so we're not going to be able to see your attitude. Therefore, we will not be able to advise you on which antenna to select for communications. The way we want you to handle that is to turn the LM UPLINK SQUELCH off, and when you hear the noise, switch antennas. We'll be able to see you switch antennas, and it's going to take us about 3 to 5 minutes to establish a lockon again after you switch. After each time that you switch antennas, we will initiate a voice check. And basically when you see the Earth out the window, you can be on FORWARD antenna, and when the Moon's up in the window use the AFT antenna. You copy?
Okay. We're going to pull the IMU OPERATE circuit breaker, so you won't be able to see our attitude. Therefore, you won't tell us how to switch antennas and we'll enable the - I will turn the - up the SQUELCH OFF so that when we start getting any static, we'll switch antennas and as a thumb rule we could use - with the Earth forward, we use the FORWARD antenna and when we see the Moon we use the AFT antenna.
That's affirmative, Jim. In other words, we're leaving the antenna switching up to you, and after you switch antennas it's going to take 3 to 5 minutes for us to establish a lockon again, and we'll initiate a voice check. And I'm ready to go on panel 11, row 4.
Okay.
Okay. On row 14, under HEATERS RCS SYSTEM A/B-1: open QUAD 1 through 4; under ECS, the only change is - under GLYCOL PUMP close AUTO TRANSFER; under COMM, the only change is: open VHF A RECEIVER, open COMMANDER AUDIO; under PGNS, the only change is: close and leave closed IMU STANDBY circuit breaker, so we can have heaters. Read back.
Okay. On row 4, we're going to open all four of the heaters - the RCS SYSTEM A and B - the first four circuit breakers. We're going to close the AUTO TRANSFER. We're going to open the VHF A RECEIVER and the COMMANDER AUDIO. And we're going to close the IMU STANDBY. The LGC DSKY and the IMU OPERATE will be open.
That's affirmative, Jim. All other breakers in that row are as you see them in the checklist. And on row 5, the only change is that we want you to, under EPS, open ASCENT ECA CONTROL. Over.
Roger. I think we already have that opened - ASCENT ECA CONTROL is probably already open.
Okay. So let me confirm. We'll have one COMM system, that will be the LMP system, and we'll have to do our own antenna switching; therefore, we'll have to wait about - Okay, why don't you switch? Aft antenna.
We'll have to wait for you to get a lockon again. Is that correct?
That's affirmative, Jim. You'll be working off of the LMP's panel over there.
Okay. What else do you have for me?
Okay. Panel 16, that's on page Power-7. Top row, the only change is: under RCS SYSTEM B, open PQGS/DISPLAYS. Over.
Okay. I may go over this with you, Jack, because this checklist has been written over two or three times now on our various procedures. Top row, the first two are open, the next three are closed, and we're going to open now the QUAD TCA's 1, 2, 3, 4; CROSSFEED will be closed, and the TEMP/PRESS DISPLAYFLAG will be opened, and we're going to open up the PQCS, MAIN SOV will be closed, and the ... will be opened.
That's affirmative, Jim. And there's no change to the second row. Over.
Okay. Again let me go through this with you. The first four are going to be closed. The next sev - eight will be - the next nine will be open from LOGIC POWER B through DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE How about the CWEA? Is that going to be closed?
That's affirmative, Jim. We want the next five closed.
Okay.
Okay. In the third row, under COMM: DISPLAY, open; SE AUDIO, closed; VHF A TRANSMITTER, open - That's a change - VHF B RECEIVER, open; PRIMARY S-BAND, POWER AMPLIFIER, open; TRANSMITTER/RECEIVER, closed; S-BAND ANTENNA, open; PMP, closed; TV, open. Under ECS: DISPLAYS, open; GLYCOL PUMP SECONDARY, open; LOC PUMP, open; CABIN FAN CONTROL, open; CABIN REPRESS, closed; and all the next four closed also. Read back.
Okay. We have DISPLAY, open; SE AUDIO, closed; VHF A TRANSMITTER, open; VHF B RECEIVER, open; POWER AMP's going to be open; TRANSMITTER/ RECEIVER, closed; S-BAND ANTENNA, open; PMP, closed; TV, open; DISPLAY is open; next three are open; CABIN REPRESS, closed; and all the rest closed.
That's affirmative, Jim. And in row 4, under HEATERS, we want them all - Correction - we want all the QUAD HEATERS open. Correction - we want all the QUAD HEATERS closed.
All the - -
We want DISPLAY, open; S-BAND ANTENNA, closed - to avoid a MASTER ALARM, CAMERA - SEQUENCE CAMERA, open; And under EPS, we want DISPLAYs, open; DC BUS VOLT, closed; INVERTER 2, open; ASCENT ECA, closed; ASCENT ECA CONTROL, open; DESCENT ECA, closed; DESCENT ECA CONTROL, closed; TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, close; we want the CROSS TIE BUS, open; the BAL LOADS, closed; BAT FEED TIEs, closed. How do you read?
Okay. The four RCS HEATERS will be closed; DISPLAYS, open; S-BAND ANTENNA, closed; CAMERA SEQUENCE will be open; DISPLAY will be open; DC BUS VOLT will be closed; INVERTER 2 open; ASCENT ECA will he closed, but the ASCENT ECA CONTROL, open; DESCENT ECA, closed; DESCENT ECA CONTROL, closed; TRANSLUNAR BUS TIE, closed; and CROSS TIE BUS, open; and BALANCE LOADS, closed; and the BAT FEED TIEs, closed. I have one question, Jack. On panel - on the second line there under LIGHTING, why are we keeping: the FLOODS and TRACK closed? Or are they going to be open?
Negative. We have the, LIGHTING breakers all closed. Control the lighting with the switches and rheostats. Over.
Okay. We don't need the floodlights, I don't think, but we can do it that way, I guess.
And under row 4, under RCS SYSTEMS A/B-2, QUAD HEATERS, you notice that we've closed those circuit breakers, but what we want you to do is to - on panel 3, turn the RCS A/B-2 QUAD switches 1, 2, 3, and 4, off. Over.
And we're going to watch your quad temps for you, and when we need to warm them up a little bit, we'll tell you to throw those four switches on - on panel 3.
Okay. Now are we sure that this PTC mode is good enough so we don't ... get crossed up later and get out of configuration.
Stand by 1 on that, Jim. Okay, Jim, as far as we can tell right now, the PTC looks as good as any PTC we've ever seen in a CSM, so we're going to go with what we've got.
Okay.
Okay, and if you turn over the page on Power 8, we have the spacecraft functions remaining to you. We've got low bit rate TM. However, we don't have any VHF. We have CWEA. We have GLYCOL PUMPS. We have SUIT FANS. We have CABIN REPRESS for you, and stand by in ATTITUDE CONTROL here. Okay, in ATTITUDE CONTROL, we'll have hardovers for uses in emergency, and for normal usage we want to have a 15-minute delay to get the heaters on to warm them up be before use. How do you read?
Okay. For emergency, we have the hardovers and for normal use it requires a 15-minute request to get the heaters on.
That's affirmative.
Okay, Jim, that concludes our powerdown procedure, and we're waiting for you to get with it.
Okay, Jack, we'll start. I sure hate to lose the PGNS. I sure hope that procedure for the midcourse is a good one.
It is.
You want me to help you here?
Yes, you can - Okay. First we power down, panel 11. All of them open.
Closed.
Yes.
Stand by for a MASTER ALARM. ...
Okay.
Here it comes.
LTG. You just did it.
I'll give you this when I'm finished. After we go through this, then you can go through it again and doublecheck it.
Right.
Now, the flood lights are on, right? No, I kind of don't think we need them though, do you?
Don't pull those. Give me the - first of all. We'll get back there. Those four are close, open, open, ENGINE ARM, open, ...
Say, Houston; Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
It will take him a minute to ...
You're familiar with our particular spacecraft that on panel 16 HEATERS RCS SYSTEMS A and B, QUAD 1 HEATER circuit breaker has been pushed in, and sealed in, and if it's ever pushed out, it's doubtful if we'll ever be able to reset it.
Okay, Jim, on the four QUAD HEATER breakers, we want you to leave them closed. And we'll operate the heaters with the switches on panel 3. Over.
Okay.
No.
Okay. We'll do it right there.
Okay. And I'm closing the HEATERS on panel 4, QUAD 1 through 4, OFF.
Okay. It's time for you guys to get to bed and get Fred up.
(Laughter) I still have one question, Jack. I still think that - I still say that the - on the LIGHTING in our panel 16, the FLOOD lights and the TRACK should be open. We're not using them.
Do you have any argument about -
No problem, Jim. Go ahead and open them, TRACK and FLOOD, that's all right.
Okay, TRACK and FLOOD are OPEN.
Now, why don't you go through that, Jack, and make sure those - -
Yes.
- -
Okay, I'll take this.
Okay, Jack, my only other concern now is the CO<sub>2</sub> rise in the spacecraft. I guess you're keeping a handle on that?
That's affirmed, Jim. We have you up to 10.6 now, and we're willing to go a little higher on that. We have another cartridge and we have a procedure for making the command module cartridges up. We'll pass that on later.
Oh, yes. I'm not worried about that. I just wanted to make sure that you - -
Are they going to - -
- - that - We just don't want to go to sleep here and forget about the rise in CO<sub>2</sub>.
Are they going to use ... - -
Roger. We're watching it for you - -
Yes, they're getting it ...
- - We have it here. It's now 10.7 and we have a medical go to 15 millimeters.
That's a new one.
There's a new first for you.
Okay, Jim, we estimate we've got 1 more hour on the primary cartridge, and 6 or 7 hours on the secondary.
Okay. Fine. Say, it's a spare primary cartridge back there, too, isn't it? So that's good for another, how long?
Yes. Yes. That's yours though, isn't it?
And you're right, Jim. We've got another primary cartridge back there behind the ascent engine cover.
Right, yes. We know. Thank you.
Yes, yes, I just -
Okay. I guess you've done everything right on that panel. Let me check the middle one. Yes. You powered down and then you leave me. Tell me, I've got it.
Okay, Jack, we just thought it's about time you got a LM checkout.
But he's giving it to me inert. Of course, I'm giving him my command module, too, which is rather inert right now, too.
Well, you've got to walk before you run, you know.
Aquarius, Houston.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Jack.
Roger. For your information, Jack - -
You're loud and clear.
- - all of our analysis is based on powerdown to 14 amps, but we're reading on you right now 12.3 and so we're better off than we were in our analysis.
That sounds good.
Jack, I thought you were going to get the sleep shift where there wasn't any excitement?
Well, I tried, but I didn't make it. I thought you were supposed to he sleeping now.
Well, Fred-o is getting something to eat, and Jim is starting to sack out so I'm taking the COMM here until Fred gets set.
Okay.
As I just - Yes, are you ready to take over? Well, he just - he just asked - said he thought I was supposed to be sleeping. And I told him that I was waiting for you to - Okay. You were off the NET when they explained the - But don't they - Can't we monitor our CDU's any more to tell when to switch antennas, so they've just - When they can see it switch - it will take a couple of minutes for them to get up. And they'll always make a voice check with you.
It came out here. I caught it. Okay. Now, are you getting squared, I'll give you the COMM here.
I don't know. [...]
They're, they're showing right now 12.3 amps Their analysis is based on 14 so they're in better - Okay. Headset's yours
Okay, Jack. How do you read?
Hearing you loud and clear, Fred. OMNI.
Okay.
Okay, I heard the - -
I see you luck out with all the good shifts.
Yes, I got all the good deals. I heard Jack brief you on the COMM mode so, you got any questions about that?
Okay.
And how is your PTC going? I heard Jack tell you that we can't see your CDU's. How's it going?
Well, let's see, we may be offsetting slightly, the Sun looks like it may be a little higher now. Here comes the Earth by and it looks about the same perspective. I'll have to wait to see the Moon on the other side, Jack. ...
Okay, Fred, I can't hear you any more on account of the background noise. I assume that - I think I heard Jack tell you what we're going to do about COMM. UPLINK SQUELCH, off. You'll take care of the antennas because we can't see your attitude. We'll give you a voice check when come up. It'll take us 3 to 5 minutes to come up. And to make it astronaut-proof, when you see the Earth, use a forward antenna; when you see the Moon, use the aft one.
Yes, that's pretty straightforward. Okay, I see the Earth so I've very wisely shifted to FORWARD.
Good boy.
Got another battery?
... really sick.
Earth will be by over there in a minute.
And, Jack, you still up?
Still here, Fred.
Okay, when I was upstairs, just a minute ago, I noticed what appeared to be some new venting from down the service module way. I noticed that out window 1, and also saw one chunk of metal - loose metal about 4 inches square that was tumbling around - silver in color, and it, looked like it had come from somewhere down in the service module.
Okay. You saw some venting out window 1 - -
And I -
Go ahead.
Yes, that's where I happened to be looking. The lighting was such that it showed up out there. What reminded me of it was I'm looking out the LM window now and I sea a good part of the new star field it's created for us. There are about a thousand little sparklies out here.
Okay, so you're seeing some venting out window 1, and you saw a 4-inch-square piece of loose metal which was silver, and - Are you still seeing the venting or has it zeroed out now?
I don't know. I left upstairs, I'm down in the LM now, Jack. I guess when Jack goes up he can take a look and let me know. Okay, I'll think about switching aft here directly. I see the Moon, and the Moon looks pretty good, Jack, so I guess our PTC still doing pretty good.
Okay, and we won't have any COMM delay if the PTC stays good.
Yes, sure enough the Moon is getting smaller.
Good, and we want to ask you another question about the venting. Is this - would you suppose - some new venting or is this venting that you just hadn't - that's been going on all the time, but which you hadn't looked at recently?
I can't really say, Jack, we've been so tied up down in the LM, I guess we kind of forgot about the other half. But I've been upstairs several times and hadn't particularly noticed any flow by the windows before, so I - my first assumption was that it was some new venting. It really wasn't very heavy.
Okay. Copy. Thank you.
And Jack's going up to take a look now.
Okay. And for your information, all of our numbers are based on amperage usage of 14 amps. And we're using only 12.3, so we're a little fat on our analysis.
Very good. Way to be.
And we're in a - -
I'll tell you, this Aquarius has really been a winner.
Well, that's one of several. And we want to tell you something that I told Jim earlier, and that concerns control. Right now you have control in hardover if you need it, but when we go to some normal control modes, since we have the quad heaters off. We want to have a 15-minute notice for attitude control request. Over.
Okay, Jack. Offhand, I can't imagine that since we got the platform powered down why we'd need to worry about the instantaneous control. But at any rate, we need 15-minutes warmup with the heaters before we can start using thrusters.
Right. And another thing we've done is to pull your ECS and EPC DISPLAY breakers and so - But we left your CAUTION and WARNING powered up. So if you get ECS-type or EPS CAUTION and WARNING you'll have to power up those meters with the DISPLAY breakers. And we are watching for you your PIPA temperatures, your ASA TEMP, your propellant temperatures except for the DPS propellant, and we're watching your quad temps for you.
Okay. That's very good, Jack. You're watching them. That's good enough.
And everybody's fine at home El Lago.
Great.
And, Fred, your CO<sub>2</sub> is building up. It's at 11 on our gage, and we've got a medical buildup to 15 millimeters, at which time we'll switch over to secondary. Looks like we've got plenty of lithium hydroxide, about 192 hours including the CSM cartridges. And as you know, we've got a way to use those. And as soon as we get them written in some good words, why, we'll pass; that along. You might be able to make one.
Okay. Yes, we'll sure give her a try. And I'm showing onboard about 12-1/2 millimeters of mercury.
Roger. And I have a flight plan update when you get a time to copy it sometime, I'll pass it along. There's no hurry on it.
Okay. Stand by 1. Jack's back now.
Okay. Jack just came hack and he said it's still coming out; it's only coming out on the commander's side. So he saw it out the same window I did, window 1. And it's between the minus Y and minus Z axis.
Okay. And of course - -
Jack says it's definitely the service module which was - which was my impression, too.
Okay. So you're sure it's the service module, and, of course, the thing we're interested in knowing, is it something that is residual from before, or is it something new. And if you have any ideas about that, why we'd sure like to have them them.
Yes. Yes, Jack, I'll answer him your question in a minute, but make Jack's first impression here, is that it's not near the intensity that it was right after our mishap. And I'll have to agree with that. I'd say - he said it was a half and I said it was maybe down to a third. And Houston would like to know if you have any impressions as to whether it is still a residual from that or maybe something new.
I don't know why after I felt that. Yes, I felt it was some new something - new venting, too.
Okay. Switch to FORWARD OMNI.
Fred-o, if you think it's practical, we're ready to give you some - we're working on some camera settings for pictures of the venting. And, if you have a camera out and ready to go, let us know which one it is so we can get the settings for that camera. What do you think about that?
Okay. Jack's got the one with the 250-millimeter lens on it. That's the standard EL. And I have a surface camera out that I've been shooting hundreds of Earth/Moon pictures with, camera 1. And we also have the Reseau upstairs that's pretty handy. The command module DC camera. So you can about - -
Okay. I copy that - -
- - take your choice, because - -
I copy the 250 millimeter, the Reseau is available, but I didn't get what other one is.
Okay. I got my Hasselblad surface camera down in the LM here handy, too, camera 1.
And, Jack, if we're going to do any picture taking out the command module windows, I think we'd better do that pretty quick, or hold up until Jim and Jack get their rest done.
We concur with that.
Okay, Fred, we're not going to bother the skipper up there. We won't be taking any pictures out of the command module window until after rest period.
Okay.
Shifting to FORWARD OMNI.
Okay. Fred, for your information, your CO<sub>2</sub> reading onboard is a little higher than what we're reading here on the ground, and so when it gets to 15 on your meter, switch to secondary. And we'd like to get a status about every 30 minutes - we'll give you a call on that. But just to let us know we're still thinking about you, we'd like you to go BIOMED RIGHT, please.
Okay, Going BIOMED RIGHT.
Hey, how do you read me on this COMM mode on S-band?
5 square, Fred. How me?
We're still here, Fred. How's it going?
Okay. My CO<sub>2</sub> reading is now just below 13.
Say again what it is.
It's just - just below 13.
Okay. Just below 13. And just for your information, we've got people working on several subjects. We're working on the midcourse coming up to determine our control system and how to do it with the control system we select, what we should do about the alinement. We've got the LMS and a couple of crews cranked up working on that. And we're also working on our entry, how and when we ought to activate the CSM. And we're working on the CSM systems status. Tomorrow sometime we're going to have a MAIN BUS B checkout, so we've got a lot of people swinging pretty hard here and I've got some f-stop settings for you for the lunar-surface camera. At 1/250th, we'd like you to take targets of opportunity. Each picture use three f-stops, because we don't know exactly which one is going to work the best, so use 4, 5.6, and 8 and 1/250th for the surface camera. Copy?
Okay. Use the surface camera at 1/250th, 4, 5.6, and 8. And I've been doing quite a bit of shooting at covering two of those numbers in the range 5.6, and 8. I've also been shooting some at 11, so I'll just drop it down a little more. The Moon is still so big and bright there that I got a feeling that the Moon is probably up around the f/8 to f/11 range.
Roger, I didn't catch that last part. Maybe when the COMM gets a little better you can say it again.
Okay. How do you read now, Jack?
That's a lot better, Fred.
Okay, I just said the Moon is still so bright, that I think probably the higher range of f-stops will be better; f/8, maybe even f/11.
Okay.
I can just barely, on the left corner of the Moon now, make out the foothills of Fra Mauro formation. We never did get to see it when we were in close, there.
Okay. I'm reading on my monitor here, Fred, that you're 16214 miles away from the Moon moving at about 4500 feet per second.
Okay.
From the sounds of all the work that is going on and is still going on, this flight is probably a lot bigger test for the system on the ground than up here.
Yes, you've been - you've been working it out a little bit.
Yes. I've really got a tough job right now switching OMNIs.
Well, everybody down here is 100-percent optimistic. Looks like we're on the up side of the whole thing now.
Yes, I guess we had better be in good shape, particularly ourselves, rested for that entry day. I think that is going to be a pretty busy one.
Right, and we're working on procedures for that. Ken's been doing quite a bit of work on getting ready for entry.
Very good.
How's it going, Fred?
Okay. Just fine.
Okay. We're considering a midcourse correction at 104 hours - about 20 hours from now - 18 hours from now, and it's only 7 feet per second. The other option is to keep PTC up, since we may not be able to get back into it again, and delay it. So, that's the type of thing we're thinking about, but - just wanted to let you know that you're pretty much right in the middle of the fairway there and our present tracking, with no midcourse, has you - with a Gamma of 7.11, as opposed to 6.51. So, you're already in the corridor. You're just a half a degree between the center and the outer limits and we're going to tweek that up.
Okay. That sounds good.
And - we don't - Well, we think there might have been a misunderstanding earlier on the potable water. Don't worry about drinking water. Drink all you want. There's plenty of it. There's 38 pounds, and the Surgeon recommends that you use some of the fruit juices as well. Over.
Okay. Yes, we went up and - and used the procedure to pressurize surge tank, and Jack and I made up a total of 22 drinks of - drinking water.
Okay.
And I assume that Jack is up there sleeping now too, right?
Yes. That's affirm. They're both up there.
I hate to say it, Jack, but I think our PTC is about to wobble off a little bit. I've noticed that the Earth is coming by somewhat lower in the window and the Moon is going by somewhat higher.
Okay. Understand. PTC, Earth is coming by lower and Moon is coming by higher.
Yes.
And, Fred, on this jerry-rigged command module lithium hydroxide canister, what we're going to do is we're going to have to make at least two up and use two at a time - one on each set of hoses. What we'll do is we'll connect one of these jerry-rigged boxes to the red fittings and air will be sucked through the lithium hydroxide and then blown out the blue fitting. And we're also going to, when we do this, remove the LM lithium hydroxide canister from the suit loop, either the primary or the secondary, and we're getting the words together to make it easy to build one of these things, and it looks like it will probably take two guys, so, I think we probably ought to plan to do that later. In addition, we have to go up and get a couple of canisters out of the command module, so it looks like maybe a smart idea would be to delay a little bit and have you build a couple of these later on. What do you think?
Yes. I agree, Jack. Jack Swigert and I went upstairs earlier and both got a canister, and we were scratching around for some material and thinking about using them, and that's actually why - when we made up all the water to drink because we needed the plastic container that they were housed in in the pantry, and we had that ready to use with some material plus some of the - the extra porous bags that were going to be used for the dump control that we may just cut up and use, too.
Did you come up with a design or - -
Plus we got lots - -
No. We just thought we'd see what we had in the way of material and stand by for your word. Of course, we also have lots of stiff-backed cardboard flight data.
Yes. We have decided to use a canister and, you know that the liquid-cooled garment has a bag around it that we think we can use, too, or that we know we can use. We've tried it. So what you have is the - a bag within a bag and inside that is the liquid-cooled garment. The bag that is closest to the liquid-cooled garment is the one we need, and we've got two of them. And then, of course, we've got to use some tape and, as you say, one of the backs to flight data file time line book or something like that, and, just using those materials, we can make this jerry-rigged canister. So, the bag that we're looking for is the one that is right next to the liquid-cooled garment, and, if we're very careful about where we cut it, we can make a pretty good rig.
Okay.
It looks like we'll have to use that bag over again, though, because we only got two of them, and I expect that we'll have to make more than two of these canisters up.
Roger.
Fred, in about 4 minutes, we're going to hand you over to a different communications site, and it's going to take us about a minute or so to reestablish uplink, so you can be prepared for that.
Okay, Jack.
Fred-o, we've handed over now. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Jack.
Same here.
In fact, you're coming in a little louder.
Fred, you'll have to say again. Can't read you there. There's too much background noise. Maybe we need a new antenna.
Okay. I'm on the other OMNI now. I just said that you're coming in even louder than previously.
Roger. Maybe it's because I'm standing up. You're coming in better now, too.
And, for your information, Jack, I'm just going to tear into some beef and gravy and other assorted goodies.
I presume that you're doing this with the full permission and - of the commander.
And this - at this moment, who do you think is the commander?
If I was him, I'd make you sign out everything you ate, so I'd know.
Well, I'm sneaking inside of the LM where he doesn't have ... Incidentally, this PTC must have some - must have a wobble mode around our X-axis there because now the Moon and Earth are back in the right perspective.
Good. Let's see if it goes the other way.
These guys down here are saying they knew it all the time.
Well, that's right. They do good work. Whoever heard of doing a P52 in the LM?
Say, Fred, sometime when you're not too busy chewing on that beef, how about telling us what the CO<sub>2</sub> reads?
Okay, I'm reading 13, 1 3.
Okay. It looks like our reading is getting kind of close to yours.
Yes. It appears the wobble is going the other way, Jack, because the Earth is now rising and the Moon is starting to get lower in the window.
Roger. Could you give us an LPD number periodically?
LPD number? Yes, okay.
In fact, if you could give it two or three REVs in a row, why then we could predict where it's going and maybe help us set it up again if we have to.
Okay.
Okay. The center of the Earth has just gone by at an LPD number of 4.
Roger. LPD 4, center of the Earth.
And the center of the Moon is about LPD 21.
Okay. LPD 21. Is that the center of the Moon, you say?
That's affirm.
And, Fred, we're doing a little better on our water than we had anticipated. Our numbers were designed for 3.5 pounds per hour; we're using about 3.0, and expect to go a little bit less.
Beautiful.
When this flight's all over, we'll really be able to figure out what a LM can do.
Maybe it'll make the ...
If it had a heat shield, I'd say bring it home.
Okay. The Earth went - just went by about - clear above the LPD index. It was - it was, if it were extended, the number would be minus 6.
Okay. Way up there at minus 6.
Yes, there's actually no such number. I just extended the line beyond zero which, for a negative rate, is what it would be if there was one.
Right. If minus 6 was there, that's where it would be. Right?
That's right.
Do you still have that super-dense star field?
It's still there. I'm looking at it right now. I can look at - the Sun is right behind me, then all these sparklies show up. Yes. It kind of looks like I'm right in the middle of the - of the Milky Way. There are several thousand little sparklies at various ranges out as far as I can see ...
They're kind of interesting. They're all moving ... and sparkling there. And I can ... - at least I think I can what will occasionally give you a real star from the bunch of sparklies, but it really does break up the capability to pick out a star pattern, particularly through ...
Okay. So far, we haven't identified what the sparklies are and what is venting.
Yes, I got a. ... feeling that we probably won't get any ... until we power up.
How you feeling, Fred?
Oh, as soon as I chug down this grape drink and grapefruit - orange drink, I think I'll be in pretty good shape.
How much sleep did you get between the burn and the time you got up for this exercise?
Oh, I'd guesstimate about 4 hours, Jack. Wait a minute, which burn you talking about?
It was the burn we just made. Did you get any sleep between it, and the time you got up for this watch?
Oh, no. I didn't - I haven't been to bed since all the action the night before, and I went to go to bed for about 4 hours then ...
Yes.
Well, we're just trying to figure out who's likely to be the most tired up there. You or Jim.
I think we'll get caught up pretty good in the next couple of days.
Say again.
We ought to get caught up pretty good in the next couple of days.
Okay, Jack. The Earth has started back down. The hack on the LPD there was 1 degree.
Okay. One degree on the center of the Earth.
That was a good TV show you put on the other night, Fred, during LM entry.
Yes. It would have been an even better one about 10 minutes later.
Yes. Things sure turned to worms there in a hurry after that show.
Yes. You're right.
Okay. The center of the Moon new is about minus 2 degrees LPD.
Minus 2 degrees, center of the Moon.
Charlie said to say hello.
Who's that?
Charlie.
Is he still around there?
Unless my watch is wrong, it says it's almost 2 a.m. back there.
No. That's the bearded one.
Oh! Okay.
Hey, tell Charlie that I'll be back down there personally to thank him for this baby.
Sure will. I did.
Okay. The Earth went by there, Jack, at LPD about 18 degrees.
Roger. We copy 18 degrees for the center of the Earth.
Okay. The Moon - I'd estimate it up around minus - somewhere 17 to minus 20 degrees LPD.
Okay. Moon's minus 17 to minus 20.
How would you like to spend a week on an aircraft carrier getting back?
If I can get on an aircraft carrier, I don't care how long it takes, Jack.
They're going to take you by helo to Samoa. You'll spend the night in Samoa, get on a 141, and be at Ellington shortly thereafter.
Okay. Kind of sounds like the original plans for the ...
Had you worrying that you're going to spend the night on the ship, helo to Samoa and directly to Ellington.
Very good.
Boy, these thrusters are sure ... ...
Fred, I'm not reading you. Maybe we'd better wait until we change antennas or unless you can speak up a little louder.
How do you read now?
Better.
Okay. The thrusters ... and the ... outside ... and they hardly look like they ... ...
Gee, I'm sorry, Fred. We're just not reading you right now. Maybe we'll have to wait a little bit.
Okay.
Let's try it now. If you can speak up, the background noise has gone down a little bit.
Okay. How do you read now?
A little better.
I was just commenting - I've been looking here at the thrusters on quads 1 and 4. We've got a slight discoloration on the outside of the barrel. The nozzles look like they hadn't ever been fired, - like they're brand new. ... of like those skinny things on the interior on the upper nozzle ...
You say the coloration of the thrusters appears they haven't been fired on quads 1 and 4?
I'm saying all of them look clean again. I guess they've fired so clean that they don't seem to ... at all. ... different color, ... copper, bronze, color of the oxygen cell. They've been fired because I watched them fire. Okay. The Earth's going by at an LPD of 42.
Roger. Copy LPD 42. Is that affirm?
That's affirm.
And, Fred, that may be why the COMM is a little bit degraded, more background noise, because we're getting out of attitude a little bit there.
Roger.
How do you read on AFT OMNI now ...?
I'm reading you, Fred. I've got a lot of background noise. Looks like it might come and go with attitude.
Yes. I think that's probably - just looking through the command module at you now.
How do you read now, Jack?
About the same, Fred.
Okay.
Okay. And the Moon just went by at about minus 14 degrees.
Okay, the Moon at minus 14.
That - that's correct.
Okay. Your landing in - your weather in the landing area, which is about 560 miles south of Samoa, is now predicted to be about 1500, scattered, high broken. Waves are going to be 5 feet, the winds are going to be 15 knots, visibility 20 miles, showers in less than 10 percent of the area, and you will be landing at 08:00 local, roughly.
Hey, that all sounds pretty good.
Say, Fred, did you get the dope on the Saturn IV impact - S-IVB impact?
Yes. Just as we came around the corner, Vance, they told us that it hit - I don't recall the position now, but it was a ... impact ... and recorded it on the ... seismometer.
Yes. It impacted 74 nautical miles from the ALSEP and the passive seismic detected major seismic activity on all long period channels and this was - this activity was detected for 4 hours afterwards with decreasing amplitude. And the impact also was detected by the high-energy channels ... The high-energy channel of the SIDE.
Yes. That ought to add ...
Okay. The Earth LPD number that time was 32.
Roger. Thirty-two.
How do you read now, Jack?
I'm reading you, Fred. I've got a lot of background noise, though.
Jack, I can definitely tell we're moving away from the Moon, now. I got it all in the monocular at one time. We're right over the top of FPA 8 right now.
You're right over the top of what?
On a point between it and Censorinus - FPA 8 and - the point halfway between there and Censorinus.
Fred-o, would say the checkpoint over which you're right now?
Okay. And incidentally, the LPD on the Moon was zero, so it's coming back down. The point looks like we're just about straight over is around Censorinus and the point between it and FPA 8.
Okay.
Okay. And, Jack, the Earth LPD angle is 24 degrees.
Roger. Earth at 24. And it looks like you're getting up to about 15 on the CO<sub>2</sub>, so we want you to select SECONDARY and swap out the primary cartridge. Over.
Okay. I'll select SECONDARY and swap out the primary cartridge.
Okay, Fred. And when you select - When you swap out the primary cartridge, don't reselect PRIMARY. Stay on SECONDARY until we use the secondary up. Over.
Okay. I'm changing out primary and - stay in SECONDARY until we use it up.
And the change out is complete, Jack.
Okay. Copy the changeout complete, and we're reading 4.5 on the CO<sub>2</sub> here.
Okay. I'm ...
Okay. And the Earth LPD was 8 degrees.
Did you - Did you say 8 degrees, Fred?
Affirmative.
Okay.
Well, I missed the Moon on that one, Jack. But I would guess - estimating back a little bit, the LPD angle was somewhere around 42.
Fred, I'm having a hard time reading you, but I think you're giving me a LPD angle.
Roger. That's it, Jack. The Moon is about 42.
You say the Moon is at 22?
Four two, 42.
Okay, 4 2. Thank you.
How you doing there, Fred?
...
Okay, Fred. I can just barely hear you saying something in the background and I can't make out what it is.
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Hello there, Aquarius. Go ahead.
Roger. And Fred is being relieved now. He's - went back to get some rest. This is Lovell here who's got the duty.
Gee whiz. You got up kind of early, didn't you?
It's cold back there in the command module.
Well, what we were really thinking about doing was letting you sleep a little bit longer because we figure you're pretty worn out.
Well, I'll go back and forth once in a while to get a ...
Is Jack up there with you?
No, Jack's still sacked out.
Okay, Jim. We're kind of watching this PTC a little bit. Fred's been giving us a few LPD angles as we swang by the center of the Earth - center of the Moon. We noticed that the COMM has been degrading just a little bit so you might have to talk up.
Roger. Understand.
And we just went on to the secondary CO<sub>2</sub> canister. Fred swapped out the primary, but we want to stay on the secondary until it is all used up.
Okay. I'm going to use the tape ... CO<sub>2</sub>.
We're reading a partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub> of 4.2 millimeters. We're cleared to use the secondary until it reaches 15.
Okay. That's good.
Aquarius, in comparing our initial estimates of water usage and electrical power usage, it appears that we're right on the money on water usage, and we're using a little less amperes than we had originally expected in our first analysis, so we're either right on the money or just a little bit ahead of the game in that regard.
Well, that sounds encouraging, Jack.
And there are a few temperatures that we're watching for you. You have the heaters powered down. We're looking at them, and those include the PIPAs, the ASA, the quad temps, and your propellants, except for the DPS propellant.
Okay. I've got them here.
We have, as you probably know, several groups working on procedures from here on out. We have a group working on midcourse corrections to determine a system, the attitudes, how to do it, alinement techniques, and so forth. We have a group working on the entry, including how and when we're going to activate the CSM. We have a group working on the CSM system status, and in a few hours - Later on tomorrow, from where we see it, we're going to go to some base configuration on the CSM and we're going to conduct a MAIN BUS B check. Right now the COMM is kind of degrading, and I can't hear what you're about to say very well. But I just want to keep you advised as to how things are going here. And remember you've got duty on the antennas.
Aquarius, are you reading Houston?
...
Okay, Jim. I can hear you talking but I can't tell what you're saying because you're way down in the background noise.
Okay. Can you hear Aquarius now? Over.
Oh, yes. That's much better. Did you get my report on the various types of people and what they're doing around here?
Roger. Sounds like you had things well organized. You might also consider what kind of a stowage configuration ... and what we can leave behind in Aquarius.
Okay, Jim. I didn't catch that suggestion on account of the background noise; maybe we can pass it on when it gets more favorable.
I'm thinking in terms of stowage. Whether we would leave the suit. ... the Hycon camera in Aquarius, prior to ...
Okay. I heard you say something about using the Hycon camera in Aquarius.
Negative, Jack. I'm thinking of reentry stowage attitude. Whether we should - what we should leave behind in Aquarius. Leave the suits behind; leaving such big items as the Hycon cameras in Aquarius. Over.
Oh, understand. You're thinking about stowage. What'll we leave behind in Aquarius when we fall back into Odyssey. Is that right?
That's affirmative.
Okay. We've people working on that, too.
And we presently are tracking you at 22 500 miles from the Moon, moving out at 4400 feet a second.
Aquarius. Roger.
And, Jim, earlier in the evening, we thought there was a misunderstanding about the amount of potable water you can drink, but we want to advise you that you can drink as much water as you want to. There's 38 pounds in the potable tank, and that's about all you'll need. The doctors suggest you drink as much fruit juices as you want, too.
Roger, Jack.
Jim, earlier in the evening, Fred-o reported some venting out of window number 1 in the command module. He also reported a piece of loose metal about 4 inches square, silver, floating by, and one thing we were trying to establish is whether or not this is a new venting or whether this is part of the residual venting of our original problem. Do you have any more words or comments? And one thing he was doing was taking some photographs and we authorized photographs, targets of opportunity, using the lunar-surface camera number 1, and use the setting of 1/250 of a second, and not knowing precisely what f-stop to use, we suggested taking three of each, using settings of f:4, f:5.6, and f:8. Over.
Roger, Jack. The venting really seems to ... I reported earlier, I also spotted the large piece go by and prior to our ... burn ... The venting you see now is much greater ... went into the dark mode, you could easily distinguish stars and didn't have the bright articles and bright objects, and I also have the camera here to take photographs. ...
Okay, Jim. Once again I hear you talking back there but I can only pick out a few words; maybe we'll have a better time.
Aquarius, we're trying to improve our communications. Could you turn the BIOMED off and give us a voice check, please?
Voice check follows: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1; voice check out.
Okay, Jim. That seemed to be better.
How are you doing there, Aquarius?
We're doing good, Jack.
Okay. Sometime when you get two guys available there and you could construct one of these lithium hydroxide rigs, I'd like to have you get the materials together, and we'll go through the steps together.
Okay. Sounds good. And how do you read me now?
Well, there is a lot of background noise, and sometimes it is worse than others and right now I hear you better than I have in the past.
Okay, Jack. I'm kind of curious the amount of perturbations our PTC attitude is taking. I notice that we are getting off attitude, and I'm just kind of curious how far we can let this go.
We were tracking the attitudes with Fred earlier and it looked like what we were doing was oscillating about some point, but coming back. Are you detecting some kind of divergence now?
Not too much. I notice that it's different than when I went to sleep. We are more at an angle now with the terminator of the Earth, so when we started out, we were just about parallel with the terminator, and now we are canted off somewhat. I haven't seen any trends, though, of going back and forth.
And, Jim, our current plan is to not correct the PTC. We're going to take whatever we get and live with it. And we can kind of keep track of what's going on a little better if when you swing past the Earth and swing past the center of the Moon, if you could read off the LPD angles for the center of the Earth and the center of the Moon. Over.
Roger. Will do, Jack. And I'm looking into the AOT now to the right - No, the number 4 detent, and we are venting something back there; I can see particles moving on past the command module. What it is, I don't know.
Okay. Can you identify the quadrant?
Well, I'm looking through the right rear reticle now of the AOT, and when I was back in the command module, I could see it out of the CM 1 window. The particles are rather small, but they are coming out with some force. That's probably what is disturbing our PTC attitude.
Yes, that sounds quite probable, Jim. That's about the same report we got from Fred, but we haven't been able to identify what they might be and probably won't be able to until we crank up the CSM. If there's any change in that status, why, we just want to keep advised of it.
Roger. Understand.
And, Aquarius, we are setting a pretty good vector on you now. And it looks like you're a little bit outside of the corridor. We're looking at a 7-foot-per-second midcourse at 104 hours. We are going to come up with an entry interface minus 8 pad to use in the event of a loss of COMM situation
Roger. Understand, and I hope you have that procedure for attitude.
We are ginning up a procedure for attitude for you, Jim. For the no-COMM case, it may be a little different than what the guys working on the procedures come up with for the burn at 104 hours.
Roger.
What I'm saying, Jim, is the guys who are working on this attitude situation for the burns haven't made their final conclusions yet, but in the interim period, we want to come up with something you can use, in the event that you lose COMM.
I concur.
Houston, Aquarius. The Earth is going through the 10-degree line or angle of the LPD.
Okay, We copied 10 degrees. Is that Earth or Moon, Jim?
That is Earth.
Okay. Earth 10 degrees. Thank you.
And, Houston ... As we ... No! ... has an angle of about 24 degrees on the LPD.
Okay. We read 24, Jim.
That's affirm.
Jack, ... the LPD on the Moon now is 22 degrees.
Okay. I'm reading you better, Jim. Say again, please.
Roger. The LPD now on the Moon is 22 degrees. I missed the Earth last time. I'll get it this time.
Okay. Twenty-two degrees, and looks like we've come up with a procedure for the attitude control on the upcoming burns. Probably the ones that we'll use from here on out.
Okay, Jack. Stand by 1.
It's going to be a few minutes before I'm ready to read it up to you.
Okay.
Jack, on the first of the LPD angles is about a minus 2 degrees and just slightly above the top line.
Okay. Just went by minus 2 degrees. Is that on the Earth?
That's the Earth. Now, I don't know whether we're oscillating back and forth or not, Jack, or whether it's a continual motion. We'll have to see here.
Roger.
Okay, Jack. The Moon now has an LPD angle of 10 degrees
Roger. The Moon at 10 degrees.
Okay, Jim. Just as kind of a lead-in to this procedure that we're going to use for the mid-course to use AGS and it's going to be a manual burn. The attitude will be controlled manually; the start/stop on the engine will be controlled manually. So we have a pretty good vector on you now, and it turns out you're coming in a little bit too shallow. So what that means is we're going to make our burn to come in a little more steeply, and we're going to be coming in around the dark side of the Earth. Therefore, to come in more steep, our thrust should be in the direction of the Sun. Does that all make sense to you?
I think so. We're going to use AGS for a burn monitor. The burns are going to be manual, and they're going to be started manually and stopped manually.
Okay. And your reentry is around the dark side of the Earth, and since we're coming in shallow, we're going to have to burn toward the Sun to make it steeper. Do you follow that?
That's affirm. Especially these burns will be perpendicular to our flight path and to the Sun giving a steeper entry angle.
Okay, Jim. I heard you say perpendicular to your flight path, which is affirmative, and I didn't get the rest of your statement.
I understand the technique, Jack. We're burning to give us time to steepen our entry angle, and it will be perpendicular to our flight path for corridor control.
Okay. That's affirmative. So, in general terms, what we're going to have to do is to power up the AGS and bring up the AGS eight-ball, and then to set up your attitude, put the COAS in the front window, and guidance control will be in AGS, of course. But manually orient the spacecraft to place the center of the Earth directly out the Z-axis. Then rotate about the Z-axis to place the point of the crescent on the Y-axis of the COAS. And this will have your plus X-axis in the direction of the Sun as we discussed before. So the crescent will be up with the point down. Copy that?
Okay, Jack. We'll have to go over what again. The COAS will be out front window; we'll place the Earth in the center of the COAS, and, let's see, the center of the Earth right now is parallel to the LPD which is about parallel to our X-axis. And we'll have to rotate about 90 degrees
Okay, Jim. So we want to get the Y-axis of the spacecraft parallel to the terminator by putting the points of the crescent on the Y-axis.
Roger. Understand.
Seriously, Jack, when I stop the spacecraft looking at - at the Earth, I'm going to have to roll - in LM terms, roll the spacecraft 90 degrees to get the tip of the Earth all on the Y-axis.
That's affirmative, Jim. You're going to have to roll 90 degrees to point your plus X-axis at the Sun and put the crescent - the points of the crescent on the Y-axis. The points of the crescent on the Y-axis with the COAS pointed at the center of the Earth will take care of your yaw and your pitch.
Roger.
Okay, Jim. After you get that orientation to come in a little more steeply, we perform an AGS body-axis aline which is at 400 plus 5 on the DEDA. If the AGS ball is up at this time, the AGS ball will go to 000. We can talk more about control modes later, but we'd recommend doing this, of course, in AGS ATTITUDE HOLD - ATTITUDE HOLD. Put your YAW to MODE CONTROL and leave PITCH and ROLL in PULSE, therefore, controlling your attitude with the TTCA. We don't want to use the gimbal, so have ENGINE GIMBAL OFF. We'll make these burns at 10-percent thrust. We'll use a manual start and stop. For ullage, we'll use the PLUS-X TRANSLATIONAL button, and ullage will be for 10 seconds. Over.
Okay. I understand what you're saying, but you'll have to repeat it here.
Okay. We'll perform the burn in GUIDANCE CONTROL to AGS. And MODE CONTROL to ATTITUDE HOLD. Your ATTITUDE CONTROL switches will be ROLL to PULSE, PITCH to PULSE, and YAW to MODE CONTROL. So the AGS will control your yaw and you will use the TTCA to control pitch and roll. ENGINE GIMBAL OFF; 10-percent thrust. Start and stop manual. For ullage, use the plus-X translational button; 10 seconds ullage. Over.
Okay. For the burn there will be go to GUIDANCE CONTROL AGS, MODE CONTROL ATT HOLD, ATTITUDE CONTROL switches will be ROLL PULSE, PITCH PULSE, YAW MODE CONTROL. We'll use TTCA control for pitch and roll. ENGINE GIMBAL will be OFF; we'll be using 10-percent thrust; we'll start and stop manually, the ... control ullage will be a PLUS-X TRANSLATIONAL button. And also our thrust will still be, but before that we are going to do an AGS aline ... ball ...
That's affirmative, Jim. After you get oriented in the attitude you want to burn in, do an AGS aline which is - an AGS body-axis aline which is 400 plus 5. When you get ENTER, this will bring ball up to 000, and I want to confirm that you - that you said ENGINE GIMBAL OFF. O-F-F. Over.
Roger. Confirm that ENGINE GIMBAL will be off.
And, Jack, how long do you estimate the length of the burns will be?
Okay. The length of the burns are going to be probably less than a minute. And we want you to have cut-off based on time. So we will give you a burn time. And I have a P30 maneuver pad for midcourse-7 in the event that we lose COMM if you are ready to copy.
Okay, Jack. Ready to copy.
Okay, Jim. P30 LM maneuver pad: the purpose is midcourse-7. NOUN 33 is 134:59:42.98. NOUN 81 is N/A. H<sub>A</sub> is N/A. H<sub>P</sub> is plus 0020.5. DELTA-V R is 0019.3. Burn time, 0:39; 008, 000; the rest is N/A; thrust will be at 10 percent. Read back.
All right. This is midcourse-7 corridor control, and it's in case we lose COMM: 134:59:42.98; NOUN 81 is N/A; 42, N/A; plus 0020.5; 0019.3. Burn time, 0:39; 008, 000. All the rest is N/A: thrust 10 percent.
Okay, Jim. That's a good readback, and in the event of lost COMM, use the procedures that I gave you. It may be that between now and tomorrow these procedures will change a little bit, so we'll go with what we've got now, and stand by for something better if it comes. Over.
Okay, Jack. I'm looking at your burn pad and I see that the ... total gimbal ... 19.3 feet per second.
Okay, Jim. We verify 19.3 feet per second for 39 seconds.
The old midcourse technique sounds like something that we came up with on Apollo 8.
Yes, everybody wondered if you would remember that; by golly, you did.
Hey, Jim, I got a little bit more information - maneuver pad, I got LAT/LONG range to go, VERB 10 and GET; if you got a place to copy that down, I'll give it to you for EMS.
Okay. Stand by.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. I just have the last three blocks. NOUN 61: latitude, minus 021.62; longitude, minus 265.37; range to go, 2162.9; VERB 10:36291: GET of .05g is 142:41:30; read back.
I didn't get the latitude, but the longitude is minus 165.67; range to go, 11629; velocity 36291; 142:41:30.
Okay, Jim. The latitude is minus 021.62; I have a correction on the longitude - minus 165.37. Go ahead.
Roger, Jack. The latitude is minus 21.62; longitude is minus 165.37, and this goes in conjunction with that midcourse 7 pad you gave us.
That's affirmative. That means no maneuvers between now and midcourse 7. And this is a horizontal in-plane burn, plus X, toward the Sun, 19.3 feet per second.
Roger. ...
And, Jim, on the - Setting up the AGS, right after you do the 400 plus 5, you should do a 400 plus all balls. And one other point we want to clarify is that we know that you're sure that this burn will be made with the plus X-axis pointing at the Sun to make the entry angle steeper. You got it?
That's right, Jack. What I'm going to do is - We'll stop with the Earth in the commander's window, the COAS down, and then I'm going to maneuver the spacecraft so that I have the lighted portion of the Earth at the top of the window; that is, the COAS will be along the plus-Y of the spacecraft and the top of the window - of the rendezvous window, I should be looking into the Sun. That means I'll be burning towards the Sun and steepening the angle.
That's affirm, Jim. I - You got the attitude right, and did you copy about doing a 400 plus all balls after - you do the 400 plus 5? That is, a 400 plus 5 and a 400 plus all zeros back to back.
Roger. I have copied that.
Jack - this is Aquarius. I'm not too sure how long or with what force the venting is going to do to our trajectory. However, you might keep a check on that. It may have been going on for some time.
Roger, Jim. We've been taking a look at it. We haven't been able to detect it on the Doppler, however.
Roger.
But we think it's pretty small.
And, Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Jack, would you give me a time hack on an even GET so I can start my watch.
Okay. Coming up on 87 hours and 35 minutes, we will be there in 30 seconds. Set it for 87.35.
Just give me a hack at 88 hours.
Okay. I'll give you a hack at 88 hours. That'll be another 25 minutes.
All right. Thanks.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay, Jack. Let's just talk over how I'm going to get to the attitude and then do the burn. What I'm talking about is the control techniques. The way it looks now I'll try to stop the spacecraft in yaw with the Earth out my window, then we'll be in GUIDANCE or we'll be AGS CONTROL; we'll be in - yaw will be in MODE CONTROL. Then we'll be using the TTCA|TTCAs to control the pitch and then control the roll. I don't see another way we can control the combination that we have here without using the TTCA|TTCAs. Then we will also use the TTCA during engine burn. Do you people concur with that technique?
Jim, that sounds like the one that is best to use to me. Let me talk it over with the rest of the guys here, and we'll advise you.
Okay.
Jim, in that control mode, that sounds like the best way to go. The only thing you'll have to do is to get ATTITUDE HOLD in the AGS, and so before you start to maneuver, you'll have to bring the AGS up, and get a 400 plus all zeros in there, and then AGS will respond in yaw when you go to MODE CONTROL. That is, AGS will control your yaw in MODE CONTROL and your pitch and roll can be taken care of in PULSE with a TTCA. After you get in attitude, then, you'll have to re-do an AGS body axis aline which is 400 plus 5, then go back to 400 plus all zeros again.
Right, Jack. That was my next question. I don't want to aline the AGS ball 000 until I am in position, so we use that as a primary attitude burn monitor device.
And, Jim, you can do a 400 plus all zeros any time you want to; that just tells the AGS that you want it to control your attitude should you go to ATTITUDE HOLD in MODE CONTROL.
Roger. I understand, but after we get to the attitude, we'll do a 400 plus 5 to get the AGS aline ball, and then we'll do a 400 plus zero.
Affirmative.
Another thing, Jim, is while you're maneuvering to that attitude using AGS to control your yaw, if you find out enroute to that attitude that you didn't quite have the yaw where you wanted it to be, you can use your ACA and tweak up the yaw, and your AGS needles go right back to zero because you zero the attitude errors.
Roger. Sounds good.
Jim, you'll be splashing down about 560 miles southeast of Samoa at about 0800 local time. The weather forecast for the area is good; 1500, scattered, high broken, 10-mile visibility. The seas will be 5-foot waves, 15 knots, and you'll be going to Samoa by boat and/or aircraft. You'll spend either the night on the boat or in Samoa and return to Ellington by 141 on Saturday, the following day.
Roger. Would you tell the people of the LRL to turn it off.
Oh, no. We're going to do the whole bit.
And don't forget my hack at 88 hours, Jack.
Say again, please, Aquarius.
I want to get my time hack at 88 hours.
Roger. That will be in about 6-1/2 more minutes.
Roger.
Jim, we got a couple of news-type items. President Nixon has chosen a judge from Minnesota for the position of Associate Justice in the Supreme Court. A bill giving federal employees a 6-percent pay raise passed the House and went to the President; includes the military. And the air traffic controllers returned to work.
Well, that's great. You think they'll consider this for flight pay?
Well, we might be able to work out some arrangement.
Standing by for the 88-hour time hack.
Say again, Jim.
Standing by for the 88-hour time hack.
Okay. We got a minute to go.
Okay. Coming up on the 88-hour mark. I'll give you a 2-second delay. Stand by to mark.
MARK.
I got it.
How are you doing, Jim?
Pretty good, Jack. Say, you might have the people look at our DPS burn card to see what changes have to be made on it for the burn.
Heard you say look at the DPS burn; you'll have to say what about it again, please.
Roger, Jack. You might take a look at our DPS burn card, our checklist card that we have in the LM, and see what changes might have to be put in that checklist.
Okay, DPS burn card.
How're you doing there, Jim?
Okay, Jack. It appears that we're going - funny diversion here, the PTC attitude in - in pitch. I'm going to do a LPD check now, but the last time the Moon went around, it was above - way away above the LPD angle and I see the Earth coming around now which is going to be pretty low. They oscillate back and forth, but each time they seem to get a little farther away from the center line. You might think of some procedure to reestablish PTC, if it's necessary.
Okay.
Jim, the only way we know of getting the as good or a better PTC than you've got right now is to crank up the G & N and we - We don't want to do that. So our plan is to just take whatever we get out of this, and later on, it may turn out by the time you get to burn attitude, you'll be right where you want to be.
Okay. We'll just leave her go.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
What's our course of action to set up PTC after this midcourse at 107?
We thought you'd ask that.
The only thing we can try to do, Jim, is to get the thing up manually and see what happens. There must be a better answer than that - -
Okay.
- - and one course of action is to omit the midcourse and make a total midcourse, say, about 8 hours before entry. We haven't decided yet.
Right now we're talking about a 7-foot-per-second midcourse at 104 hours. And extrapolate that down to about 8 hours before entry. We gave you a pad for that - that's about, only 19 feet per second, so if it doesn't change too much - and we can get all kinds of DPS.
Understand. Sure like to keep this vehicle in the corridor though.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Can you think of any normal venting phenomena that might occur like maybe - a hydrogen tank that's over-pressurized relieving in the window?
Yes, we thought of that, Jim.
That is one possibility that we've though of, Jim, because - We heated up that tank, and we haven't been using any hydrogen and, therefore, it could be venting in the overboard release.
Right. The only other thing I can think of when I look at it through the AOT is - it did appear to be coming from one spot; but that's the only difference although I can't see where it is coming from because it's beyond the curvature of the command module. But, it appears like it might be coming from more than this one spot.
Okay. Thank you. We hope that when we crank up the command module tomorrow that we'll be able to - or later on today - that we will be able to identify more closely what it's been coming from. But, the guidance guys say that they haven't been able to see the results of any venting in their data and it would take a very, very small amount to perturb their data.
Well, that's a note of encouragement.
(Music)
You got a Chinese band going up there?
Oh, sorry. I forgot all about hot mike.
Sounds pretty good.
Jim, we've had you scheduled for an eat period about an hour ago. I suppose you've taken care of that. The other thing is we're kind of interested in knowing how long you're going to be at stick there, or if you're going to go back to bed or what?
Okay, Jack. We're - We're going to set up a regular watch and sleep period here. Fred was up for a long time, so I got up a little bit early to relieve him. Jack and Fred are now asleep, so I'm going to let them sleep as long as they can, and then we'll have an eat period and then I'll go back to bed for a bit. And we'll separate the schedule.
Okay. We're right at the point now where, according to the flight plan that we had made up for you, that you would have all finished eating and you and Jack would have the duty while Fred went to sleep. So, essentially, according to the plan we've got, you got up about 3 or 4 hours early. And - The next time that we have that as a rest period for you is at 96 hours, which is 7 hours from now, and an hour before that, say at 95 hours, all three of you would eat, and then you and Jack would hit the sack again and Fred would have the duty until 102 hours. We'd be glad to take care of this work-rest cycle for you.
Okay. That's good. Let me - Let me wait until they get up, or at least Jack gets up. He should be getting up before Fred. And we'll try to get back on the schedule. I hate to wake everybody up right now though, if they're sleeping.
Okay. Your choice on that. As soon as Jack gets up, I'd suggest we go ahead and break up these lithium hydroxide canisters and make a couple of them. Jack could work on that. It's going to take four sets of hands, I think.
Okay. We'll make that the project, getting the lithium hydroxide canister squared away.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Hi, Jim. We've got a flight handover in about 2 minutes, and we'll have a temporary loss of COMM. You don't need to switch antennas. Over.
Okay; fine.
Aquarius, Houston through Madrid for a COMM check. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Joe. How me?
Okay, Jim.
... asleep?
I ... Maybe ... ...
They have got a procedure for ... the lithium hydroxide ...
... on secondary. We'll let it go to 15. Why don't you get on a headset, and I'll be down ... for ...
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay Jack's up with me now and you all ... procedure for making these lithium hydroxide devices, and soon as he gets on his helmet, he'll be ready to copy, and then he'll get started making one.
Roger that, Jim. Understand - -
On second thought -
Go ahead.
I'll give Jack the headset for a while and he'll copy down your instructions.
Okay, Jim. I didn't copy your second thought. Over.
I'll give Jack the headset and let him copy the instructions.
Okay, Jim. The way I thought it might be best to do it would be to have you gather the equipment and let us talk you through your procedure while you do it. Now, maybe you could give Jack the headset and - and - get the equipment together, and we'll talk you through the procedure. I think it'll be a little easier to do that way than if you tried to copy it all down - and then go do it.
Okay. Do you have any equipment listed? I'll just get it and give it to him and I can just sit here where I am.
Okay. I think the equipment you'll need will be two command module lithium hydroxide canisters, a roll of the gray tape, the two LCGs, because we're going to use the bags from the LCGs, and one - one LM cue card - one of those cardboard cue cards which you will cut off about an inch and a half out from the ring. Now, I think that's all we'll need. Over.
Okay. ... Okay, Houston.
Hello, Houston.
Go ahead, Jim.
Okay. That's two lithium hydroxide canisters, one roll of that special gray tape, two LCGs which we're going to use the bags from, one LM cue card and ...
Okay. That's affirmative, Jim. If you'll just cut the cue card, which is a handy piece of stiff paper the right size, about an inch and a half from the rings. Just cut off the ring holes, in other words, and you'll have a card about 11 inches long and probably 6 inches wide, something like that.
Okay, ... I'll have Jack gather up the stuff.
Okay.
... that roll of gray tape.
... Okay. ... and ... plastic bags.
Yes. Bring it down here. One LM cue card. I get that.
Okay. I got the canisters.
...
...?
...
Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
Yes. Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
We have gathered the materials, and I can put Jack on the headset and he can copy the instructions copy it to give them to him, or do you think they're too detailed?
Why don't you put him on the headsets, Jim, and I'll read it out to him.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. ...
Okay, Jack. Did anybody ever tell you that you got a 60-day extension on your income tax. Over.
Yes. I think - I think somebody said that when you are out of your country, you get a 60-day extension.
Okay; right. Okay. I'm ready to start into the procedure. When you answer me back, speak up - speak up into the microphone, because our downlink is pretty noisy. The first thing we want you to do, and we'll do this on one canister, and then let you go ahead and repeat it on the second. So take one of the LCGs and cut off the outer bag. By cutting along one the heat seals; do it carefully and close to the heat seal, because we may have to use the outer bag if we damage the inner bag. So go ahead and do that, and then we'll do the next step.
Okay. Take an LCG, cut the outer bag by the heat seal. Be careful not to damage the inner bag. Right?
Right. Just cut along one side.
Hey, Houston, Odyssey - or Aquarius. We've done that.
Okay, Jack. Now - now remove the inner bag from the outer bag, and cut the inner bag, also, along one of the heat seals down one side.
Okay. Remove the inner bag from the outer bag, cut the inner bag along the heat seal along one side.
Okay. That's correct. Do that, and report.
Okay, Joe. We've got that done.
Okay, Jack. Now you can put the LCG itself; that is, take it out of the inner bag, put it in the outer bag, and stow it some place; we recommend U-1, but you can stow it wherever it's convenient.
... outer bag ... I'd stow it back in ...
Okay, Joe. We've got that.
Okay. Now pick up one of the lithium hydroxide canisters, and let me describe which end is which. It's approximately square on one - one of the vented flat ends, has the strap, and that end we call the top, the end opposite we call the bottom. Is that clear? Over.
Right.
Okay. I've got it, Joe.
Okay. Now then, we're - we want you to take the tape and cut out two pieces about 3 feet long, or a good arm's length, and what you're - what we want you to do with them is to make two belts around the sides of the canister, one belt near the top and one belt near the bottom, with the sticky side out; wrap it around, sticky side out, as tight as possible. It'll probably take both of you to get it nice and snug. Over.
Okay, now -
Okay. Now we've got to make the belt real taut here.
How's that?
Real tight. And then ...
Okay, Joe.
Okay, Jack. Did you have - -
- - Hey, Houston, are you reading?
Jack - -
- - We've got the two belts around the top and the one around the bottom all done.
Okay, fine. The next step now is to anchor that tape, and the way we want you to do that is to cut about a 2-foot length off the roll and then tear it lengthwise so that you have two strips about 2 feet long and about a half an inch wide. And you'll wrap those around the canister at right angles, more or less, to the tape that you've got so that it goes across the top and across the bottom; and when it goes across the top and the bottom, put it so that it's outboard of the center hole and try to get it over one of the ridges between the screens, so that it won't block the flow. Is that clear? Over.
Yes, Joe. Very good.
Okay. Press on.
Okay. I've got a cut length right here and we'll tear it lengthwise ... and I'm going to go around right here at this ridge all the way around at right angles and anchor it ...
Yes.
Joe, just to clarify that, sticky end down. Right? On the tape that I am putting on now?
I didn't quite copy that, Jack. Say again.
Okay. That will be the sticky end down on the container, right?
Oh, that's correct. I forgot to say that. That's right.
... hold that one right here, if I can set it.
Okay, Joe; Aquarius. We've got that done.
Okay, Jack. The next step is to get the EVA cue card and use it to form an arch over the top of the canister; just tuck one short end under one ridge on the top the other one against the ridge on the other side so that it forms a rounded arch over the top of the canister. You see, Jack, what we're going to do is slip the bag over this whole assembly and the cue card will serve to keep the bag from being sucked down against the screen. Over.
Okay. I got the idea.
Okay. And when you've done that, to hold the arch in place, just run a strip of tape across the side of the - that is, across the top of the arch, and anchor it down to the sticky strips along each side.
Okay. I got the idea. Okay. Let me just repeat it here. Take a cue card, form an arch over the top, bringing it under the side here. When we're through, run a piece of tape from the sides across the top of that to anchor to the other side.
That's correct.
Okay. It worked.
The top. ... Across the top.
Looks like you're going to have to cut the cue card slightly.
Doesn't have to be really ... over that the only thing we're ... we can just take the scissors and cut off the edge here. The only thing this does, Jim, is prevent this from being sucked down into the container.
Still going to need some more tape. Cut off the end. Okay. Whack off the bottom. ...
Okay, Joe. We've got that arch built, and it's all taped in securely.
Okay, Jack. The next step is to stop up the bypass hole, which is the hole in the center of the bottom of the canister; we want to stop that up because we don't want to bypass the flow; and I forgot to tell you to get something to stick in that hole. We recommend that you either use a wetwipe, or cut off a piece of sock and stuff it in there, or you could probably even crumble up some tape and use that. Over.
Okay. We'll start plugging up the bypass hole.
Okay.
Plug that hole. We can either - we can put some either - Let's cut a piece of your towel there.
Sounds good.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We have the bypass hole all plugged up.
Okay, Aquarius. The next step is take the inner LCG bag that you cut open, and slip it over the top of the canister, when you do that, orient it so that the ears of the bag, that is, the corners should stick out on the closed end - are oriented along the open ends of the arch, because we're going to snip one of those corners to stick the hose in. Pull it down until it fits snugly over the arch. Over.
Okay, Joe. Slip the bag over the canister so that the arch is at the bottom of the bag and that the ears are along oriented along, let's see - I guess it would be - would be at the sides of the arch.
Depends on what you mean by sides - over the - the open ends of the arch.
Right, the open ends of the arch.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. We've got that done.
Okay. Now press the bag against the sticky belts that we put on the sides of the canister. If there is any excess material, just kind of pleat it, so that it makes a fairly tight seal, and then take another 3-foot strip of sticky tape and wrap it around the outside of the bag opposite the bottom - the bottom sticky belt - to make a nice tight seal.
Okay. I'll do it. Okay. Now they want two strips around here to make a tight seal.
Okay, Joe. We've got the canister inside the bag, two strips around the sides of the bag, real tight, and both sealed.
Okay; real fine. Now there's probably a couple of inches of excess bag sticking our around the bottom of the canister. To prevent this from sucking in against the bottom screen, we'd like you to trim it off with the scissors, and when you've done that, we'd like you to cut two more strips of tape about 12 inches long or so, cut the - tear them lengthwise to get four pieces 12 inches long and 1/2-inch wide, and then use those four strips to secure the bag by passing the strips from the sides of the canister outside the bag around the bottom of the canister and back up the other side, and when you do this, just as you did on the top, make them go outboard of the hole and in between the screens. Over.
Okay. You want me to trim the excess material that's sticking off here; trim it at the edge of that canister? Or do you want any excess left over?
No, you don't need to have any excess. Just trim it approximately level.
Okay. Let's do that first.
Okay.
Okay. Now, Joe, you want to cut four strips, 12 inches long each, 1/2-inch in diameter. Tape that along the outsides of the bag across the ribs.
That's correct, Jack. That's just for additional security on the bag. When you get those done, you'll have - You'll have two strips going one way, and the other two will be perpendicular to them.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We've got the four strips in place.
Okay. We're in business now with the bag, and the next step to perform is to get ready to put the red suit hose, either the commander's or the LMP's because we're - we're going to want you to have both of these made up eventually, into the top of the - of the bag, and to do that you, first of all, have to assure that the - that the red hose is separated from the blue hose. I don't know whether this has been done already, but if it hasn't, what you have to do is cut the outer Beta-cloth sheath down the full length of the - of the hoses and then also cut the rubber ties that secure the two hoses together, and the hoses should come apart and the COMM cable should - should come off. Over.
Okay. Take the  - I'm going to want to separate the red hose from the blue hose by cutting this Beta-cloth sheath. Okay. That's in work.
Okay.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I have the LMP's red hose separated from the others.
Okay. Real fine. Now the next step is to cut a diagonal hole in one ear of the - of the plastic bag near the arch. You can pick either one and cut about, a 1-1/2 or 2 inch diagonal hole, big enough to slip the red hose through. And when you've done that, you'll just slip the red hose through so that it goes about to the center of the canister. It's - it's - It's not critical except that the opening should be down, and then tape the bag to the hose where it goes in so that it's nice and snug. Over.
Okay. Copy that. We want a 1-1/2 inch hole right here at this ear, and put the hose in here, end down and toward the canister and then we tape the seal around here.
Let's try it. We can always make it bigger if we have to. Fred, get those. ... the center of the arch.
Got to - Got to come in towards the center, all the way to the center. No, no.
Yes. I can't get those big knobs.
... All we have to do is ... tape around here ... tight fit. ...
There it is right there.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. Our do-it-yourself lithium hydroxide canister change is complete. Joe, the only thing different is that our arch on this piece of cardboard is not big enough to position the red hose with the inlet down, and the inlet - the inlet to - to the red hose is lying on its side, but I think it'll still work.
Okay, Jack. I concur. I think it'll work, too. There's one step that I omitted, which you can do now quite conveniently, and it's this. Where you stuff the towel in the bypass hole on the bottom, we recommend that you cut a few short pieces of tape and just tape that over so it doesn't fall out. Over.
Okay. Will do. Jim, I've got one more little thing to do, and that's ... seal that top.
Okay, Joe. That's done.
Okay, Jack. Now the remaining steps are simply suit-loop configuration steps to get this thing into full operation, and our ECS people want to hold off on that until the canister you're working on gets to 7.6 millimeters of mercury, which will probably be another 45 minutes or an hour - it - We're reading 4.7 now. So what we'd like you to do in the interim is to set up the second command module canister the same way you just did the first one, using the commander's hose, and get that all set and probably about that time it'll be time to - to switch over. For your information, when you've got that done and if you've had your breakfast and so on, the next thing I've got for you is a switch-configuration list for the command module, which will represent the - the powerdown, square-1 starting configuration for all our - our preentry checks. Over.
Okay. We'll start setting up the commander's hose configuration the same as the LMP's hose. And I'll get - instead of - I guess you want me to use my launch ... - launch checklist which I'd ...
That's affirmative, Jack. What we have done is marked up the lift-off configuration checklist, and we'll run through it whenever you get around to it.
And, I assume that ...
What I'd better do is before I put this thing back in operation, they're going to complete that other canister. I don't know. It should be in operation now. ...
Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
Okay, Joe. Should this canister be in operation now because it's already mounted on the hose?
Well, yes. We haven't completely configured the suit loop to get full flow through there, and it's okay the way it is. What I recommend you do with the commander's hose is get the bag all ready, but not stick the hose in until we call you on it. Okay.
Okay. Will do.
It won't go around?
Yes. Or else a strip of tape.
Okay, Jim. We've got to start setting up the commander's. ...
You can get one of the cards, and I'll start cutting the ... bag.
Yes. ... show. How about that ... because I've got two in my ...
Yes. Here, we'll store them back where I got it.
Hello, Aquarius; Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Jack; Tom here. Just thought I would pass on to you and Jim that got a little data priority going today, and going to convene to CPCB and we'll have you all kinds of good procedures for later on. Over.
Okay. Thank you, Tom. You guys are really working overtime.
We're getting a little coordination down here.
Aquarius, Houston. You might pass on to Jim, he had such a long day yesterday, we thought we were going to have to play him some guitar music to get him to sleep last night. Over.
That's exactly what he did. Tom said you had such a long day yesterday, he thought he was going to have to play some guitar music to get you to sleep.
Okay. Let's get this tape around the outside.
Kind of looks like the Earth has gotten kind of angled a little bit, but it's, for as many hours as ..., I think it's been great. You know how to do this? How? ... the terminator.
Okay. Now we got to get two strips ... tight.
Tom said the CPCB is getting ...
... he's never been through a command module activation.
That looks good. Now we got trim up that extra.
... Well, I don't really - Part of that is - See, Jim, I have the same problem that you have. I can't control pitch very well with my RHC - I have to use the THC and that was the control problem. No, I don't think that there's any control problem. I don't know why, because - Well, you have to ... ... you still have barber pole on the - on the ...
... Oh, wait a minute; I'm sorry I didn't see it. ...
...
... (laughter).
I'll tell you, why don't you put - under your restraining cable; just stow it under your restraining cable there. And that will keep, then, until we're ready for them.
Can I have my juice?
... there's an orange in yours.
Yes, I've got to get the launch checklist. And we're going to go over initial switch configuration. And get all those ...
I kind of have an idea that as soon as we hit darkness, we'll be doing a P51, P52. Hope we're going to be ...
When you get through, you could get me that R - the checklist up in R-3 ...
Okay; Houston; Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Joe, I'm ready to start on that command module switch configuration. That's on page L 1-1.
Okay, Jack. Understand you are ready for the switch configuration checklist. And I have in front of me the lift-off configuration, page L 1-1. Are you with me? Over.

Okay. Real good, Joe. ... configures for that panel.
Okay. You can get those configures when you can. And the next order of business I've got for you is a procedure to verify that MAIN BUS B is good. And a little after that, we'll want to read up to you, for your future information, a procedure for transferring LM power to the command module. Over.
Okay. That sounds good. You want to get this PLSS configuration done first before you give those other procedures, huh?
Yes, I think so. Stand by 1 second and I'll see if FLIGHT has any words for us before you start that.
Jack, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, we don't have anything for you. Our only concern is that you'll wake up somebody; is there anybody sleeping right now?
No. We're all sitting here eating. I'm just going to get a bite to eat. Then I'll write down that switch configuration, or I'll copy the procedure now, if you want.
Yes, okay. Understand they are all up. Did you say you wanted to copy the other procedure now? Over.
I can if you want. It's your choice.
I'd rather you went ahead with the switch configuration, Jack.
Okay, let's do that and then I'll be back with you.
Okay. See you later. And tell Jim that Deke wants him to go to bed.
Okay. I'll tell him that right now.
Okay.
I'll tell you, I'll get my switch set done first before I eat so I won't disturb Jim any.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Stand by 1 minute, Jack, before you go in there. FLIGHT has got one other item for you.
Deke wants you to go to bed.
Right now.
... like that ... I got up about 1 hour ...
You know what I thought - I think what we saw venting was the result of our DELTA-Vs stirring up things, popping the relief valve. Yes. We don't see anything venting now. ...
Okay, Houston. We are standing by.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Okay, Joe.
Okay, Jack. You can go ahead and set up that switch configuration. What we are discussing is having you activate the MAIN BUS TIE motor switches a little later on simply to verify that they will be okay, because the batteries are probably getting a little bit cool. But we'll be back to you with a procedure and discussion about that after you get the switch configuration set up. Over.
Okay, I'm going to go get the switch configuration done now before Jim goes to bed so I don't disturb him.
Okay. Real fine.
Jim thinks Deke sounds like Frank Borman on Apollo 8.
(Laughter) Okay. Sorry about that.
I'm going to give the COMM to Fred-o, now.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, before I hit the sack, Joe, I just want to make sure - How are you still planning an MCC at 107 and what's the latest find?
Okay, Jim. We are still gathering our thoughts on the MCC, but some of the considerations go like this: FIDO tells us that we can do that correction probably as late as 118 hours, with no significant DELTA-V penalty, and with plenty of tracking thereafter to make sure that we've done the right thing, and to set you up for a late MCC if we need it, which we probably wouldn't. We are happy with the PTC mode that you are in now, and, although we are working up a - an AGS PTC mode to use after the midcourse correction, we'd kind of like you to stay in this PTC for a while because it is doing good. We are looking at the weather in the landing area. We don't think we'll have a problem but we are checking it real close, and if there is any changing that we want to do, we want to get it into this midcourse correction. And for reasons like that, we are considering possibly delaying the midcourse correction from 104 hours to some time between there and 118. We'd like to know what you think about it. Over.
We have no druthers. As long as we do the midcourse and there is plenty of tracking thereafter to correct for another midcourse; that's my only concern.
Okay, Jim. Roger that. And based on FIDO's input that he'd like to do it not later than 24 hours before EI, we will be doing it prior to 118 hours.
Okay.
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
Question, Joe. Jim has been talking to me about how we are going to do this midcourse, and awhile back when we went through this power up, we had pulled the STAB/CONTROL ASA breaker. I was wondering - we lost the heaters in the ASA - I was wondering how it looked? What kind of shape it's going to be in?
Okay. Stand by on that one, Fred.
Okay.
Fred, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I am told that we'd see 38 degrees for that package, and it'll be okay for the burn. We're massaging the detail procedures for this burn at this time and we expect to have a real clean setup to you in plenty of time.
Okay, very good.
And I don't know if Jack passed it on to you, but Jack and I just finished logging about 6 hours sleep, each.
Roger, Fred. Copy that. Is it a little chilly up there?
Yes. We made the mistake of putting up the window shades, which we won't do again; and with this powered-down mode, we're not generating much internally, and it really did get chilly.
Yes. I guess you'll have to generate your own heat in there for a while.
Deke says unstow the Exer-Genie.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Fred, just wanted to let you know in advance that we're coming up on the redline CO<sub>2</sub> value for the secondary canister, and we expect to get there in something like a half hour, at which time we'll be asking you to switch over to the command module canisters. I have the rest of that procedure ready and I just wanted to warn you a little bit in advance. Over.
Okay. And I've got a question for you, Joe.
Go ahead.
Okay. The - I need to find out if the condensate container that we were going to use to strain some water in on the lunar surface - is that container also completely airtight? Okay to use it to put fluid in through here in zero g?
Fred, I didn't copy what you wanted to use it for. Over.
...
Fred, Houston. We'll have to stand by for 1 minute. We are in a noisy state of COMM.
Okay. How do you read now, Joe?
Oh, that's much better. Go ahead.
Okay. I was just going to say we haven't had an overboard waste water dump since clear back around the other side of the Moon. About this time, we're running out of the bags we've got on board here.
Okay. I'm - I'm stupid this morning, Fred. I'm not quite sure what you are getting at.
Okay, Joe. We need some place to put the urine.
Okay. It sounds to me as if the suggested receptacle is perfectly satisfactory. Do you think you can use it in its present configuration?
Oh, yes. We got all the innerconnects - hookups we need, but I wasn't sure if that gadget was devised solely with the 1/6g environment in mind, and whether it might leak somehow in zero g.
I'll have them verify that, but off the top of my head, I'm sure it's going to be all right. We'll check it, Fred.
Okay.
Okay. How do you read, Joe?
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Joe. One thing I've noticed, that a couple of circuits there now - the pulse ... - at least the number of them, is markedly decreased, and ... rather bad and, apparently, that added venting we had out of the service module was some overboard relief valve, maybe letting go, because it appears to have stopped now.
Okay, Fred. Copy that. Thank you.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
What do you read down there for partial pressure CO<sub>2</sub>?
Oh, let's see. We're reading 6.6 right now, Fred. What do you read?
I'm reading about 12.5. I guess we've got a gage problem ... I did just get a MASTER ALARM and no caution light; we kind of figured that's what it was, with CO<sub>2</sub> approaching its limit. Maybe it didn't quite come out here.
Okay. Let me get a go, and I think it's time for us to go ahead and put these other canisters on. Stand by 1.
Okay. We went to 15 on the primary last night before I changed it and - -
Roger that, Fred. We wanted to - -
- - I don't have a steady - I don't have a steady ECS light on at this time, Joe, so it must have just been a momentary.
Okay. We know when you went to 15 last night on primary. We want to switch out today at 7.6. Let me check and see if we're ready.
Okay.
Yes. That's what it is, Joe. I've got something going on this alarm ... ECS light.
Fred, Houston. The COMM isn't too sharp and I didn't copy.
Okay, Aquarius; Houston - -
Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?
- - Why don't you try it now? You're loud and clear now, Fred.
Okay. I was just - I'm getting MASTER ALARMS every few seconds and I am catching a glimmer now of the ECS light. For the time being, I have ... - ... open. Okay, now we got the ECS light on steady.
Okay. Copy that. You have the MASTER ALARM, with the ECS light. We are ready to go ahead and get you on the command module canisters. And as the first step, I'd like to know whether you've inserted the commander's red hose to the second canister bag. Over.
Okay. Yes. Sure enough; the commander's red hose is inserted into the canister bag.
Okay, Fred. The next thing I'd like you to do is to take some more gray tape and tape over half the outlet area of each of the blue nozzles; the commander's and the LMP's. The reason we're doing this is we're going to be running this loop through the secondary LiOH canister hole with the canister removed, and we don't have the flow restriction we need to keep the separator from overspeeding. Over.
Okay. Yes, that's right. So we want to tape over half of the - both the blue and the red commander hoses. Is that right?
Negative, Fred. That's half of the commander's blue hose and half of the LMP's blue hose - the outlet hoses.
Oh, okay. I'll tape over half of each of the outlets. Stand by.
Okay.
Okay. I'm going to turn off one suit flow valve at a time while I am doing the taping, Joe.
Say again, please, Fred.
Okay, while I'm doing the taping, I'll have that particular suit flow valve in the suit DISCONNECT position momentarily.
Okay. Fine.
Okay. How do you read now, Joe?
Okay, Fred. Reasonable COMM. Are you ready for the next step? Over.
Okay. One correction - the red hose that's connected up right now to the lithium cartridge in the LMP's - Wait a minute.
Okay, Fred. Understand only the LMP's red hose is actually plugged into the canister bag. In that case, we would like you to follow the procedure for inserting the other red hose in the     other canister bag as follows: you cut a diagonal hole in one corner of the bag. Look at the other bag and see how it was done. Stick the hose in about 6 inches. Try to get the outlet nozzle down if you can, or else sideways, and then just tape up the hose to the bag to make a nice tight seal. Over.
Okay. Jack's back in here. I guess he can do that. Stand by.
Okay.
How do you read, Joe?
Okay, Fred. Is that done? Over.
No. That's still in works. I just wanted to comment you might pass on to Steve Grega, we thank you a lot for those rendezvous procedures. They went to making up these little boxes.
Okay. We appreciate your appreciating it. We're just having a ball down here working on all kinds of new procedures, Fred. The CPCB is in session, and we expect to have your entry procedures out here by Saturday or Sunday at the very latest.
Saturday or Sunday?
At the very latest!
Take your time, Jack.
Why don't you run that other hose back up in the tunnel so Jim can get some air.
Yes. I got it.
And Joe, how you read now?
Satisfactory, Fred. Go ahead.
Okay. Back to the condensate container. I guess the only question I really need answered is will it leak?
Is will it leak? Oh, yes. Stand by 1.
And we've checked all the fittings and I know I can hook everything up to our UCDs. So, if it doesn't leak, we can transfer.
Okay, Fred. We still don't have a final answer on whether or not it'll leak. If you need it, I'd go ahead and use it; and standing by for your completion of the hose-insertion procedure.
Okay. The hose-insertion procedure ... the second cartridge is complete.
Okay. That's complete. The next step is to switch to the primary CO<sub>2</sub> canister and remove the secondary canister and stow it. Over.
Okay. I'm going to have to get off COMM here; I'll let Jack get the headset.
Okay.
Hey, Joe. I'm on the headset now.
Is that secondary? ... secondary?
Both cartridges are out.
Okay, Joe. Fred has the secondary cartridge out. We're back on primary now.
Okay, Jack. The next step is to place the command module canisters with the hoses attached in a suitable location to permit the bottom of the canister to be exposed to free airflow and tape them in place. Ideally, well, it doesn't matter. Just - just pick out your own spot.
Okay. I'm going to tell you where they are. They're both situated, as you say, with the bottom of the canister exposed to free air, and one is sitting right by the - the LMP's is sitting right by the EPS panel, and the CDR's is up in the tunnel.
Jack, Houston. The COMM got real noisy there, and I didn't copy that. Stand by a moment.
Okay, Joe. How do you read now?
Okay. That's real good, Jack; go ahead.
Okay. The canisters are situated as you - as you would like with the bottom of the canister exposed to free air.
Okay.
The position of the LMP's canister - The LMP's canister is sitting on the EPS panel now, and the CDR's canister is positioned up in the tunnel.
Okay. Real fine, Jack. The next step is to physically separate both blue hoses a good distance away from the canister so that we don't short circuit the flow, and tape them in place; and the ideal location for them would be up in the tunnel so as to get some flow into the command module. Over.
Both hoses in the - up into the command module?
Oh, you can use your judgment on that, Jack. We'd like at least one, and the recommendation that I got was to put them both up in the tunnel.
Okay. We have the LMP's blue hose up by the LMP's window and the - Of course, the red hose is separated by some 4 feet. And the - Okay. We're going to - and the other hose - the - has the extension on it - The CDR's blue hose, of course, has the extension on it, and it's blowing way up in the command module. And the red hose is about - Oh, it's right at the docking ring where the blue latches are, so there's about 4 or 5 feet difference from there, too. Is this satisfactory?
Okay, Jack. That sounds satisfactory. The next steps are - are suit-loop configuration steps, and the first one is to - -
Okay. SUIT DIV - -
- - is to place the SUIT DIVERTER valve to the PULL EGRESS position.
Okay. SUIT DIVERTER valve to PULL EGRESS.
That's affirmative - -
That's done - -
Okay. The next step is CABIN GAS RETURN to EGRESS. Over.
...
Okay, Jack. Did you copy CABIN GAS RETURN to EGRESS? Over.
No, I didn't get that, Joe. CABIN GAS RETURN to EGRESS.
That's correct.
Okay. That's done.
Okay. Next, SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF to CLOSE. Over.
SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF to CLOSE.
Roger.
Okay. I got that done.
Okay. And the last step is select secondary CO<sub>2</sub> canister. We'll let it flow through the empty hole, and let's see how we do.
Select secondary CO<sub>2</sub> canister.
Roger, Jack. That completes that procedure, and the next thing I've got for you is a procedure for going back into the command module and powering up the main buses temporarily using the BUS TIE switches. We want to do this for two reasons: first of all, we want it absolutely verified that there are no loads on the main buses, that we've got everything off and that the buses look good; and the second thing we want to do is to power the bus - the main buses, with the BUS TIE motor switches, and then depower them by pulling the circuit breakers, leaving the MAIN BUS TIE switches in the on position, just to assure that they'll be there when we need them, whether the batteries get cold or not. Over.
Okay, Joe. How you read?
Better now, Jack. Satisfactory. Did you copy my rationale for the main bus powerup?
Yes, I did. You want to remove - You want to power up both buses, with the BUS TIE motor switches; first of all, to see that there are no loads on the buses, and second, and then depower the buses by pulling the circuit breakers to insure that the motor switches don't - that the BUS TIES stay on so that they're there when we need them.
That's correct, Jack. Are you ready to copy the procedure?
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. As the first step, I have one change to the basic configuration that we gave you, and it's two more circuit breakers that we want open. On panel 225 - Are you ready to write that down? Over.
Yes. I'm all ready, Joe. Go ahead.
Joe, I'm all ready. Go ahead.
Okay. On panel 225, we want the RENDEZVOUS TRANSPONDER FLIGHT BUS circuit breaker open, and the S-BAND FM TRANSMITTER/DSE FLIGHT BUS circuit breaker open. Over.
Okay. TV RENDEZVOUS TRANSPONDER FLIGHT BUS, open; TV S-BAND TRANSMITTER/DSE FLIGHT BUS open on panel 225.
Okay. That's correct, Jack. And now we'll go into the main bus powerup procedure. And the first step there, is on panel 5. We want the BAT CHARGER BAT A CHARGE circuit breaker closed, and the BAT CHARGER BAT B CHARGE circuit breaker closed. Over.
Okay. That's BAT CHARGER BAT A CHARGE, BAT CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, both closed on panel 5.
That's affirmative. We need them closed to power the switches. Next on panel 5, we want the EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN A and MAIN B circuit breakers closed. Over.
Okay. Panel 5, CB EPS sensor's signals MAIN A and MAIN B closed.
Okay. That's affirmative. We need them closed so that you can read out your volts and amps. Next step, on panel 250, we want circuit breaker BAT A POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING and BAT B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed. Over.
Okay on panel 250, CB BAT A POWER, ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed; BAT B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.
That's affirmative. And at that point, we'd like you to check the BAT bus voltages on both BAT buses to make sure we don't have any shorts. Over.
Okay. Read the BAT bus voltages on BAT BUS A and BAT BUS B.
That's affirmative. The next step on panel 275: circuit breaker MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed, and circuit breaker MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed. Over.
Okay. On 275, circuit breakers MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed; MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed.
That's affirmative. The next step on panel 5: we want the MAIN BUS TIE A/C switch to the BAT A/C position, and verify proper voltage on MAIN BUS A, and read the amps on BAT A to make sure we don't have a short. Over.
Okay. ...
Okay, Jack; Houston. We're in bad COMM again; let's wait a minute.
Okay. How do you read ...?
That's better, Jack. Go ahead with your readback.
Okay. Place MAIN BUS TIE A/C, on, read MAIN BUS A current and voltage.
Okay. That's affirmative. The next step will be the MAIN BUS TIE B/C switch to the on position and read MAIN B voltage and battery B amperage as above. Over.
Okay, MAIN BUS TIE B/C on; read MAIN B voltage and current.
Okay. That is correct. Then to reconfigure from this configuration, Jack, we want you to leave the MAIN BUS TIE switches in the on position and pull the circuit breakers out in reverse order that we had you close them. Over; and do you want me to read them up individually?
No, let me see if I've got it here. I go down to panel 275, open CB MAIN A, BAT BUS A and CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B. Then I go down to 250, and pull CB BAT A POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING and BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING and then up on panel 5, pull EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN A, SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B, BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, BATTERY CHARGER BAT A CHARGE. And then close - I don't know whether you want me to close the RENDEZVOUS RADAR TRANSPONDER FLIGHT BUS and S-BAND TRANSMITTER/DSE FLIGHT BUS.
Okay, Jack. We don't want you to close those last two. Those are changes to your basic configuration, and we want to leave them open for now. Over.
Okay. I'll do that. Was the rest of the readback okay?
That's correct. Readback was 100 percent, and we'll wait to hear from you.
Okay, Joe. And just for confirmation, I went through the switch list you gave me. We are in exactly that configuration with one exception, and that is over on panel 382. I have not, the a - H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATOR is in the OFF position so that if we need any more water, we can get it.
Okay. Roger, Jack. Copy that. On panel 382, you've left the H<sub>2</sub>O ACCUMULATOR valves in the OFF position, and we concur.
Okay. And there's one other thing that I don't know whether you're aware of. We have no lithium hydroxide canisters in panel two fif- in - canisters now. So when we get ready to power up, you'll have to remind us when you want us to add some.
Okay, Jack. We copy that. That's correct, and I'll add that to our basic checklist so that we won't forget it.
Okay. Real fine, Joe, and I'm on my way back into the command module.
Good deal.
Thank you.
How do you read, Joe?
And, Joe, how do you read Aquarius?
Aquarius, Houston. Pretty good. Go ahead.
Okay. I'm back on the line now, but Jack really ... headed back to the upstairs bedroom.
Okay. Roger that, Fred.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, Fred. We recommend that you push your MASTER ALARM circuit breaker in so you'll have audio and visual on that, and, also, we medical types are getting to feel left out down here, and we'd like you to give us BIOMED ... position, if you're plugged in for it, and we'll see whether it affects the voice or not. Over.
Okay.
Hey, Houston; Aquarius. On DOWN VOICE BACKUP S-band, how do you read me?
Aquarius, Houston. Read you now satisfactory.
Okay. And that's my ...
Okay. Thank you very much, Fred.
Actually, a good deal of that little power pack heats up and ...
Roger that.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Jack just ... himself back down. And after he put on the 250 BAT A, BAT B breakers, he read BAT bus volts as 32.3 on A, 37.0 on B; he then punched in the 275 breakers, which tied the batteries to the buses, and at that time he read the A bus volts 32.0 on A, zero amps; 37.0 on B, zero amps.
Aquarius, Houston. The COMM got noisy there, and I want to make sure we get these numbers right, so I'd like to ask you to repeat them ...
Okay. How do you read now, Joe?
Okay; probably okay, Fred. Read it nice and slow so we'll be sure to get it. Over.
Okay. Jack pushed in the 250 BAT A, BAT B entry breakers. He read battery bus volts as 32.3 on A, 37.0 on B. Then he pushed in the 275 breakers tying the BATs to the main buses. In this configuration, MAIN A is at 32.0 volts, zero amps; MAIN B is at 37.0 volts, zero amps. So it looks like the buses are okay.
Okay, Fred. Copy those numbers and thank you very much. I assume you got them off all right.
That's affirm. We got all the breakers pulled again.
Okay. Real fine.
Hey, Houston; Aquarius. How do you read?
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. How did our ... configurations appear to be working down there?
I'm sorry, Fred, but we got noisy again there.
Okay. Let me know when you want me to try it.
Okay. That sounds better already. Go ahead.
Okay. I'd just like to ... how's - how's our lith-o cartridge setup ... appear to be working down there.
We are reading 0.2 on our CO<sub>2</sub> sets here, and we're all delighted. It seems to be working fine.
Boy, that is great.
And Fred, Houston. In a little while here, I'm going to have a procedure that I want to read up to you and have you copy down for future use. It's a procedure for powering the command module main bus off the LM, and it's something that we feel that's going to come in real handy later on for such things as popping off the command module entry batteries, and also possibly for doing some preheating and preliminary powering up of the command module before we get rid of the LM. We'll have that for you in probably 10 or 15 minutes. Over.
Okay, okay, Joe. That's good. Sounds good.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Fred. Our procedure-generating mill has generated another very short one for you here. It's a procedure for getting an onboard read-out - -
Stand by 1, Joe.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. Go ahead.
Okay, Fred. This is a procedure for getting a read-out of the descent propellant tank temps. It's no big problem, but our LM people say that the bottom of the descent stage is probably cooling off, and we just want to verify that the descent water tank will be okay. Right now, it looks as though it won't freeze until several hours after it's empty, but we want to have you read these temperatures out to us so we can see how good our predictions are. The procedure is, on panel 16, close the PROPELLANT DISPLAY/ENGINE OVERRIDE LOGIC circuit breaker. Over.
Okay. The PROPELLANT DISPLAY OVERRIDE circuit breakers are closed. ... the propellant.
Right, Fred. The next step is simply to turn the PROPELLANT TEMP PRESS MONITOR switch to DESCENT 1, read the fuel and OX temps, turn it to DESCENT 2, read the fuel and OX temps; tell us what they are.
Okay. On DESCENT 1, I get a fuel temp of 66.5 degrees, OX ... on DESCENT 2, I get ...
Okay, Fred. We're in noisy COMM here; I got DESCENT 1 fuel 66.5; stand by a second.
Okay. How do you read, now ...?
That's better. Go ahead.
Okay. You got 66.5 on DESCENT 1 fuel temp, oxidizer temp is 66 degrees.
Okay. Copy - -
On DESCENT TANK 2, fuel is reading 60 - Okay. DESCENT 2 fuel is reading 68 degrees; oxidizer, 65 degrees.
Okay. Copy that, Fred. Thank you. We'd like you to pull the circuit breaker, and we'll probably come to you again in 5 or 6 hours for another check.
Okay. The panel 16 ... ... ENGINE ... OVERRIDE is open.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. We're chasing a small glitch that we saw a while ago in the O<sub>2</sub> flow rate which is now normal again, but what we'd like you to do is, first of all, to tell us whether, during that canister procedure, you moved O<sub>2</sub> DEMAND REG A to any position other than CABIN, and then we'd like you to move it to OFF momentarily and back to CABIN for us.
Okay. To answer your question, Joe, it's no. I checked the CABIN all the time. Qualitatively, when we switched to this configuration, it didn't seem like the frequency or the suit fan noise ... decreased ... logged down a little bit, but I'll follow your procedure. You want me to take REG A, go to close and back to CABIN; is that correct?
That's correct, Fred.
Okay. We're in close.
Okay.
Now, I'm back to CABIN.
Okay. Thank you very much, Fred. I'll get back to you if we see anything.
(Music - The Age of Aquarius)
... Thank you.
Hey, have you guys got a woman on board?
No way I could handle that.
And, Joe, do you have the ... out for the ...?
I'm not sure I copied that, Fred. If you asked me whether I had that powerup procedure, I don't have it for you, yet. Over.
No. The question was, do you have a ... from the Moon burn.
Still didn't understand, Fred. I'm sorry.
Okay. We'll be able to get better COMM.
Roger.
Okay.
Fred, Houston. You want to try it, now?
How do you read, Houston?
That's pretty good, Fred.
Okay. Two things: first of all, we noticed a ...
Gol darn it. Just as you started talking, it got noisy again, Fred; try it again.
Okay.
Try it now, loud and slow.
Okay. Jack had a question on how far out from the Moon are we now?
On how far out what?
From the Moon we are now?
Oh. Our little plot shows you just touching the 180-thousand-mile line. So you're about 40 K out from the Moon.
Okay. Okay. And the other thing is, we've noticed some fresh new particles floating around outside, so possibly the service module is starting to vent a little bit again.
Okay. Copy that, Fred. On the O<sub>2</sub> flow thing, we clearly saw the DEMAND REGULATOR go to OFF and back to CABIN. TELMU thinks that it's no big thing that you've seen a little change in flow due to the different resistance we've got in the circuit.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Fred. Recommend you go to OFF on the BIOMED switch. We never did get any BIOMED and it might clear up the COMM a little bit.
Okay. How you read now?
Okay, Fred. That might be a little better.
We're on the 180 - K line, right now.
...?
We're about 40 050.
... It's 550 over there.
Okay. It's ... there.
Just split the difference.
Yes.
Okay. I got a copy of the ... K ...
Is that right?
EECOM.
That midcourse should be interesting. You know, the mode we're going to do it in.
Manual AGS ... DPS burn. We're controlling ... TTCA attitude. ...
... down under ...
Fortunately.
We can't help them too much. Actually it isn't bad ... but ... ... goddamned unfortunate. In part, I get a feeling ... now when I get ... Just before ... goes to zero in 1 second I'm going to pull them out ...
Another burn that's never been done.
Go to the - Go to the technique for a lash and ... it's the burn technique.
I'm sure they got something written out, maybe ...
A what?
Well, hell, Jack. All you - you don't use a very good one ... Just if you'll go ... at your attitude reference for ... and the g-meter backup. Because, really, you can almost ... The command module and your odds are 60 to 40 that you're going to hit Earth blunt-end first, without any reference.
... I didn't realize that. That proves you've got a little bit above 50-percent odds that you're going to enter blunt end, and -
We made an entry like that in Apollo 8 in a ... with Houston, ol' Buzz went and turned on the command module heaters and left them on. The activators, they went, "Shooo!" both tanks; we had no gas. Just had a real slow rate ... We actually went out in the console and started debriefing, but left it running and watched it; and the son of a bitch did a hop-skipout, a hopout, underneath ..., but not much, and then we did a long hop ... but - The second reentry, also, it did one ... both times. It lucked out twice and made a real peculiar ... They went to zero g ...
Yes.
Yes, we did, Jack. ...
... But we're in this wobble.
... pass ... then it'll come back down.
Hey, Aquarius; Houston. How do you read me?
Aquarius, Houston. Okay. Go ahead.
Okay, Joe. It - Our wobble in this PTC has picked up where the Moon is running by pretty high in the window and the Earth pretty low; so I expect - On the side where the Moon's present, we're having a little bit of trouble with the COMM ... breakout there in a couple of places.
Okay. Roger that, Fred.
... pressure gage as far as the noise ... get the thing from the AFT. ...
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
Okay, Joe. I'm all set to copy that procedure for powering up the command module from the LM, whenever you want to give it to me. When did you, I guess you want to put battery A out of the CHARGE, huh?
Jack, we're not certain when the best time is to implement this procedure, and what we want to do at this time is read it up to you, so you'll have it and understand it and we'll - We'll be able to do it quickly when the time comes. And I don't have it for you quite yet. Over.
(Laughter) Okay. All right. I'll be standing by to copy it whenever you get it.
Okay, Jack.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Joe, I got to switch antennas here. Okay, Joe, I read you on the FORWARD antenna.
Okay, Jack, I have the procedure now to read up to you. Before I do, I want to mention something that will be of interest to Fred. We are looking at the SHe tank pressure rise and we expect it to blow. We don't know exactly what time it will go, somewhere around 105 hours or perhaps later than that. We've got plenty of blowdown capability. We just thought you ought to be informed.
Okay. Stand by. I'll tell him, now.
Okay.
Fred, they said they're looking at the SHe tank pressure rise, and they expect it to blow somewhere around 105 hours ... Okay. Fred thought they did. ...
Okay. Real fine. Are you ready for the procedure, now, Jack?
Yes. Joe, how long is it? Is it a big long one, or a short one, or a medium sized ... about how many pages?
It's about - I'd say 15 to 20 steps, Jack. Some of it is LM stuff, and the rest of it is in CSM.
Okay. I got a fresh page here, and I'm ready to copy.
Okay. I'll give you the LM steps first. They have to be done first, and the first step is on panels 11 and 16, circuit breakers ASCENT CA, ASC ECA, two to close.
Okay. Panels 11 and 16 CBs ASCENT ECA to closed.
Okay. Next step: panels 11 and 16 CB ASCENT ECA CONTROL, two, to close. Over.
Okay. On 11 and 16 CBs ASCENT ECA CONTROLs to close.
Okay. That's correct. The next step is BAT 5 and 6 NORMAL FEED to high; those are switches.
Okay. BATs 5 and 6 NORMAL FEED, ON.
That's correct. Next step: BATs 1 and 3 to OFF slash RESET. Over.
BATs 1 and 3 to OFF slash RESET.
That's correct. Next step: wait 30 minutes for preconditioning.
Okay. That's wait 30 minutes for preconditioning.
That's correct, and the last LM step for now is BATs 2 and 4 to OFF/RESET.
Okay. BATs 2 and 4 to OFF/RESET.
That's correct. Now we'll go to the CSM, and the first step there is connect LM/CSM umbilical. Over.
Okay. Connect LM/CSM umbilical.
Okay. The next step, on panel 5, CB LM POWER-1 MAIN B and LM POWER-2 MAIN B, both, closed. Over.
Okay. On panel 5, CB LM POWER-1 MAIN B and 2 MAIN B, both, closed.
That's correct. On panel 5, CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B to close. Over.
EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B closed on panel 5.
That's correct. Next step, panel 250: CB BAT C POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING; closed. Over.
Okay. On panel 250: CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, closed.
That's Charlie. Verify MAIN BUS voltage; then, LM POWER switch on panel 2 to CSM. Over.
Okay. That's verify the MAIN BUS voltage, and switch LM POWER to CSM.
Okay. That's correct. Then go back to 275, CB MAIN B BAT BUS B to open. Hey, Jack, that's the step I skipped for you, I'm afraid. Before verifying MAIN BUS voltage, you have to, on panel 275, close CB MAIN B BAT BUS B. Over.
Okay, Joe. How are you reading on the AFT OMNI.
You're okay now. Go ahead.
Okay. After putting the BATTERY B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING on, then I want to push the - on panel 275 MAIN B to BAT BUS B in, huh?
That's right. Then you go to verify MAIN BUS voltage, LM POWER to CSM, and then, on panel 275, circuit breaker MAIN B BAT BUS B to open. Over.
Okay. After verifying the MAIN BUS voltage connecting the LM POWER to CSM I want to pull MAIN B BAT BUS B, or MAIN B to BAT BUS B, open.
That's correct. And then on panel 250, circuit breaker BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to open, and verify MAIN BUS B voltage.
Okay. Panel 250 BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, open, and then verify the MAIN BUS voltage.
Okay. That's correct. The last steps are to get the LM back on descent batteries. The first step is BATs 1, 2, 3, and 4, HI VOLTAGE, ON. Over.
Okay. Then the next step is a LM step, BATs 1, 2, 3, and 4, HI VOLTAGE, ON.
That's correct; and the last step in the LM, BATs 5 and 6 to OFF. Over.
Say again; you cut out there, Joe.
Okay, Jack. The last step in the LM, BATTERIES 5 and 6 to OFF. Over.
Okay. BATs 5 and 6 go OFF.
That's correct. That should configure you. Note that circuit-breaker protection on that circuit limits the available current to 15 amps. We think we can do quite a bit with it though. And the LM/CSM umbilical will be hot and MAIN BUS voltage may be monitored by selecting MAIN B on the gage. Over.
Okay. Real fine.
Good deal, Jack.
Okay. And I'll be ready to implement this whenever you call it up.
Roger that.
And how do you read, Joe?
Pretty good, Fred.
Okay. While Jack was on COMM, I was looking out the docking window here, and I could see another good shower of particles coming out of the service module. And the position this time appears to be on the other side. Before, we'd always seen them out of window 1, and where I'm looking at it from here, it looks like it'd be down below window 6 somewhere in the service module. Jack's going upstairs to see what it looks like up there.
Okay. Good deal. We copy that, Fred. And to show you how relaxed we are about the entry, Ken is looking at - giving you guys a chance to - prior to going into entry, PREP to snap a few pictures of the service module.
Ken is, huh? (Laughter)
Yes, he's got all that film up there, and he doesn't want to waste it.
Oh, I thought maybe you'd want me to do a PLSS EVA to go shoot pictures or something.
Okay, okay.
You're right; we got a lot of pictures.
I guess I agree it surely would be nice to document it someway if we can, but it doesn't look like ...
Yes, we think it'd be a lot of help.
Joe, how do you read me?
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. The condensate transfer worked great.
Stand by a minute, Fred. We're in a bad COMM mode.
Okay. How's that?
That's better.
Okay. The waste transfer into the condensate can works real well, Joe.
Okay. Good deal.
So, I guess we can keep FIDO happy with no overboard dumps.
Roger that.
Yes, that brings up one more possibility, Joe.
Say again, Fred.
Brings up another possibility. Now that we've got all of that stowed into the bags and the condensate can, we could probably blow all of that through the PLSS ..., I wonder how the sublimator would work on waste water.
It might work if we had to do it, Fred. Right now we're looking at a comfortable excess of water through the sublimator. We were talking among ourselves this morning about having you try out the PLSS to ascent tank water-transfer situation and we decided not to do it, not to recommend it, because we figure it'd take us 30 hours to empty one of the ascent tanks, which you have to do in order to get PLSS water to it, and we'd rather use the descent water and we don't think we've gotten any sweat. Over.
Okay, Joe. I don't think there's any question about it from the plumbing standpoint that we could do that if we had to.
Okay. Copy that.
And, how do you read, Joe?
Read you pretty good, Fred. Go ahead.
I think our PTC wobble is growing worse. The Earth now is really up to the top of the window. I have to get way down almost to the floorboards to view it. Conversely, the Moon is way down at the bottom of the window.
Okay.
A lot more wobble.
Roger - -
Far more wobble than I noticed on my previous watch.
Okay. Copied that, Fred. And our thermal people will be looking at it. One of the things we're talking about relative to the midcourse correction is we'd like not to do it before the SHe tank goes, if it's going to go, just so it won't give us a problem reestablishing PTC. And right now our people think that the burst disk will pop around 106 hours.
Okay.
The L-shaped bag is ...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, Fred. Since you went ahead and used the PLSS condensate container, we got the procedure in for using it. I'm not going to read it up to you except that it cautions a little bit about shaking it too much or about filling it too full, because they feel that if you do that the vent valve might unseat and the bag might leak a little bit. Over.
Okay. We haven't removed it from its stowage spot. We just left it right in place, and just - he mated the tank at the end of the cable and hooked right into that.
Understand. That's satisfactory and recommended that you leave it in the stowage spot. That should help the situation.
Roger.
We got a - we got another flow shower going on outside. Particles, seeing them vented against the service module. Jack thinks it may be an H<sub>2</sub> vent. ...
Okay. Copy that. What window are you looking at it out of, Fred?
Out the LM docking window.
The docking window. Roger that. Somebody just handed me your latest consumables status report, and you're using between 11 to 12 amps an hour real steady, and it looks real good.
Roger.
Joe, what are you showing for GET now?
I think you wanted the GET, Jack, and the present GET is 96 hours 21 minutes. Over.
Okay, thank you.
Okay.
And Jack, Houston. For your information, FIDO tells me that we are in the Earth's sphere of influence and we're starting to accelerate.
I thought it was about time we crossed. Thank you.
Roger.
We're on our way back home.
There's something that puzzles me, Joe. Vance mentioned yesterday that the planned entry is a CMC-guided entry, so I'm kind of curious as how are we going to get the alinement.
Did you say how we're going to get guidance? Over.
No. How are we going to get a platform alinement?
Okay. We got a number of interesting ideas on that and the latest one I've heard is to power up the LM platform and aline it, and aline the CM platform to it.
Okay. That sounds good.
Okay. And we're working out detailed procedures on that, Jack.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. We are taking our final look at the mid-course procedures and we have a question as to the present position of one of the switches. The switch is the AGS STATUS switch on panel 6. We'd just like to know where it's at.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay, Joe. The AGS STATUS switch is OFF.
Okay. OFF. Thank you.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay, Vance. I just heard a little thump, sounded like down in the descent stage, and I saw a new shower of snow flakes come up that looked like they were emitted from down that way. We've already decided though - I wonder what the SUPERCRIT pressure looked like now.
Okay. Understand you saw a thump in the descent stage and a few snow flakes. We'll take a look down here, see if we see anything.
Aquarius, Houston.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Fred, we don't see anything wrong. For example, your SHe appears to be okay as far as we can see. The thing we don't have data on, is the ... tank down there.
Okay. And I doubt if it would have been that anyway.
Okay. While we have you on the horn - -
We're still getting -
Roger. Still getting it.
Go ahead.
While you're on the horn, be advised our calculations show you might be running out of potable water in the CSM pretty soon. Also, that you might start to have hydrogen tank venting in the CSM and a question. Next time Jack looks through the sextant and telescope, we'd like him to see how it looks. Do you have anything on the optics, any specks or anything?
Okay, ...
Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?
Aquarius, we read you 4 by 4. Go ahead.
Okay. It looks like the PTC is deteriorated enough that ... the docking window of the LM, and ...
Aquarius, Houston. We got part of your transmission. Understand the PTC has deteriorated quite a bit and you'd like to know what to do about it. Is that affirm?
Negative. How do you read now, Vance?
Okay. A little better.
Okay. The only comment was that it has deteriorated to where the Moon is now coming through the overhead docking window now, in a portion of each pass, and about that time I just lose COMM on either antenna, so there's going to be a short period of time on each revolution where we're not going to have COMM.
Okay, Fred. We understand that and one more item for clarification on the water. We don't really know what your usage of potable is. That was purely an estimate assuming a fairly healthy usage.
Okay.
Hey, Houston; Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. Jack just took a look through the optics - through one REV, and he said they look good, loud and clear. He doesn't have any current condensate on either the sextant or telescope.
Okay, Fred. Thanks for the info.
How do you read, Vance?
Okay. I'm reading you weakly, Fred. Go ahead.
With all this other procedures you've been working on there, I thought I was going to have a new one for you. How to get four gingerbread cubes apart; I think they were stuck together with epoxy.
This is in the food bag?
Yes.
That's to stand loads of launch and boost.
Roger. Tool B did the trick.
Yes.
Hey, Fred. John says you can use the dikes on it to get them apart.
Yes, that probably wouldn't have crumbled them as badly.
I generally don't use the subtle approach. You can tell we're feeling pretty good, Vance, when we start complaining about the food.
Yes. That's good to hear.
I think everybody's feeling better down here, too.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Fred, we have you on the Goldstone big dish now, and our COMM is much better. If you'd like would you turn the BIOMED switch on to either crewman there.
Okay. Stand by. I'll have to plug in first.
Okay.
Okay, Vance. How do you read on baseband.
We read you just - Stand by.
Okay, Fred. We're receiving your MED data; it was a little slow in coming in.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius. Are you calling?
Negative. No call from here.
Okay.
And, Vance, this is Aquarius.
Go ahead, Fred.
Okay. Jim's coming back on the line, and I'll be unhooking on the BIOMEDs, and you want us to go back to the SPA DOWN VOICE BACKUP?
Stand by.
Okay. Jim doesn't have his BIOMED rigged on right now, so ... DOWN VOICE ...
Okay, Fred. You're too weak on that last. I understand you're disconnecting, and your BIOMED will be off. Say again about Jim, please.
Okay. How do you read now?
Okay.
Okay. All I said was Jim doesn't have his BIOMED rigged right now so I'll go back to DOWN VOICE BACKUP SPA and Jim's coming on the line.
Okay. We copy you're in DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
Well, I'm thinking about the last 10 hours. We've lost our suit compressors.
Because we don't want to use the power.
Well, that's what I'm saying. We can use these fans right here and use the circulate air right through the use of those fans.
Are we on mike now?
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Roger, Jim. Good morning.
Good morning, Vance. How's things going down there?
Oh, quiet and smooth.
Oh, it's afternoon down there.
Right. We thought maybe it was morning to you.
Well, I've sort of lost track. But I had a good sleep.
Glad to hear it. Doctor just said he wondered how many hours?
Oh, let's say whenever I left Jack, and Fred came up and we ate for about an hour, and then I went to bed, so whatever that time was. It must be about 5 hours, something like that; 4 or 5 hours.
Good. Glad to see you catching up.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Jim, the next time that it's convenient, could you get the readout of the REPRESS package in the command module for us? Over.
Will do.
Okay.
When you go back there, Fred, they want the REPRESS package readout.
We don't want you to wake anyone up to get it.
No. No one's asleep now.
It has? ..., was it? ... you get forward to it and a pretty good view of the venting.
And, Houston, Aquarius. It looks like service module venting has ceased, at least momentarily.
Roger. Understand service module venting has ceased momentarily. How about the descent stage? Does Fred report venting down there? Do you still see that?
Stand by.
What is your report on descent stage venting - Was it venting? Anything else going on? Any more venting?
No.
No. Fred hasn't seen anything else from the descent stage. And I understand that we can expect the - the SHe - tank pressure to build up to relief here about 105 hours.
Roger. A little later than that - like 106 - 107.
Okay.
Did you get some interior photos?
Yes.
Okay. I'd like to show them the arrangement of these hydroxide canisters. Do you have?
Aquarius, Houston.
Did they give Jack any more procedures on command module powerup?
...
Did they give Jack any more procedures on command module powerup?
Well, they think it might be up here.
Okay.
The main thing we got to think about, and when we have to get to them, is the procedures for LM jettison, the transfer of the LM to CSM mode (cough), LM jettison.
...
Yes.
... the LM mode?
All we have to do is turn the BIOMED ... on, and we'll be in there.
Houston, Aquarius.
Roger. Go ahead, Aquarius.
We would like permission to turn the BIOMED on to get off the hot mike mode. I don't think that we have to be on it now if you have the big dish on, do you?
Yes. Yaw's coming - or roll's coming up for it, and we were going to burn.
Roger, Jim. We concur. Go ahead and turn it on.
Okay. Fine; thank you.
One other point. The philosophy of timing this midcourse is based a little bit on doing it just before the SHe tank is supposed to vent. That way, we hope that we would have - - be powered up and you would have control when the venting occurs, in case you were tossed around a little bit. Over.
Okay. Understand. Philosophy on the midcourse is doing it prior to venting of the SHe tank, which means we'll be doing this around 105 hours, I suppose, or 105:30 and so I'll have control of the spacecraft if it should give us some perturbation.
Roger. Then, after that, we would establish PTC again.
Roger.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Our REPRESS package pressure is 820.
Okay. REPRESS pressure 820. Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, could you switch your BIOMED switch to the position opposite to where it is now? We are getting a subcarrier, but no data. Over.
Now you know, Houston, I don't have BIOMED on.
Okay. And we have a small addition to the procedure that was read up to you earlier, which involves power transfer from the LM to the CSM.
Stand by 1.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. At the end of the procedure, after the step BAT 5 and 6, OFF, add the following: circuit breakers, panels - panels 11 and 16, ASCENT ECA CONTROL, both open. Over.
Okay. After the step BAT 5 and 6, OFF, step 3 will be circuit breakers panels 11 and 16 ASCENT ECA CONTROL, both open.
That's correct, Jim. And this is to guard against a single-point failure that - a remote possibility that would preclude you from getting the batteries back on.
Roger.
Go ahead.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
Okay. We just had a battery warning ... Battery 2.
Stand by, Jim. The COMM's no good here right now.
Houston, Aquarius. How do you read now?
Go ahead. Loud and clear.
Okay. We just had a battery warning MASTER ALARM, and it looks like it's battery 2.
Roger.
Roger, Houston - This is Houston. Could you close the POWER AMP circuit breaker, and we'll get some high bit rate?
Roger.
It's closed.
Okay. And we need high bit rate.
Are you picking it up, Houston?
Roger. And we want to open the BAL LOAD CROSS TIE on panel 16. Over.
Say again.
Open the BAL LOAD CROSS TIE breaker on panel 16. Over.
Open BALANCE LOAD CROSS TIE breaker on 16. Roger.
That's affirm.
It's open.
If you're getting high bit data, we could do an OFF/RESET and go back on on battery 2. We're standing by for that.
Okay. Could you turn off battery 2, and leave it off and let us look at it?
Say again. You want us to turn off battery 2, and leave it off until you look at it?
That's affirmative.
Okay. Battery 2 coming off the line.
Okay, Aquarius. So you want to stay in this configuration for awhile, and let's look at the battery.
Roger. We'll stay in this configuration.
Want to close the BAL LOADS circuit breaker back now.
13, Houston. We want to close the BAL LOADS circuit breaker on panel 16 now, again.
We have it closed; the closed - BALANCE LOADS circuit breaker is closed.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. Request RANGE FUNCTIONS switch to RANGE ...
All right. RANGE FUNCTIONS switch going to RANGE.
Right-o.
Aquarius, Houston.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, on the battery problem, we have determined that it is not overcurrent or reverse current. We suspect it's over-temp, but don't know for sure, so we're going to watch it for awhile.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, Charlie has some procedures to read up for you here; I think you'll need your activation checklist, if it's handy.
Aquarius, that's the contingency checklist.
Okay. I'll just - Okay. Stand by, Charlie.
Okay, Charlie. I've got the contingency checklist, and standing by.
Okay, Jim. We'd like you to turn to page - page 24, which is the "30-Minute Activation," and this is going to be a procedure for the mid-course burn that we got coming up at 105 with the AGS up. Over.
Roger. On the midcourse at 105, and I'm on page 24.
Okay; "30-Minute Activation," omit steps 1, 2, and 3; perform step 4, "RCS system A/B-2." Over.
Roger. Omit steps 1, 2, and 3; perform step 4.
Roger. And on the "EPS Activation," same page, perform step 1; and in step 2, perform line number - line number 6, "EPS DISPLAY-CLOSE." Over.
Okay. On "EPS Activation," perform step 1, and perform step 2, line 6 only; is that correct?
That's affirmative, Jim. The rest of the stuff is already closed at this time, so that's all we'll have to do is close the EPS DISPLAY breaker.
Okay.
All right. Turn to page 25. On page 25, omit step 3; perform step 4. On step 4, last line, scratch "CB(16) EPS: INVERTER 2, closed." Over.
Roger. Omit step 3; perform step 4, except for the last line. Circuit breaker 16, EPS INVERTER 2, closed.
Roger. That's correct. On step 5, perform step 5. Under "Primary Glycol Loop Activation," step 1, line 1, "CB(16) ECS: DISPLAY - CLOSE." That's a crew option; you can have it if you want to. Omit the rest of step 1 and step 2. Perform step 3. Over.
Okay. On primary glycol loop activation, crew option on step 1, first line; the rest of it we'll omit. Step 2, we'll omit, and we'll do step 3.
That's affirmative, Jim, with the following DELTAs on step 3, and if you'll turn to page 26, I'll give you the DELTAs on the activation circuit breaker list. Over.
Okay. I'm there.
Roger. On line 1, correction, row 1, under AC BUS A: TAPE RECORDER should be open; DECA GIMBAL, open. All the other ones as shown on the page. Over.
Okay. On row 1, AC BUS A: TAPE RECORDER and DECA GIMBAL will be open. All the rest as shown.
Roger. And we don't know the status of your windows. If you - During this burn, we're going to have to look out the forward window to get the alinement with the COAS, so you might need the commander window heater and you can, of course, use that breaker if needed, since we do have the AC power. On row 2 - Go ahead. Over.
I don't think we'll need it, Charlie.
Okay; fine, Jim. On row 2, under RCS SYSTEM A: ASCENT FEED 2 and ASCENT FEED 1 should be open. Under FLIGHT DISPLAYS: MISSION TIMER should be open; GASTA, open; ORDEAL, open. Under AC BUS A: GASTA, open. The rest are as shown on the page. Over.
Okay. On row 2, we're going to open up ASCENT FEED 2 and ASCENT FEED 1 under RCS SYSTEM A. We're going to open up the MISSION TIMER, and FLIGHT DISPLAYS: the GASTA and the ORDEAL; and the AC BUS A: the GASTA.
That's affirmative. Okay. Row 3, under PROPELLANT: DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT should be open. Under HEATERS: RENDEZVOUS RADAR STANDBY, open; LANDING RADAR, open. Under STAB/CONTROL: ATCA (PGNS), open. Under ED and LIGHTING: all four open. Over.
Okay. Row 3, under PROPELLANT - propulsion: the DESCENT HELIUM REG/VENT will be open: the STANDBY RENDEZVOUS HEATER will be open and the LANDING RADAR HEATER circuit breaker will be open. I just changed antennas; and, keeping on down the line, ATCA PGNS will be open and the last four circuit breakers, two under ED and two under LIGHTING, will be open.
That's affirmative. Okay. Under row 4, under ECS: GLYCOL PUMP AUTO TRANSFER, close. Under COMM: UP DATA LINK, open; VHF B and VHF A should be open. Under PGNS: LGC/DSKY, open; IMU OPERATE, open. Over.
Okay. Under row 4, the AUTO TRANSFER will be close. UPDATA LINK, open; VHF A and B, open; DSKY, open; and IMU OPERATE, open.
That's affirm. On the last row, the only DELTA is under the CROSS TIE BUS and it should be open. Over.
Say that again, Charlie.
Okay. Under the last row, under EPS is the only DELTA and that is under the CROSS TIE BUS. It should go open. Over.
Roger. The CROSS TIE BUS should go open.
That's affirm. Going on to page 27, Activation, panel 16. Under RCS SYSTEM Bravo: ASCENT FEED 1, ASCENT FEED 2 should be open. Under PROPULSION: PQGS should be open; ASCENT HELIUM REG, open. Over.
Okay. Line 1, on panel 16, ASCENT FEEDs 1 and 2 will be open. And the PQGS will be open, and the ASCENT HELIUM REG will be open.
That's affirmative. On the next three rows, we only get the nine DELTAs, so I'll go through the next three rows completely and then you can read those back. Under LIGHTING - -
Okay.
Under LIGHTING; FLOOD, open; TRACK, open. Under ED LOGIC - Correction, under ED: LOGIC, open. Under STAB/CONTROL: DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE, open. Under ECS: SUIT FLOW CONTROL, open. Under row 3, COMM: DISPLAY, open; VHF A TRANSMITTER, open; VHF B RECEIVER, open. Under ECS: DISPLAY, that's crew option. Last row, under EPS: INVERTER 2, open. Over.
Okay. On the last three rows, we have FLOOD and TRACK circuit breakers, row 2, open; LOGIC POWER B, open; DESCENT ENGINE OVERRIDE, open; SUIT FLOW CONTROL, open. On the third row - row, DISPLAY, open; VHF A and - VHF - VHF A TRANSMITTER, open; VHF B RECEIVER, open. And under ECS: we have DISPLAY, open, at crew option. And the last one, INVERTER 2 under EPS, will be open.
Roger. That's a good readback. Under that ECS DISPLAY, it shows it closed. If, with it closed, you can have some readout of - onboard readout of your ECS system - draws a lot less than a half amp so it's up to you whether you want it or not. Okay, on page 28.
Roger.
On page 28, step - perform step 4 with the following changes in the warning light status. Under the warning lights, you will probably - you will have ASCENT PRESSURE and an LGC light. Scratch "RCS A and RCS B REG." Under caution lights, you'll have a PRE AMPS light. Over.
Roger. Under warning, we'll have ASCENT PRESSURE and LGC; and under caution, we'll have a PRE AMP.
Affirmative. Under "VHF/S-band Activation and Checkout," scratch step 1. Under step 2, change "DOWN VOICE BACKUP" to VOICE. Scratch step 3. Under "PGNS turn on," scratch entire procedure. Under "DAP Set/Gimbal Drive," scratch entire procedure. Over.
Okay. Under "VHF/S-band Activation and Checkout," scratch step 1. Do step 2 with the following change, "DOWN VOICE BACKUP" to "VOICE." Scratch step 3. Scratch the entire remaining events that page. Over.
That's affirmative, Jim, Going on to page 29. We've got - At this point, there's a write-in required. It's about a six or seven liner, and I'll try to go fairly slowly and let you write it down, if you're ready to copy. Over.
Ready to copy.
Okay. At this point, we'd like you to "Verify RCS heaters in AUTO for 15 minutes."
Is that the first step, Charlie?
That's affirmative. What we're trying to do here is we're getting you set up in an attitude so you can damp your rates and come out of PTC. And this is the configuration I'm reading you now, the next - in the next six lines, the procedure for getting you into a configuration to damp the rates and stop PTC. Over.
Okay. So the first thing will be to - "Go to AUTO on the RCS SYSTEM A and B"?
It's the "Verify that the heaters have been in AUTO for 15 minutes." Back on the first page of this procedure, you put the heaters in AUTO and you pushed the breakers in, and we'd like for them to warm up the quads for 15 minutes before we start to - stop at - stopping PTC. Over.
Roger, "Verify heaters RCS on for 15 minutes."
Okay. Step 2: "BALANCE COUPLE, OFF; DEAD BAND, MINIMUM; ATTITUDE CONTROL: PITCH and ROLL to PULSE; YAW to DIRECT; MODE CONTROL: AGS, ATT HOLD; GUIDANCE CONTROL to ACS; damp rates; pitch and roll with the TTCA, yaw with the ACA with the Earth in the front window." Over.
Okay, let's see if I got it. Step 2 is "BALANCE COUPLE's OFF; DEAD BAND, MIN; ATTITUDE CONTROL: PITCH and YAW at PULSE; YAW, DIRECT. MODE CONTROL will be in AGS, ATT HOLD; GUIDANCE CONTROL will be in AGS; we'll damp the rates; pitch and roll with the TTCA, and yaw with the ACA; and we'll probably have to have some reference point, so I have to try and stop on the Earth." Over.
Roger, Jim. We were hoping that in your PTC that you occasionally see the Earth coming through the window; and, if that's true, then we'd like you to have to - just damp the rates with the Earth in the forward window. And then we'll give you the burn attitude via the forward window on the Earth momentarily. Over.
Roger.
Okay. That was the entire procedure for damping the rates, only - though I only gave you - said it was step 2, that was the entire procedure. Now, continuing on to what's printed on page 29 - Correction, you had one error in the readback under ATTITUDE CONTROL. It was PITCH and ROLL to PULSE; YAW to DIRECT. Continuing on, on page 29 with the printed procedure, the first four lines, scratch. Step 3, scratch. Under "AGS Activation," one change: add a step. First step will be "Verify ASA CB(16) in for 10 minutes." The rest of the AGS activation is as printed. Over.
Okay. "Verify ASA circuit breaker 16 in for 10 minutes"; and, I take it, 10 minutes back in our procedures we'll have a note saying to put that in.
It's - the circuit breaker goes in on the circuit breaker activation page, Jim. So, by the time we get here and have the rates all damped, we feel that - that the PIPAS will be up to temperature by this time, and we can go ahead and turn it - turn the AGS on at this time. Over. But we just want you to verify that.
Okay. And one other question, Charlie. I'd like to know if the note you gave me about damping the rates is before the other information on page 29.
That's affirmative. Add that in to the top of the page. The - What we're really doing - Let's - let's put it in to right before the "AGS Activation." The other - the other procedure on the top of the page belongs with the "DAP Set Gimbal Trim," and we're just omitting all of that procedure. So the addition that - on the damping, the rates should really go in right before the "AGS Activation." Over.
Understand.
What we're really trying to do is get you in a posture so that when you see the Earth come through the window, you can damp her out and hold - hold the Earth in the window. Proceeding on to the rest of page 29, under "RCS PRESS," scratch the entire three steps as printed. On page 30, scratch step 4 under the "RCS PRESS." Over.
Roger. Under "AGS Activation," well, I included that step on the ASA circuit breaker and we'll do step 1 and 2 under "AGS Activation." But then we'll scratch steps 1, 2, and 3 under "RCS PRESS" and, on page 30, we'll scratch step 4.
Affirm. Under "DPS PRESS," step 1, line 1, scratch. Line 4, "DESCENT HELIUM REG 1, talkback barber pole." Under step 2, scratch; step 3, scratch; "LANDING GEAR DEPLOY," scratch. Over.
Okay. Under "DPS PRESS," we'll scratch the first line and we'll have the "DESCENT HELIUM REG, talkback to barber pole." We'll scratch steps 2 and 3, and we'll scratch the "LANDING GEAR DEPLOY."
Roger. Now we got, on the back of page 30, Jim, you've got a blank page in your checklist, or should have, and we'd like to add a procedure to get you to burn attitude. Over.
Okay. A procedure to get the burn attitude.
Okay. First statement is a statement: "Verify AGS in OPERATE for 5 minutes." Then we go to "AGS address 400 plus 5, then 400 plus zero. ATTITUDE CONTROL: PITCH and ROLL to PULSE; YAW, MODE CONTROL. Maneuver using TTCA pitch and roll." The computer is controlling yaw, but you can override with ACA. You with me? Over.
Okay, Charlie. I'm with you so far.
Okay, Jim. "When in attitude, ACA out of detent to zero error needle. Then set EVENT TIMER," and we'll give you a countdown on that when you get to that step. Over.
Okay. "When in attitude, ACA out of detent to null needles, and set DET."
Roger. Now, that - the burn attitude will be coming up on a pad, but, basically, we're looking for a local horizontal retrograde burn, which means, using a COAS, if you put the horizontal line on the COAS on the horns of the Earth and then roll to place the X-axis in the direction of the Sun, we'll - that will put us in both burn attitude; and you can check that via the Sun which will be in the AOT detent 2. Should lie right along the cursor at the top. We'll have some more words on that for you momentarily. Now, I'd like to go on to page 31 if you're ready. Over.
Okay. I figure I have a handle on the attitude, the way the Earth should look in the COAS, and you're going to give me some words on what the Sun would look like in the AOT. Is that right?
That's affirmative, Jim. We haven't got a picture of it yet. It's going to be in the top part of the COAS - Correction, top part of the AOT at the top of the - the top of detent 2 and the top part of the AOT, and it should, in attitude, if you're right on the Sun, should split the cursor, though that roll angle is not too critical; if we're in about 10 degrees, we'll be okay. We - but I think - we think you should be able to get it better than that. On page 31, under the "DPS Burn Technique," you can scratch the bottom part below the little diagram there since the gimbal is locked. Over.
Understand scratch the bottom part underneath the diagram because the gimbal is locked.
That's affirmative; and, since the gimbal was trimmed out at the big burn yesterday, we should be still through the c.g., and we'd like to make sure that Jack sits in the same place for this burn that he did yesterday. That way, we'll - you should have no trouble controlling attitude. Now I'm ready to go over to page 32. Over.
Okay. Let me see if I have that right, now. You want Jack to sit in the same attitude so that the gimbals are the same place so you don't have trouble controlling attitude. I got it.
Okay. Now on page 32, top of the page, first line, scratch "VERB 76." Third line, "MODE CONTROL: AGS, ATT HOLD." At "Minus 6 minutes," scratch lines 1, 2, and at "Burn Attitude," scratch "VERB 40 NOUN 20." Scratch lines 2, 3, and 4. Now at "Burn Attitude," we want you to do a "400 plus 5" and then a "VERB - a 400 plus zero." And we have a caution note at this point. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. The caution is after "400 plus zero": Do not go out of detent on ACA again." Over.
Okay. After the last "400 plus zero," "Do not go out of detent with ACA." Is that correct?
That's a Roger, Jim. What happens is, of course, we set - when you go out of detent, you reset the AGS error needles and you - and you lose your attitude reference. You establish a new attitude reference, and it might not be the burn attitude since, at this point, we're controlling attitude with the TTCA. Now, picking up with the "VERB 37, ENTER," scratch. Scratch everything down to the "404 plus zero," and we want you to perform those AGS steps with 404 down through 470. Over.
Okay. We'll scratch everything down to "404 plus zero," and we'll perform those four steps.
Roger. Turning over to page 33. Minus 4 minutes. Okay. Moving down the page, it's about line 7, to "ENGINE GIMBAL": "ENGINE GIMBAL, OFF." Down to "MODE CONTROL," make that read "MODE CONTROL: AGS, ATT HOLD," and then scratch "PROPELLANT QUANTITY MONITOR, DESCENT 1." Over.
Okay. At 4 minutes, "ENGINE GIMBAL" will be "OFF"; "MODE CONTROL" will be to "AGS, ATT HOLD"; "PROPELLANT QUANTITY MONITOR, DESCENT 1," scratched.
Roger. Picking up at minus 1 minute, scratch "MASTER ARM, ON." Minus 35 seconds, scratch first two lines. At minus 10 seconds, change that to "Minus 9 seconds"; so, at "Minus 9 seconds," it will be "Manual Ullage." At 2 seconds, scratch "CMC MODE, FREE," and scratch "ACA out of detent." At - after "IGNITION," at plus 1 second, "Terminate Ullage." Are you with me? Over.
Okay. At 1 minute, "MASTER ARM," we scratch. At 35 seconds, scratch the first two lines. "Manual Ullage" will start at 9 seconds; we're scratching the blocks at 02 seconds; and the line beneath that, at plus 1 second, we "Terminate Ullage."
That's affirm. Picking up at plus 5 seconds; scratch the rest of the page. "TTCA, attitude control; and MASTER ARM, OFF." Over.
Scratch the remainder of the page.
Okay. Now, like to verify that under the 35 seconds, minus 35 seconds, the only thing you have remaining is "ENGINE ARM to DESCENT." Over.
That's affirm. That's the only thing I have.
Okay. Turning to the next page and the last page, Jim, 34. Top of the page, "Monitor DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> via 470." Scratch next two lines, "When propellant quantity equals 37" and the "DESCENT HELIUM REG." Scratch "TTCA commander, reduce to 10 percent." Now we want you to add a line; "shut" - It's a shutdown criteria, "shutdown on burn time minus 1 second." Over.
Okay, "The shutdown is on burn time minus 1 second." Let me give you an example. If we have a 30-second burn, we're going to shut down at 29 seconds. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. We'll give you the pad, be coming up here from FIDO in a couple of hours, I guess, when we stabilize out on our tracking. The reason for - If you're ready to copy out a couple of more steps, and then I'll explain the reason we want to shut down on this burn time minus 1 second. Picking up on "When DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> - -
Okay.
"- - When DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> equal to the final DELTA-V<sub>X</sub>," scratch that line. Scratch "ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE." Add - Correction, scratch "Damp excessive rates via LM Y, Z translation" and add at that point "Null" error needles. Trim address 470 to 0.1 foot per second." Over.
Okay, going through. After the "Shutdown on burn time minus 1 second," we scratch the next line; and we scratch "ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE"; we scratch "Damp excessive rates via LM Y, Z translation"; we add the line "Null" error needles, trim - Null the error needles and trim address 470 to - What was the value there, Charlie?
"0.1 foot per second." The reason we are shutting down on the burn time is, since the ASA breaker has been out for so long, we're not real confident that our AGS PIPAs are going to be super-sharp. So we want to make sure that we just get a burn time - no overburn; so we're shutting down on burn time minus 1 second. And then that will allow us a plus-X translation to trim 470 if it looks okay. If we had an overburn, we'd be in - -
Okay.
- - if we had an overburn, we'd be impinging on our command module to try to trim it out, so that's our reasoning there. Over.
Okay. Understand.
Okay. Picking up in the middle of the page, that - a block "CMS resume attitude control," scratch. Scratch the next line; "PRO VERB 96." Scratch the third line; "PROPELLANT QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF." Over.
Okay. We'll scratch the blocks, and we'll scratch the "PRO VERB 96"; then we'll scratch "PROPELLANT QUANTITY MONITOR, OFF."
Roger. Now, at the bottom of that page, I have a procedure for you to reestablish PTC. Over.
To reestablish PTC. Go ahead.
Okay. First line, "ATTITUDE CONTROL, three to PULSE"; line 2, "Roll with the TTCA until attitude is roll, plus or minus 90; pitch, 0; yaw, 0." Over.
Okay. Step 1, "ATTITUDE CONTROL, three to PULSE"; 2, "Roll with the TTCA ... pitch is 0 and yaw is 0," and I think that will be on the AGS ball.
That's affirmative. You broke up there for a minute, Jim. We'll do that on the AGS ball from the burn attitude. We just want you to roll either way 90 degrees, keep pitch 0 and yaw 0. Now, step 3; "When at - when at attitude, ACA out of detent." Step 4; "ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to MODE CONTROL. When rates are less than 0.05, ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE."
Okay, Charlie. Can you hold up here a second? I lost you.
Roger.
Start with step 3 again. "When attitude - When at attitude, ACA out of detent."
That's Roger. Next step, step 4: "ATTITUDE CONTROL to YAW" - Correction, "ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to MODE CONTROL." Over.
Okay. Step 4 is "ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to MODE CONTROL."
Roger. Step 5: "When rates are less than 0.05 degrees per second, ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE."
Okay. "When rates are less than 0.05 degrees per second, ATTITUDE CONTROL: YAW, to PULSE."
Roger. Step 6: "Spin up to 0.3 degree per second in yaw," and that takes about 21 pulses. Step 7 - Yes.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Step 7: "MODE CONTROL, AGS, OFF."
Okay. Step 6 was "Spin up to 0.3 degrees per second in yaw"; that's about 21 pulses. Step 7 was "MODE CONTROL, AGS, to OFF."
That's affirm. Step 8: "Power down per power" - Correction, "Power down per contingency checklist page Power 5." Over.
Okay. And step 8 is Power down per contingency checklist Power 5," and I take it that's been revamped considering our situation. Okay.
That's affirmative, Jim. That's the one we gave you last night after the big burn, and we'll use that one as modified by - by us. This - we tried this PTC under AGS in the simulator and, of course, no slosh or anything, but it seemed to work pretty good by nulling the rates using the TTCA in pitch and roll and letting the ACS do it in yaw. You null the rates by looking at the error needles and just watching those, and when they don't - when they stop moving, then you got it within the limits of what we want. Over.
Okay. And I guess, Charlie, you have no - Do you have a ATT hold mode in pitch and roll at all in this configuration we're in, or do we have to use the TTCA?
We feel like we have to use the TTCA. The AGS gains are not too good in pitch and roll in this configuration. It'll hold it in yaw but it won't in pitch and roll. Over.
Okay.
And you'll have - During the burn, of course, you'll be controlling pitch and roll via the error needles with the TTCA also, and it's the little scheme that we've practiced in some of the SIMs. Over.
Right. Understand.
And, Houston, want to make sure that we allow enough time to get to the proper attitude for the burn so that we can be sure we establish the proper attitude and don't have to rush the burn.
Roger, Jim. We -we're looking right now, tentatively, at starting this about 45 minutes before the burn and our sensitivity is - not too bad on this burn. We can go 30 minutes either way and not affect our DELTA-V. Over.
Okay. Fine. And do you have a handle on just how long the burn will be? In time?
It's looking like at about 7.8 seconds and about 15 - Correction, 7.8 feet per second and about 15 seconds. Over.
In about 18 seconds?
Negative. 15. 1 5.
1 5. Okay.
And one other point is that we'd like to remind you that this is going to be in blowdown and both REGs B closed but we've got plenty at the 10 percent.
Understand.
And, Jim, in the simulator with our configuration that we had here, the thing is real stable at 10 percent, so we don't think you'll have to tweak very much at all using the TTCA|TTCAs. Over.
Okay. Understand.
And I'll give you back to Vance. Thank you.
And thank you.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, regarding your number 2 battery, we think that it's probably a sensor failure, a temperature sensor failure that's caused this alarm, rather than an actual overtemp of the battery; the reason being that we haven't seen any higher temperatures in the glycol loop. We expect to put the battery back on about 101 hours. That'll be about 10 minutes, and then we'll look at it some more there. Over.
Okay. Concerning number 2 battery, you think it might be a sensor failure because you haven't seen any changes, and you're going to put the battery back on the line in about 10 minutes.
That's affirm.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
For information, Vance, about a half hour ago, I guess, Jack and I couldn't see constellations at certain spacecraft attitudes, stars. We could see the - Scorpio and Sagittarius and we could see Altair or Acrux and Alpha Centuri, Vega, stars of that magnitude, and our venting has stopped which allows us now to differentiate between the particles and the stars.
Roger; copy. Understand you can see the stars pretty well. Were you, at that time, in an attitude facing away from the Sun? I presume this is very attitude critical.
Yes. It is somewhat, Vance. If we have the Sun shining off the quads, it sort of ruins our vision; and also, if the Earth or the Moon are in the general field of view, we can't see anything.
Okay. Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Jim, we're ready to put that battery back on the line. Request you open the CROSS TIE BAL LOAD circuit breaker, panel 16, and then put back - BAT 2 back on the line.
Okay. First of all, we'll open the BALANCE CROSS TIE breaker on panel 16.
That's affirm.
Okay. The CROSS TIE BALANCE LOAD circuit breakers is in now, Vance. Now you want us to put battery 2 back on. Is that affirm?
Did you say it was in, or did you pull it out?
No. It's in; do you want it out?
That's affirm. We'd like it out, and then BAT 2 on the line.
Okay. Coming up. BAT 2 is on the line. We have a MASTER ALARM and a BATTERY light.
Copy. And - and we think that's probably an indication of the sensor problem, but stand by.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, it looks to us like your battery is good, that this is in fact a sensor problem; therefore, request you close the CROSS TIE BAL LOADs on - circuit breaker on panel 16. Advise - -
Okay.
- - advise that you will not have any malfunction indication on any of your batteries now, but we can watch it from the ground. Over.
Okay. We'll close the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOAD circuit breaker at this time.
Roger. Copy.
That's closed, and we don't have any warning on any of the batteries, but you can monitor from the ground.
That's affirm.
And, Jim, we have a lengthy procedure here for powering up the CSM and turning on instrumentation so we can check the TM, and this will take a large piece of scratch paper whenever you're ready to copy.
This is to power up the CSM?
That's affirm.
Okay. I'll tell you what, I'll have Jack get configured. He can copy that down and I'll have him - we'll get the stuff. Stand by.
Okay.
Okay, Vance, how do you read the Aquarius?
Okay, read you loud and clear, Aquarius. Is it cool in there now?
Okay. Yes, it's pretty cool. This is the third officer on this LM crew here. Ready to copy.
Okay. Jack, this is a lengthy procedure, take probably two or three pages. It assumes that you are in your nominal configuration, which was sent up - or in your day-flying configuration, which was sent up to you earlier today.
Okay. I can verify that we are in that configuration with the exception of panel 382, the water accumulator, which I've left off in case we wanted to get some more drinking water out of the command module, and I'll put those in the proper configuration before we do anything.
Okay. Ready to copy?
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Panel 4: TELCOMM, GROUP 1, to AC1. Panel 5: close the following circuit breakers: ECS, PRESS GROUP 1, MAIN B; ECS, PRESS GROUP 2, MAIN B; ECS, TEMP, MAIN B; ECS, SECONDARY LOOP TRANSDUCER, MAIN B; ECS RAD, CONTROL/HEATERS, MAIN B; BAT RELAY BUS, BAT B; BAT CHARGER, BAT B, CHARGE - or to B, CHARGE; INVERTER CONTROL, 2; INVERTER CONTROL, 1; EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC1; EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B; EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC BUS 1; WASTE/POTABLE WATER, MAIN B; INSTRUMENTS, ESS, MAIN B; that's ESSENTIAL, MAIN B. Are you with me?
Okay, Vance. Are you with me?
Roger. Why don't you read that group back, and then we'll proceed on.
Okay, sounds good. Because I don't know where I - how far I lost you. Okay, panel 4; TELCOMM, GROUP 1, to AC1. On panel 5, close the following circuit breakers: ECS, PRESSURE GROUP 1, MAIN B; ECS, PRESSURE GROUP 2, MAIN B; ECS, TEMP, MAIN B; ECS, SECONDARY LOOP TRANSDUCER, MAIN B; ECS RAD, CONTROL/HEATERS, MAIN B; BAT RELAY BUS, BAT B; BAT CHARGER, BAT B; INVERTER CONTROL, 2; INVERTER CONTROL, 1; EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC1; EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B; EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC1; WASTE/POTABLE H<sub>2</sub>O, MAIN B; INSTRUMENTATION, ESSENTIAL, MAIN B.
Okay; That's all correct. Is that reading rate okay for you?
Yes, that's fine.
Okay, and leave a little space if you can to the right of these because when we talk about the backup procedure, why then we can just use the same listing, and I'll - I'll tell you open instead of close these circuit breakers, or at least most of them. Over.
Okay.
Okay. Next, panel 3: TRANSPONDER, PRIMARY; POWER AMPL, to PRIMARY, that's a verify; POWER AMPL, HIGH; MODE, VOICE, to OFF; POWER, SCE, to NORMAL; PMP to NORMAL; S-BAND ANTENNA, OMNI D, that's Delta. Okay, why don't you read that one back?
Okay. On panel 3: TRANSPONDER to PRIMARY; POWER AMPLIFIER to PRIMARY; POWER AMPL, HIGH; MODE, VOICE, to OFF; POWER, SCE, to NORMAL; PMP to NORMAL; S-BAND ANTENNA, OMNI D, D as in Doggy.
Hey, very good. Okay, panel 225: circuit breaker FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, to close; circuit breaker CTE, MAIN B, to close. Panel 250: CB BAT C BAT CHARGER/EDS 2 to close.
Hey, Vance, just a minute. Slow down, would you?
Okay.
Okay. I got distracted here. On panel 225: CB FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, close; and then I lost you after that.
Okay. After that, CB CTE, MAIN B, to close. Next, panel 250: CB BAT C BAT CHARGE/EDS2 to close; CB BAT C POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to close. Next, panel 275: CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B, to close; CB INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, to close. Okay. Incidentally, anything that I've given you up until now is not sequence critical, but from now on, it should be - you should be sure to do it in the sequence we give you. Why don't you read that back, Jack?
Okay. Let me give you all of panel 225 again. CB FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, close; CB CTE, MAIN B, close. On panel 250: CB BAT - B BAT CHARGE, that should be BAT C, Charlie, isn't it? BAT CHARGE/EDS2 closed?
That's right. That's - -
CB BAT B POWER ENTRY -
Okay. That should be BAT Charlie.
Let me finish. Okay. That's what I thought. BAT Charlie BAT CHARGE/EDS2, close; BAT Baker POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, closed. On panel 275: CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed; CB INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, closed.
Okay. That's correct except for the second circuit breaker on panel 250, which is CB BAT Charlie POWER ENTRY slash POSTLANDING, close.
Okay. BAT Charlie POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING.
Okay, now back to panel 250. CB BAT Bravo POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close. Next, MDC 3, AC INVERTER 2 to MAIN B. AC INVERTER 2, AC BUS 1, on up. Next, panel 5: AC INVERTER AC BUS 1 to RESET and then center. Panel 3: UP TLM to COMMAND RESET then OFF. Then select best OMNI. Readback, please.
Okay, Vance. The following steps are sequence critical. Panel 250: CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, closed. That's BAT Baker. MDC 3, AC INVERTER 2, to MAIN B; AC INVERTER 2, AC1, on. ...
How do you read now, Jack?
Okay, Vance. Did you - how far did you - did you copy any of my steps there?
Okay, I heard you through AC INVERTER 2, AC BUS 1 to on, and you were cut out by noise. Go ahead.
Okay, Now comes to one I didn't understand. You said go over to MDC 5 and A in - AC INVERTER, AC BUS 1, RESET, then center, and then back to MDC 3; UP TELEMETRY, COMMAND RESET then OFF, and then select best OMNI.
Roger. The readback's correct, but let me recheck that. Stand by.
Jack, we were incorrect on panel 5; that should have been panel 3.
Okay, that's good. I got it.
Okay. Now, when you're in this configuration, the following onboard readouts are required. Panel 3: BAT C voltage, PYRO BAT A voltage, PYRO BAT B voltage, SPS HELIUM PRESSURE. And the following readouts on panel 101: CM RCS injector temperatures, those are positions 5 Charlie, 5 Delta, 6 Alfa, 6 Bravo, 6 Charlie, 6 Delta; and the battery manifold pressure, which is 4 Alfa. And standing by for readback.
Okay. You want me to read out on MDC 3: BAT B voltage, PYRO A voltage, PYRO B voltage, SPS HELIUM PRESSURE. On panel 101: command module RCS injector temperatures; 5 Charlie, 5 Dog, 6 Alfa, 6 Baker, 6 Charlie, 6 Dog. The battery manifold pressure, 4 Alfa.
Okay. Now - that was correct but I want to re-check the very first one, that was BAT Charlie voltage. Is that what you read back?
Okay. Okay, BAT Charlie voltage. Seems like we're having a difference - I can't understand BAT Charlie from BAT Dog.
Okay. Now, that - that complete procedure for getting into it, as far as getting into it's concerned. What I will give you now is how to back out of it after you're through with your readings. Are you ready to copy?
Okay.
Okay. Now you'll back out fairly quickly after you go into this procedure. All we'll need is about 5 minutes of TM, and so if you're ready to copy, here it comes.
Go ahead.
Panel 3: POWER AMPL to OFF. Incidentally, copy this down on a piece of scratch paper as I read it, and then later I'll refer back to your first list where you can write things in the right-hand margin.
Okay.
Okay - -
Go ahead. You want - Repeat the one on panel 3 again, Vance.
Okay. POWER AMPL, OFF.
Okay. Go ahead.
TRANSPONDER, OFF. AC INVERTER, 2, to OFF. Okay. Next, panel 250: CB BAT Bravo, POWER ENTRY/ POSTLANDING to open. Stand by 1.
Okay, Jack. What I just gave you now on the backout is the only thing that's order critical. From here on, you can go to the steps for initiating the procedure, and backtrack. In other words, you should go to each of the panels that I read up and put the circuit breakers back to the base-line configuration - or the switches. Over.
Okay, now here's - to accent, here's the sequence-critical sets: POWER AMPL, OFF; TRANSPONDER OFF; AC INVERTER, 2, OFF; and the last one on panel 250, CB BAT Baker POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, open; and then hit the steps in reverse order that you gave them to me, and back out, like then I would start on MDC 3 UP TELEMETRY, OFF - to OFF; and then AC INVERTER - AC1 BUS 1 to OFF; and then AC INVERTER, 2, OFF; AC INVERTER, 2, MAIN B to OFF. Is that the type of order that you want to back out of?
That's affirm, but - just for kicks, let's go through these panels again, and I'll give you the - the position, just to make sure there can be no doubt.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. And once again in the - in the area where I said order was not critical, it's still not critical when you back out. But now I'll go ahead. Okay, panel 4: TELCOMM, GROUP 1, AC1, it will not be AC1, it'll go to OFF. Panel 5: all circuit breakers on that panel which were positioned will now come to opened. Over.
Okay. Panel 4: TELCOMM, GROUP 1 will go OFF. Panel 5: all the circuit breakers that we closed will go back to open.
Okay. Panel 3: the first three lines have been taken care of already in my beginning in the backout procedure, so starting with MODE, VOICE, that should go back to VOICE. POWER, SCE, OFF; PMP, OFF; S-BAND ANTENNA, OMNI Bravo. Panel 225: CB FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, open; CB CTE, MAIN B, open. Read back.
Okay, Vance. I'm going to have to switch OMNIs. I'm starting to get some static here.
Okay.
Okay. How do you read on AFT OMNI?
Loud and clear.
Okay. On panel 3: the first three steps we took care of; MODE, VOICE, to VOICE; POWER, SCE, OFF; POWER PMP to OFF; and S-BAND OMNI would go back to Bravo. Panel 225: FLIGHT BUS, MAIN B, will go open; and CB CTE, MAIN B, will go open.
That's affirm. The two circuit breakers on panel 250 will go open; the two circuit breakers, panel 275, will go open. Okay, the circuit breakers on panel 250, we took care of already. Panel 3: AC INVERTER, 2, we took care of. AC INVERTER 2, AC BUS 1 should now go OFF. And the remaining two switches on panel 3 we took care of. And "Select best OMNI" remains the same. Okay. Read back.
Okay. The two switches - two circuit breakers on panel 250 will go back to open; the two circuit breakers on panel 275 back to open; the POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING circuit breaker, we already took care of earlier; AC INVERTER 2; we took care of earlier; AC INVERTER 2 to AC BUS 1 will go to OFF; and AC INVERTER, AC BUS 1, we took care of - No, that'll go to OFF; and UP TELEMETRY, COMMAND RESET will go OFF.
That's correct, Jack. Okay, that's it. And I think we're about ready to go with this procedure whenever you are.
Okay. First we got to go through that procedure to power the CSM from the LM, is that Charlie?
No. No, this is independent of power from the LM. This is a - this is purely a CSM - -
Okay.
This is purely a CSM powerup so we can take a look at your telemetry and see how cold the vehicle is and that sort of thing.
Okay. It's going in work.
Okay, now I won't - I won't have any voice with you, so - Is that right? You don't want me to get connected up - you want me to just take these readings and come back and tell you what I have, huh?
That's affirm. There'll be no voice. And - -
Okay. Okay. In work.
I - we presume, though, that there'll be somebody in the LM that we can call if we have to get word to you.
Oh, yes. There'll be somebody to be standing by, they'll run up into the bedroom and tell me to stop what I'm doing.
Okay, and let us know when you start.
Okay. I'm going to start right now, Vance.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. Switching watches, and Jack's going up into the command module.
Okay, Jim. We have four steps here to give you to request that you get back on DOWN VOICE BACKUP, if you're ready to copy?
Ready to copy.
Okay. Bit rate to LO bit rate. VOICE, FUNCTION switch to DOWN VOICE BACKUP. POWER AMPs CB, open; RANGE FUNCTION switch in RANGING; that's verify.
Okay. Bit rate, LO; VOICE FUNCTION, DOWN VOICE BACKUP; POWER AMP S-BAND, open; and RANGE FUNCTION to RANGE; and that's a verify. And I still have the BIOMED on RIGHT here, so we don't have hot mike.
Okay. Thank you.
And, you want that in work, now?
That's affirm.
Okay.
Okay. Houston, Aquarius. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Jim.
Okay. I have a question for you, Houston, if you have time.
Sure, go ahead.
And I'm copying down the reestablishing - PTC maneuver that Charlie gave me. Step 5 was, "When rates are less than 0.05 degrees per second, ATTITUDE CONTROL YAW to PULSE." And just how am I to get my rates down to 0.05 degrees per second. My - My rate indicator, at the best, is 0.1 of a degree.
Stand by.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, this has been tried in the simulator by Charlie and others, and what they recommend is that you null your rates on the error needles until you see no movement whatsoever, and then wait another couple of minutes, and that should do it. That's the only way we can tell. Over.
Okay. I'll give it the old college try.
Okay. And if you can't attain that, why, of course, just the best you can do. We'll have to give it a try. Maybe it won't be quite like the simulator.
Right.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay, Vance. I've gone all the way through your procedure - all the way down to "Select best OMNIs," but I'm not getting any MAIN BUS B voltage and this I don't understand.
Roger.
I can read - I can read BAT - BAT BUS B voltage at 36.5. ...
Okay, Jack. Do you read now?
I am not sure, Vance.
Okay. You faded out due to noise in the orientation. If you close the POWER AMP circuit breaker, we can hear you better. Over.
That's panel 16.
Okay.
Okay. You faded out at the very beginning, so please go through that again. We understand you don't get anything on MAIN B.
Okay, Vance. How are you reading now?
Okay. We're hearing you better. Stand by 1.
Okay, Jack. Please, repeat back now your conversation. You were cut out for - a while ago.
I don't have any idea where we cut out, Vance. I just said that we performed the procedure exactly as you say. We're down into the SEP critical portion to where I said, "select best OMNI." However, we're not getting any MAIN BUS B voltage reading. I can read BAT BUS B, Baker, at 36.5; BAT Charlie at 37.0, but I have negative MAIN BUS B readings.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay, Jack. There are two - There's a switch and a circuit breaker that were positioned this morning that we'd like to have you check - Correction, just the switch. Panel 5, check your bus tie. MAIN BUS TIE BAT B/C on.
That is verified on. I checked that.
Okay.
Okay, Jack; this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. We're getting data from you, Jack, so that much looks good. On panel 5, request verification that EPS SENSOR SIGNAL circuit breaker is MAIN B. Over.
Okay.
Or it's - -
- - Stand by. - -
- - that MAIN B is closed.
Okay.
Okay, Jack. And, we see your MAIN BUS B voltage at 28-1/2.
Okay. You can see it. Good. Okay then. Okay, Vance. That circuit breaker is in.
Copy.
Well, Vance, if you're getting data from them, let me go back up there and finish the ...
Okay, Jack. Please repeat, you're cutting out.
Okay, Vance. Okay. We just changed OMNIs here. I say, if you're getting data from us, that's the important thing. Let me go back up into the bedroom there and get the readings you wanted, so we can get this stuff powered down. Is that okay?
Okay, we'll get - -
- - by all means and - -
- - down there - -
- - select best OMNI - -
- - and then go back up.
Okay, Vance. We'll go back up - We've got voltage now, and we'll go back up and take the readings that you want.
Okay. And select best OMNI.
Okay. I'm going back up into the bedroom, Vance. How do you read?
Loud and clear.
Okay. I'm going back up to the bedroom. We'll select best OMNI and continue on with the procedure.
Roger.
Okay, Vance. Jim's up. How do you read?
Reading you loud and clear, Jim.
Okay.
And, Houston, I noticed through the AOT and through the overhead docking window that we are venting again.
Okay, Jim. Understand; the service module is venting.
That's affirm.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, would you holler into the bedroom and tell Jack that when he has his onboard readouts that we wish he'd back - use the backout procedure and shut down again - per the procedure we gave him.
Roger. As soon as he - As soon as he gets his onboard readouts to use the powerdown procedure and shut down. Is that right?
That's affirm.
Okay. Jack just - Jack just told me that he's through, and he's going to go through the backout procedures again, the first one he's got is the shutdown.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Jack's ready to give you the readings if you are ready to copy them.
Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay, Vance. The readings that you wanted; are you ready?
Ready to copy, Jack.
BAT Charlie, 37.0; pyro A, 37.0; pyro B, 37.0; SPS helium pressure, 3450; and just for kicks, nitrogen A, 2300; nitrogen B, 2400; CM RCS injector temperatures: 5 Charlie, 4.5; 5 Dog, 3.5; 6 Alfa, 4.0; 6 Baker, 4.6; 6 Charlie, 4.0; 6 Dog, 3.8; battery manifold pressure, 4 Alfa, 1.4.
Okay, Jack, We got it. Thank you very much.
Okay. How does the telemetry look on our - on the old Odyssey?
It doesn't look too cold. Looks pretty good.
Okay. Thank you very much.
You bet.
We're going to need him.
How does it feel, Jack?
I'll tell you, Deke, it's cold up in there. I don't know whether we'll be able to sleep up there tonight; it must be about 35 or 40 degrees.
Roger. That's just what I was worrying about.
Right now, we're getting two sets of CWGs on.
It's not uncomfortable at all in Aquarius, but it definitely is cold in Odyssey.
Roger.
Okay, Vance. Jim's back on.
Go ahead, Jim.
We just had a change in watch; that's all.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston, Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, two items: in the command module, we wish to verify that the PYRO BATTERY selector was left in the main position. And we're ready to have the POWER AMP circuit breaker on panel 16 pulled, whenever you are ready.
Okay, Vance. Fred just tells me that he put it there, and we're checking that again about the PYRO BATTERY selector in the main position.
Okay. Understand that you are checking it.
And I will pull the POWER AMP circuit breaker.
Roger.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
How does number 2 battery look to you now?
Stand by.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, it looks like it was probably a sensor problem; the battery number 2 is load-sharing well. And we see no indications of higher temperatures in the glycol loop or anything that would make us think that it is heating up.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
Houston, Aquarius.
Roger. Go ahead.
I just want to talk over a little philosophy here. Fred told me that at one time you came up and told him that we were a little steep on the entry angle, and now our burn is going to make us - give us a steeper angle. I just want to make sure that we're all talking about the same thing, that, in essence, at this particular situation, we're shallow, are not steep, and we are going to increase the angle.
Jim, the situation is that, at the moment, we're a little bit shallow, and retrograde midcourse is going to put us more in the center of the corridor. Over.
Okay; fine. I just wanted to make sure. Fred had written down some time ago, that - that our angle now was about 71 and we were going to do a midcourse of 7 feet per second because its appears that we're going to shallow it out. I think we're all talking the same language now.
Roger. And, I guess it follows, but your perigee is a little bit high right now, too; so that will be bringing it back - back down, that is.
Yes. Yes, that's the important thing.
One other question, Jim. Our readings down here say your LM cabin's about as cold as the command module cabin. Is that right?
Well, we really don't know. There's usually two people in the LM cabin, and it's a lot - It seems to be a lot more compact, and so we don't notice the coldness down here as we do in the command module.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
Some time ago, I copied down a long COMM midcourse-7 corridor control burn at a GET of 134:59:42.98. Is that burn pad still valid?
Jim, that's affirm. That pad is still valid.
And that is assuming no midcourse 7 here at 105 hours.
That's affirm.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, we're setting up your burn for 105:30, and we'll be working up a pad, et cetera, based on that time. Over.
Roger. The time will 105:30.
And, additional point; I guess this one's for Jack. Do we have any idea why we couldn't read the MAIN BUS B voltage a while back when first he didn't get it and then later he did?
Yes. I think we have a reason for that. Stand by.
It appears, Vance, that the battery charge circuit breaker which appeared to be in, wasn't in. Fred pulled it and reset it, and then he started getting readings.
Roger. Which circuit breaker was that?
It was - It was the battery charge circuit breaker that allows you to read volts, but we haven't - don't know the exact name for it yet.
Okay. Understand.
The name is BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE Jack tells me.
Okay. BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Have you opened your - just curiosity - Have you opened your food locker just aft of the LM data file? Over.
Yes. It's been opened.
Okay. Just checking. Thanks.
. .. meal had come through.
Good.
It came at the right time.
Good.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Jim, we have some CSM temperatures here for you that might be of interest, if you're ready to copy.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. Your quad package temperatures range from 85 degrees to 44 degrees. Your CM RCS injectors range from 44 degrees to 21; and your heat shield is well above its lower limits in all the various locations. Temperatures appear to be cycling based on Sun angle, and it's no sweat. They all look very good.
Sounds good.
Were you calling, Houston?
Negative, Jim.
Okay.
And, Houston, how do you read Aquarius?
Read you loud and clear, Fred. How do you read?
Okay. ...
Roger. We were just about to send you up some items of information pertaining to the burn. Are you ready to copy?
Stand by.
Okay.
Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay, Fred. First of all, preparations for this, starting with contingency checklist, page 24, we would recommend should start at 104:30 GET, and we'll be happy to receive any comments you have on that, though. Second point: when you're in the burn attitude, you should see the Sun at the very top of the AOT. It'll be splitting the cursor, when your cursor's set at zero. One thing to be aware of though, that it'll slip right out of the AOT very easily since it'll be very sensitive to roll and yaw. Understand that's in detent 2, by the way. Next point: the burn is very insensitive to burn time and attitude. In other words, if necessary, we can slip it if there's any problem at all, and attitude isn't too critical. So that brings us to the point that we only have one real burn rule; that is, if - rate about any axis gets to 10 degrees a second, that's the limit to stop the burn. Next point, after you finish the burn, and before you trim, request that you leave DEDA in address 470 up a while so we can take a look at it, and let us holler when we've seen it, and then proceed on. Over.
Okay, Vance. You're saying we should start into the PREP in the contingency book at about 104:30, and I'll talk this over in a minute with Jim and we'll get back with you on it. When in the burn attitude, we should see the Sun right at the top of the AOT, and I assume this is detent number 2. Jim and I'd already been talking about that, and just eyeballing the terminator in the Earth, we figured the Sun at about something like a 70-degree angle - 65-degree angle, so that'll be right up there. We get one burn rule that says if the rates are greater than 10 degrees per second, shut her down. And, after we trim, you want me to leave 470 up for a while so you all can have a look at it, and you'll tell me when to get rid of it.
That's right, Fred. And, if you have any questions at all regarding the alinement, why please let us know. We'll be happy to answer them, like alining on the Earth, as was described before. Also, you should know that the pitch is the most critical attitude so far as errors are concerned in this burn; but, as I said, it's still not very sensitive.
Yes, the - and unfortunately, the way we're looking out the window through the COAS, we can aline the yaw and roll pretty well, but it's the - Sun that has to get us pitch.
Right. And - and a correction on this DEDA 470 thing. Request that we let you - Give you a GO before you trim. Over.
Say - Say again, Vance, on that last.
Roger. We would like to see address 470, and give you a GO before you trim. Over.
Oh, okay. I - I see. Okay. After burn, we'll leave 470 up a while and wait for your word to do the trim.
That's correct. How was the sleep?
Okay. And -
Okay. Vance, are you there?
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. The picture that Jim gave me on his view through the COAS was within the - the partial Earth, the lit portion laying in the top half of the COAS with the cusp laying right on the Y-Y line. And so the - The whole dark part of the Earth would be at the bottom part of the Earth, except a very thin crescent of the dark part to a line - line above the Y-Y line.
Okay. That is correct.
And that in essence - that in - Yes, that in essence would put our X-axis pointing toward the Sun.
That's correct. The plus X-axis pointing toward the Sun and perpendicular to the terminator of the Earth.
Okay.
Two other points, Fred. One is that we don't expect hardly any misalinement of your engine for the burn, so we don't really expect any rates throughout the length of the burn, especially since it's at very low thrust. Second point, request you verify that your suit temperature rheostat's in FULL COLD. That - if it - If it were in FULL COLD, that might help your cabin temperature situation. It might bring the temperature up.
Okay.
Okay. The latter was a good point. We had it in FULL HOT.
Very good.
And Roger on the - Roger on the rates, too.
Okay.
Okay, Vance. Is the Tig|T<sub>ig</sub> time going to be approximately - Is it 105 or 105:30?
It's 105:30.
Okay. Your 104:30 time to start in is - sounds pretty good. That'll give us lots of time to get set up with the attitude business, in case we have any trouble stopping PTC and getting there and - That will give us a little time to be sitting and waiting, all set up.
Okay, Fred. Good.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Are you calling, Vance?
Right, Fred. We just noticed a 2-pound drop in your water quantity. Have you guys had a drink recently or do you know any reason why it might have dropped? Over.
Negative.
Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston.
All right. Go ahead, Vance.
Fred, that may be a funny in the data. The rate's gone back to normal; and we'll keep an eye on it, but we don't think you should worry about it too much.
Let's hope not.
And, Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Are we going to get any sort of a pad on this?
That's affirm, Fred. Estimating we'll have it to you in about 15 minutes.
Okay.
And, Houston, you might just let us know if there's any chance it's going to slip further down the road, because we're going to kind of hold to that 104:30 start time. And if you're going to delay any, we'll delay accordingly.
Roger. We won't have any trouble making that, Fred, I'm told.
Okay.
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Roger. We have about 104 degrees now. How does that ...?
Okay. FIDO's hustling here. We'll try to get it right up to you. Stand by.
...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
We have ...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Vance, we have the quad heaters on, now.
Roger. Copy, Jim. And the - Jack's going to read you the pad right now, so I recommend you go ahead and get started. You shouldn't be delayed by the pad at all.
Aquarius, Houston. I've got your burn pad.
Roger, Houston. Stand by. Are you ready - Stand by to copy. Okay. Ready to copy.
Okay. A P30 maneuver pad on the DPS: purpose is midcourse 5, NOUN 33, 105:30:00.00, NOUN 81 is N/A, H<sub>A</sub> is N/A, perigee, plus 0019.8, 0.007.8, 0.15, the rest is N/A. Shut down the engine at 1 second prior to the end of burn time. Shut down at 14 seconds manually. Ullage is four jets for 10 seconds, 10-percent throttle. Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. We've got a DPS midcourse 5: NOUN 33, 105:30:00.00; NOUN 81, N/A; H<sub>A</sub> N/A; plus 0019.8, 0007.8, burn time 0.15, the rest of the pad, N/A. Shut down manually at 14 seconds, ullage four jets for 10 seconds, and the entire burn is at 10-percent throttle.
Okay, Fred. I want to verify that your DELTA-V<sub>R</sub> is 0007.8.
Okay. I read you back 0007.8.
Okay. Good readback. You got it.
Aquarius, Houston, I have some additional entry data that goes with the pad I just read up. It's five items. Let me know when you're ready to copy. It's on a maneuver pad.
Okay. I'll try to squeeze them in there, Jack. I'm rapidly running out of pads.
Go ahead.
Okay. It's N/A all the way down to NOUN 61. Your latitude is minus 21 - -
Hold on a minute; hold on. You need the - Hold on, Jack, I need the other pad book, that CSM pad.
That's affirm.
Okay. Now I'm ready.
Okay. NOUN 61: latitude, minus 21.67, minus 165.37, 1163.1, 36292, 142:41.02. Read back.
Okay. NOUN 61; minus 21.67, minus 165.37. 1163.1, 36292, 142:41.02.
Good readback.
And you should have high bit rate now, Jack.
Okay, Fred. We're getting it now.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Did you have readouts on our quad temps to know when we can start? We're taking a time hack. We'd just like a verification with you.
Roger. Your quad temps look good from here.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We're going to stop PTC at this time.
Roger, Aquarius. Go ahead.
How about if you do - -
Say again, Jack.
Negits on my last, Fred.
Okay, Jack. How do you read now?
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. I thought you called, Jack. We're maneuvering around here to fish for the Earth.
And, Houston, Aquarius. How's the ASA package temp look now?
Okay, Fred. The ASA package temp is looking good. It's around 98 degrees, and we'd like to see it go up about 15 to 20 degrees.
Okay. Why don't you give me the word before I proceed with the AGS. We really don't need it right this instant.
Roger. We'll be watching it.
Aquarius, Houston. The ASA package temp is up now so you can activate the AGS.
Okay. Very good.
Okay, Jack. So we can make sure and get our timer set here, I wondered when your - you've got about 48 minutes to the burn which should be coming up pretty quick - you'd give us a hack so we could set our event timer at 12.
Roger, Fred. I understand you want a mark at 17 minutes prior to the burn. Is that affirm?
Roger. We think we got it set now. We just wanted to check it. If we don't, then I'll set it to 13, and you can give me another hack at 47 to go.
Okay. We got 33 to go.
MARK.
My mistake. It was 33 - -
Right on.
Roger. It was reading 33 on my mark. Right?
Okay. You got about 105:03 GET now down there?
That's affirmative, Fred. Going through 105:03:45.
MARK.
Okay.
Okay, Jack. Give me the next number you want me to set then, and I'll take another hack here.
Roger. You're counting up, right?
Roger.
Okay, Fred. On my mark, be 35 minutes to the burn.
Standing by.
We missed her, Fred. Let's get it on the next minute.
Okay.
Okay, Aquarius. On my mark, it's going to be 34 minutes to the burn, and you'll be reading 36. Stand by.
MARK.
Okay. We got it cranked up.
Okay, Houston. We have our attitude set.
Roger, Jim.
I hope the guys in the back room who thought this up right knew what they were saying.
And I'm looking through the AOT there, Jack, and the Sun's right in the top and it's about maybe 2 degrees to the right of the cursor. So that looks real good.
Roger. Good going.
Okay, Aquarius. The attitude looks good here and your choice when you want to start the burn.
We're counting down, aren't we, or do you want us to start any time?
Your choice.
You guys are getting easy.
It's not time critical, Jim.
I understand.
And, Houston, we reset our clock and we're making the burn in about - I'll give you a hack here at 2 minutes to go.
Roger, Fred. And let us know when you're going to ullage, will you?
Okay.
Okay. Stand by. 2, 1.
MARK it.
Three minutes to go. Correction, 2 minutes to go, Jack.
Roger. Two minutes. We got it.
Aquarius, Houston. Check engine gimbal off, please.
It's verified to off. And -
MARK it.
One minute.
Roger, Fred.
ENGINE ARM to DESCENT.
ULLAGE.
Okay. You're looking at 470.
Roger. We copy 7.4.
Roger. 7.4 and I had about 0.2 showing, I guess, when we started.
Roger. We verify that, Okay, Aquarius. Trim it to 7.6.
Okay. You want plus-X now to get 7.6. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
Okay. You're looking at it, Houston.
Okay. Looks good. Nice work.
Let's hope it was.
Okay, Aquarius. We're ready to follow you through on setting up PTC and powerdown. Your choice.
Okay. We're pressing into getting PTC established right now.
Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to change the number of yaw pulses we gave you before as 21. We'd like to reduce that to 12. Twelve pulses yaw right, and that'll take you about 3 seconds to get them in if you don't want to count them.
Okay. We'll make it 12 versus 21.
Okay, Houston. I'm just about there now and as soon as I get 90, we'll start damping rates.
Roger, Aquarius.
Okay, Houston. I'm trying to damp rates now. We're at the proper roll attitude and pitch.
Roger, Aquarius.
Working a little bit better this time.
Are you copying any attitudes down there, rates, et cetera?
Okay, Aquarius. We're seeing some extremely low rates at this time, really below our capability to measure them.
Roger.
Houston, I think I've got pitch and roll just about squared away. I let yaw just slightly drift; it's drifting in a clockwise direction and I'm about all set now to put in my 12 clicks to the right.
Roger, Jim. Ready to look at it with you.
Twelve clicks right.
Okay, Jack. Are we clear now to proceed with the powerdown?
That's affirmative, Fred. We're ready to press on with powerdown. I've got two changes for you. Step 1 of the emergency powerdown on page power - 5. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. Leave your POWER AMPLIFIER switch in PRIMARY vice OFF and put your RANGING switch to RANGE, vice OFF/RESET.
Okay. We're in PRIM in the POWER AMP and RANGING on RANGING.
Affirmative.
Okay. I'm going to pull. Well, here, let's just look at the checklist.
Okay. Configure CBs. There you go.
Aquarius, Houston, hold off 1 on powerdown, please.
Okay. We'll hold off. And we're looking at a SHe pressure, incidentally, of about 1830 now.
Roger. We concur with that. And it looks like you got a little pitch rate going on here. Do you copy the same?
Okay. My pitch needle is just slightly up now. I could try to take it out if you want me to.
Not - Wait, wait. There you go.
Just hold off on it 1, Jim. We'd like to take a look at it.
Okay.
Aquarius, we'll need high bit rate, please.
Flashlight, Jack. Jack, flashlight over here a minute.
Aquarius, we need the POWER AMPLIFIER back in high bit rate, please.
You got it.
You got a couple in the roll pretty soon.
What is it, 1.7?
You have another set of them by the PGNS.
Now we got to turn on the heaters you want to save -
What's that flitting out there in the breeze? Are we venting again? Take a look, Jack.
Well, once we get squared away, Joe, I think I am going to have to go to the space center and take a good healthy one and leave just about everything. I've held up long enough.
That's coming from above. Another one just - is just coming down right over here. Well, there's the old terminator at Fra Mauro. We'd been landing about 2 hours ago, huh? Right on the - -
Houston, Aquarius.
- - to the right of the terminator.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Just for information, although I thought I'd never have to use it, that technique looked like it was a pretty good one.
Roger, Jim. And we'd like you to give us your idea of how the PTC looks. We're not sure we're seeing what we ought to here.
Okay. I still have my ball powered up and I'm coming around past 270 right now. I've got a slight roll and pitch offset in there. My pitch needle about halfway up and my roll needle is about 4 degrees over now.
Okay, Jim. With that info we'll go on the PTC, and let's proceed with the powerdown.
Okay. We'll proceed with the PTC and proceed with the powerdown. I guess if we have to we can reestablish PTC at a later date. Okay. Okay.
First row. Ullage. AGS.
Your AGS on?
My what? My what? Oh, yes. Go ahead.
Okay. The four INVERTERS of this AC BUS volt, Fred.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Let's - give the last thing to Jack and I'll keep it all out. Okay? RCS SYSTEM A. That's in. TCAs are going off. Why do they need the ISOL valves in the ASCENT FEED in?
You're not sucking any power unless you take these switches and move them.
How come we pulled them out, then, in this burn?
Because you didn't want them to get moved inadvertently, I guess. It doesn't matter, Jim, they can be out or in in terms of powerdown. They just don't count.
Okay. I got 1, 2, 3.
ISOL valve should be in 2.
Yes. Okay. Third row. Attitude DIRECT CONTROL I still have in.
Jack, how do you read now in baseband?
Reading you 5-square, Fred. How me?
Okay. I'll stay this mode, if it's all right, so we won't be hot miked.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. You're cleared to open the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker and go to LOW BIT RATE, leaving the POWER AMP switch in PRIMARY.
Okay. I'll pull the prime S-BAND POWER AMP breaker and go LOW BIT RATE.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
About how far out are we now, Jack?
Okay, Aquarius. You're 150 000 miles and you're coming in at 4500 feet a second. That's from the Earth.
Okay. We're at 100 - Yes. 150 K, 4500 feet a second.
And, Aquarius, how much TTCA control did you have to do in the burn?
How much - What was that, Jack?
How much control of the TTCA did you have to do during the burn?
I wasn't noticing Jim too much. I'd say I put in maybe about six or seven inputs. I don't think it ever got off more than a couple of needle widths.
Roger, Fred. Thank you.
I think it's probably the same for Jim. I wasn't noticing his input but the - his needle was hanging in there pretty good.
Roger. Thank you, Fred.
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
I read you loud and clear, Jack.
Okay, Jack. What's your status, who's sleeping, and who's working?
Well, right now we're all three kind of working. Do you have any recommendations?
Yes, looks like to us from here that you and Fred ought to get some sleep, and that you ought to eat in about 6 hours. And that the Skipper ought to go to bed about 113 hours.
Okay.
I've got some other information. We shouldn't have some good dope on your trajectory for about 2 hours. Looked like to us that the burn was real good, however, and we're taking a close look at it, and we'll get back with you on that in about 2 hours from now. Another thing that we're expecting to have happen is that the SHe tank is going to reach its burst limit. The earliest time we predict this will happen will be at 107 hours on about 25 minutes. And the latest probable time is at 110 hours, and this is supposed to be a nonpropulsive vent, but you might hear it and you might see something.
Okay. That's good news. We were wondering about that. And I'll relay all the other information you gave me.
Okay. And if the SHe tank does burst during this time frame before we get trajectory info, why, that will delay our trajectory info somewhat. Your consumables, your water is now good through 152 hours.
Jack, wait a minute. Let me copy some of this down.
Okay.
Okay. I'm ready now.
Okay. We're predicting that you still have more water than you need. And one thing we'd like for you to do is when you're going to sleep up there in the command module take a look through the optics and see if you can see any stars.
Okay, Jack, I will do. Jim and I were able to spot constellations from the windows of the LM when there's no venting taking place. Could you give me some time on these consumables, what you're predicting they're good for? I think you started to give them times, didn't you, or was I just hearing things.
We started to give you some times. We think we might be able to give you some better ones pretty soon. But it looks like your water is good through 154 hours, and you've got takusan O<sub>2</sub> through 272 hours, plenty of lithium hydroxide, and your amp-hours ought to be good through 199 or 200 hours. Over.
Okay; good. Copy that.
We expect that your water rate is going to drop off and at the time, DELTA will go up to 160 - 165 hours quite shortly. Another thing we're interested in is what's your status on rest and medication.
Okay. None of us, I know of, had any medications, and right now as far as rest, I suppose we're no tireder than normally in this situation. I'm going to relay the work-sleep cycle.
Okay. And don't forget to look through the optics when you go up in the command module.
(Laughter) Okay. I'll do that.
Jack, as luck would have it, we just now started to vent a little from the command module ...
Aquarius, Houston. Sorry about that but there's too much background noise to read you. I think we'll have to wait until you come up on a new antenna. Over.
Okay, Aquarius. Go ahead now. I think I can hear you.
Okay. Okay, Jack. I was going to say, as luck would have it, the command module picked this time to start venting again, so I probably won't be able to get a good hack out of stars out of the telescope.
Okay. Thank you. And if you can think of it, when the time comes up, when you're not venting how about remembering to take a look through them and give us a word?
Okay. Will do.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead. Over.
Aquarius, Houston. Did you call?
Yes, Jack. I just got a question. How long are you predicting our command module canisters to last in here?
Okay, Jack. We've got 14 cartridges that'll last 157 hours, plus we've got the LM primary cartridge with 23 hours, and we've got two PLSS cartridges with 7 hours apiece.
Okay. I was just curious as to how much time we've got out of these two cartridges.
Stand by 1. I'll get a prediction on that. By the way, I hope you're keeping track of the ones you've used and the ones you've not.
Yes, right now, we have numbers 7 and 8 in the LM here.
Roger.
They were two brand new fresh ones.
Aquarius, Houston. In regards to the CO<sub>2</sub> canisters, by the way the PCO<sub>2</sub> is reading 1.6 down here now. We expect that we can get 6 more hours out of the two canisters that we have there - 6 hours at least. However, at 112 hours, when we've got several people up, we're going to rig up two more and we have the new simplified procedure for doing this. However, in the meantime, should we need to have a canister change, we plan to switch to the LM primary canister. Over.
Okay. Copy that, Jack.
And, Aquarius, how's your PTC holding up?
Well, we got a little bit off Jack. The - It starts high in the LMP's window and goes low in the CDR window.
So we've got a little bit of a wobble on it. Of course, the command module venting doesn't help, either.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Jack, in reference to your question about the PTC, on this last complete revolution, the Sun first appeared in the very top right corner of the LMP window, passed over the CDR window, and was visible through the overhead window, and now the Moon is - came pretty well through the center of both windows this last time.
Okay. Thank you, Jack. Copying that.
Aquarius, Houston. We'd like to get a little better idea of how PTC is going. So, what we'd like for you to do is what we did last time. That is to give us a reading on the center of the Earth and the center of the Moon on the - LPD.
On the LPD. Okay, It's shifted. Let's see, the Moon's gone by and the Earth didn't come into the LPD last time.
Okay. But when it goes by the plane of the LPD, tell us where it was. Okay?
Okay. Will do.
Okay, Jack. This pass, the Earth came into view at the top left-hand corner of the LMP's window and was going down. However, when it passed it wasn't as high up as the last pass. It did pass into view at the CDR window, but too high up to get an LPD reading.
Roger. Understand it went high in both windows then.
Yes, last time it wasn't even visible in the CDR's window; this time it was visible if you squatted down, but too high up to get an LPD reading.
Okay, Jack. That's good. Thank you.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
Go ahead. Over.
Okay. The moon came into view at the middle of the LMP's window, passed through the CDR's window at an LPD of 5 degrees.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay, Jack. On this pass, the Earth came into the view at the top part of the LMP's window, and we got an LPD angle on it as it passed through the CDR's window of a minus 4 degrees.
Okay. A minus 4. Thank you, Jack - -
It's - it's above the - Okay. Are you familiar with the minus 4 being halfway through the sky part, huh?
Affirmed.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. On this pass, the Moon came into view at the top part of the LMP's window, came across higher. Jim estimates the LPD angle at a minus 15 degrees.
Okay. A minus 15 on the moon, and sounds like it's set up pretty well.
Everybody's happy with it down there?
Aquarius, it's a little too early to tell exactly how the PTC is going. We'd like to get a few more points, so keep reading them off, and we're still looking for that SUPERCRIT to go anytime.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
The Earth was just fairly high in the LMP's window and across the 14-degree LPD line.
Okay, Skipper; 14 degrees. Thank you.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
The Moon went by the LPD at 6 degrees, plus 6 degrees.
Okay. Earth at plus 6. Thank you.
That's the Moon, the Moon.
Okay. The Moon. Thank you.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
The Moon passed by at a minus 8 degrees on the LPD. No, that's the Earth. The Earth passed by at a minus 8 degrees.
Okay. The Moon went by at a minus 8 degrees.
Okay, Jim. We got it. The Earth went by at a minus 8 degrees. On a basis of the data - -
That's right.
On the basis of the data we have so far, your entry angle is 5.99. The block data we gave you on the pad for a no-COMM midcourse-7 last night is no longer valid because we made this midcourse.
Okay. Understand, the no-COMM pad is no longer valid because of the midcourse. Entry angle based on the last 2 hours' tracking is 5.99, and I take it you're going to keep tracking for some time now to see whether we need another midcourse or not.
That's affirmative.
Are you planning any no-COMM midcourse at 134 and change anyway right now, or are you going to wait?
We're discussing that now, Jim, and it looks like we're going to wait on the tracking. For the time being, since you're in the corridor, why, there's no need to pass it up. But we're going to keep looking at the tracking, and we'll probably come up with one.
All right. I'm not too sure what the venting is going to do to us so - when this SHe tank ruptures, what it's going to do for us.
Roger. We don't presently expect the SHe tank to have any effect on your trajectory, and the pressure's up to 1921 now.
Hey, it's going a lot better than we ever expected. What a way to get a data point.
And, Jack, just think. You thought you were going to sleep through all your watches.
Say again, Jim.
I said, you thought you were going to sleep through all you watches.
Well, you keep waking me up.
Sorry about that.
Aquarius, Houston. You notice anything?
Yes, Jack. I was just about ready to call you. Underneath quad 4, I noticed a lot of sparklies going out.
Can you hear or feel anything?
No, I sure can't, but I think it changed our - it changed our PTC. Let me check and see what the drift is.
Okay. She's going down through 600 now.
I think we're probably going to have to reestablish PTC. Yes, we got pretty fast yaw drifting, Jack.
Houston, Aquarius. What are your plans?
We're thinking about them right now. Did you say it yawed some?
Yes, I was in a right yaw and now I'm in a left yaw; at a much faster rate than the one we put in PTC.
Okay, Jim. We're talking it over. Stand by.
What's the SHe tank down to now, Jack?
Okay, Jim. It's going through 125 pounds now. And we understood you to say - -
Okay.
- - that it reversed your yaw. Is that affirmative?
Sure did, Jack. It reversed my yaw completely and put in a little pitch, I think.
But more than anything, it reversed my yaw.
Roger. Have you effectively established PTC in the opposite direction then?
Well, you could say that. I'm not too sure just what kind of pitch or roll I've got, coupled with the yaw. I just saw the Earth go by the LMP's window here, not too long ago at a rather faster rate than we had going the other direction.
Perhaps you can tell how fast I'm having to shift OMNIs.
Yes, we can tell the COMM cycling back and forth.
Is that what they call a nonpropulsive vent?
Right. I'd hate to see a propulsive one.
You and me both.
It's going through 50 pounds now. So, are you seeing fewer sparklies?
Yes. Much fewer. Not any at all, now. I'm not sure whether that vent gave me reverse yaw and roll - left roll - that's - if that's what it gave me.
You say you think it might have given you some left roll as opposed to opposite yaw.
I'm sure it gave me the yaw, Jack, but I'm not too sure ...
Okay. We'd kind of like to watch it, see what happens for a little while before we make a recommendation. However, we'll need some inputs from you on that.
Well, we're in no trouble up here as far as - as far as the yaw goes. Everything's fine. It's faster than we had set up before. We just wanted to get into proper thermal constraint, and it's going to take me 15 minutes to get the thrusters up anyway.
Okay, Skipper. We don't see any thermal problems as a result of this change. If we see some communications problems, we may have to do something different, but so far, so good. And we'd kind of like to hear from you on LPD numbers, if you get anything going by the window.
Okay. Will do.
Okay, Jack. The Earth just went through at an LPD of 26 degrees.
Okay. The Earth went through at 26 degrees going the opposite direction this time - left to right. Is that right?
From left to right. That's affirmative.
Of course, the only other thing that we'd be concerned about is what change in your velocity this might have had and what DELTA-V it imparted, and we'll have to look at that for a while before we are able to determine it. And, if there is no significant change, why, we prefer just to leave it the way it is.
Okay, Jack. We're going to get a time on a revolution here, and maybe that'll help you out.
Right. And, for your information, the tank went at 1937.
That's two thousand - 1937?
Right.
Okay, Jack. The Earth went through again at 18 degrees on the LPD.
Okay. Earth at 18. Thank you.
Okay. And we didn't see the Moon that time.
Okay, Jack. The Moon went through that time at 32 degrees on the LPD.
Roger. Moon at 32. Thanks.
Okay, Jack. Well, we didn't get the Earth that time. The Moon came back through at about 10 degrees, and now we're getting to the Earth again. Stand by.
Okay. The Earth came through the LPD at 62 degrees that time. And the total time for the two revolutions, - I missed the Earth revolution before, but the total time for the Earth's two revolutions was 3 minutes and 50 seconds.
Say again the time and the - and also the LPD number. You're in the background noise, Jack.
Okay. Okay, Jack. LPD that time was 62 degrees and that was for two revolutions, being at that distance we missed the Earth - The time before we didn't see it. And the time was 3 minutes and 50 seconds.
Okay. Three minutes and 50 seconds. Is that rate uncomfortable for you?
Jack, Jim said it isn't uncomfortable. It's a little annoying as for the OMNI switching, and also he said it's kind of - He said this Earth/Moon relationship's kind of ... because he doesn't know when to ...
Roger.
Okay, Jack. We've got a MASTER ALARM and we've got a battery light flickering.
Okay. Copy a battery light. What battery?
Aquarius, how about cycling the power temp monitor to find out which battery it is, please.
Yes. That's in work, Joe.
Okay. It's that same old ...
Okay, Fred. I can hear you now, Say again, please.
Okay. It's the same old - same old one. The only light I'm getting is on BAT 2.
Okay, Fred. We copy your same old friend, battery 2. Could you give us high bit rate for a while, please?
Aquarius, Houston. High bit rate, please.
How you getting it now, Jack?
We got it.
Okay, Aquarius. You can go low bit rate, POWER AMP, OFF and DOWN VOICE BACKUP now. Voltages and currents look normal on battery 2; so ignore the battery light.
Okay, Jack. POWER AMP, OFF, back to low bit rate, and I'll go back to sleep.
The battery light staying on?
Yes. We got a steady on BAT 2, BAT FAULT LIGHT and the battery caution light.
Okay. And the Skipper in the sack now?
Say again?
Is the Skipper in the sack now?
Okay. Hold on a minute, Jack.
Aquarius, Houston,
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. Since the antenna switch is kind of annoying, we've talked them into buying only half of the data. If it gets too troublesome for you to switch antennas, why, just leave it on one antenna and we'll listen to you half of the time.
Okay. It's not really much trouble. That's all we're doing about it. We'll try to keep up with it. And you're satisfied with this attitude so far. I guess you're going to watch the thermal and find out whether perhaps we're going to some other PTC attitude.
Roger. Thermal appears to be no problem. We're looking at what DELTA-V might have been imparted due to this, and it looks like we're not going to change the PTC attitude.
Okay. Then DELTA-V was a part of it; I hope it raised that angle a little bit.
Yes. We'll be looking at the data here, and give you a better answer in next 30 minutes or so.
Okay. Meanwhile, back to the drawing board about nonpropulsive vents.
And, with your kind of luck, it probably lowered the angle some more.
Thanks for the confidence.
And, Jim, we're going to have a handover here pretty soon, about 3 minutes, we may lose uplink for 30 seconds or a minute.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. We're handed over. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear, Jack.
Okay. I'm hearing you now, and the noise has come up again, but it will go down.
How do you read now?
Okay. That's a lot better, and we figure your battery glitch was just that thermal switch triggered a mal - a CAUTION and WARNING, just cycled once, and triggered a MASTER ALARM again. We'll watch the batteries for you, since you don't have any CAUTION and WARNING on now.
Okay. Appreciate that.
Okay, Jim. Your luck is holding. Tracking shows that your entry angle has gone up to minus 6.24. This is on the basis of all the data we've collected between the midcourse up to the time the SHe tank went. So we'll continue to look at it, and see if SHe tank did anything to it at all. So it's - The data has gone from 5.9 to a minus 6.24.
That sounds pretty good. We're really getting in there.
How are you doing, Jim?
Not bad. Not bad at all.
Is Jack in the sack, or is he with you?
Jack and Fred both are going to sleep. It's sort of humorous; Fred's sleeping place now is in the tunnel, upside down with his head resting on the ascent engine. Jack is on the floor of the LM, with a restraint ... wrapped around his arm to keep him down there.
You say Jack is on the floor, and Fred is with his head on the ascent engine.
That's right, with his feet up into the tunnel.
Okay, Skipper. Your luck is really hanging in there. Your water's good up to 161 hours now.
Hey, that sounds great.
That doesn't include PLSS water or command module water.
Okay. Jack, I'd just like to know what - what plans or thoughts being contemplated for the PLSSs or the OPS, whether we're going to use their LiOH canisters or take the devices back in the command module with us, or just what will be your plans.
Yes. We're talking all that over now. We haven't decided.
Okay.
Everything's running real smooth over in Timber Cove, Jim.
Sounds pretty good. How about at El Lago?
Same. Everything's smooth there, too.
Good.
Jim, we've had a lot of people working on the entry procedures, and they'll be continuing to do so. We got a few ideas we'd like to toss at you so you can start thinking about them if you think you're in a position to discuss them without waking up the other guys. What do you think?
Yes, go ahead. It's okay.
Okay. One of the first things we want to do is charge the battery in CSM, so we can get some LM power over there to do that, and we have procedures ginned up to do it. In regards to reentry, we're planning our last midcourse at 5 hours before entry interface, and, if we have to make one, that is. And then we'd like to jettison the service module at 4 hours and a half, roughly, before entry interface, and take the next 3 to 3-1/2 hours for taking pictures, cranking up the command module G&N, taking care of stowage, and other odds and ends. And we'd hang on to the LM until 1 hour before entry interface, and then we'd jettison that. And these procedures are going to be run integrated in the CMS and LMS tomorrow morning, and, hopefully, later on in the day, we'll do it again with Mission Control on the loop. A couple of other things we'd like to toss at you: one question is what do we do with the OPS. The thought is that there is adequate O<sub>2</sub> in the command module and that the OPS represents high pressure source and a stowage problem, and people are thinking about leaving them in the LM. The other thing is that we think you might want to make this a suited entry, suiting up prior to LM jettison, because what we're doing is, when we jettison the LM, we're going to do it like we did in Apollo 10 - just let the beauty go, and if we weren't suited, why, we'd be betting on the hatch seal to take care of us. So we thought we'd toss these few ideas at you. Some of them are ones that are particularly pertinent questions at this time.
Okay. A suited entry would sort of ... the 1-hour LM jettison back and ... back and forth up to that time. ... impede our progress back and forth. ...
We're losing you, Jim
Okay. I think I've got you back. I guess the midcourse at 5 hours prior to ...
Affirmative, Jim. Midcourse 5 hours prior to entry interface.
If that's the case, all I'm worried about is having that all squared away. It's long before that ... I want everything in its place. All the stowage cleared away, all the ... ready to go and know exactly what to do and ... so that we can do the midcourse, and ... get into the command module ... jettison the service module, and then know exactly how to get into the LM.
Roger. All those procedures will work - will be worked out precisely, and we agree that the stowage and all of those peripheral details ought to be taken care of before midcourse.
And, I guess, that last midcourse, we'd want to start looking at midcourse fairly early, if we have the power to do so, mainly because of attitude control. This last time was fairly easy, but I'm not too sure how long we can continue to ...
I have ... in, and it seems about as cold as it is now, we'll probably be going into suits long before entry.
Yes. That's what we were thinking.
I guess the two things which are somewhat unresolved at the moment are what to do with the OPS and what to do about the suited entry. We thought we'd toss those at you to see what you thought about them.
Okay. As far as the OPS is concerned, we have enough oxygen in the spacecraft ... to get us through. I have no ... command module ... suit loop prior to entry. I was looking at ... OPS ... sources of oxygen ... also in the - in the front of the suit loop or ... circulate ...
Jim, I'm sorry. We're not catching what you're saying. The COMM is getting kind of bad right now.
Okay, Jack. How do you read now?
I've still got you with quite a bit of background noise, but if you talk up like that, I think we can hear you.
Okay. My only concern about leaving the OPS and/or the PLSS in the command module is how soon do we have to live off the command module consumables prior to entry, and the PLSS has a fan and has a lithium hydroxide ... use the command module system. Also, the OPS ... right now ... command module ... command module oxygen and electrical power is ... but I had just as soon be ... back in the LM.
It sounds like the general gist of your comments are that if things remain pretty much as they are now in the command module, you'd just as soon leave the OPS in the LM. Is that affirm?
That's affirm.
Okay. And maybe you'd like to think over the suited entry bit a little while.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
Okay ... How we aline the command module right for entry, especially if you have the LM in back. Over.
Roger. That's one subject that's been getting a lot of attention, and let me see if I can get some general ideas on that at the moment.
Okay.
Jim, I can give you the general idea of the proposed procedure for bringing the command module G&N up. It's the presently proposed one. We may come up with a better one, but here's what we're looking at right now. First thing we plan to do is to - using the LM COAS, sight on the Earth with the LM just as we did in the midcourse. Then we'll do a body-axis aline, 400 plus 5 on the ACS, to put the AGS ball at 000. And then we can give you an AGS ball attitude to fly to, to point the CSM optics at the Moon. And, if you can see stars, why, we can use those too. Then we can give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put into NOUN 20 and to torque the platform over. So, now we're coarse alined. Then we do a fine aline by shooting at the Moon and then at the Sun. Do you follow all that?
Okay, Jack. Let me see if I have it. What we do is point the LM at the Earth as we did for the midcourse COAS, and we do a body-axis aline on the AGS. Then you give us an AGS ball attitude to fly to. ... the LM, and then we ... point the ... at the Moon. Then you would update the - give us some CDUs to coarse aline. ... fine aline ... on stars or the Moon or the Earth. Stand by. Okay. We had another MASTER ALARM, Jack. I don't see any lights down there, except the battery light's still there. You want - - ... display ECS. Okay. And the number 2 battery still has a light on it. I suspect it may be the same problem that we had before ... ...
Okay. Let us talk it over a second, and we'll tell you what to do.
Jim, is the battery light kind of flickering?
Yes. That's affirm, Jack.
Yes. The battery light's flickering, and it triggers off the MASTER ALARM.
Okay. Well, that - temperature sensor on battery 2 is kind of cycling back and forth and every time it does, it triggers a MASTER ALARM, Jim.
Okay. Same old problem, huh?
Yes.
And, Jim, finally on the P52, we're considering using the - the Moon and then the Sun for the fine aline.
Okay. The Moon and the Sun for the fine aline. Understand. We'll go through this again here ...
Okay, Jack. Once - Once I get the spacecraft at the proper attitude ...
Jim, I didn't copy your last question due to background noise.
Okay. Once - Once you get the AGS ball alined ... command module ...
After we do the body axis aline on the AGS, we can tell you what attitude on the AGS ball to fly to in order to point the CSM optics at the Moon or at some star. And then we can, knowing where the optics are pointed, give you an equivalent set of CDU angles to put in NOUN 20 to torque the platform.
Okay. I see.
That's the current thinking. It may change between now and tomorrow, but right now, that's the way it looks, Jim. It'll probably be some take-off on that anyway.
Okay. Are they planning on a G&N entry or using another system, like EMS or something like that?
It will be a G&N entry.
Nothing like going first class.
Yes. That'll be a switch, won't it?
Jim, are you broken into the food locker in the LM yet?
That's affirm, Jack. I sure have. ... away.
You say you did find everything in order in there, huh?
Yes, everything was great.
Okay. I'll pass it.
I had a question about that earlier.
Right.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
I understand that one of your reasons for a suited entry is the fact that the command module hatch ... hasn't been good. It doesn't seem to be any different, but in the other ... our hatch is no better than other spacecraft.
No, the situation, Jim, is that your hatch is as good as any other hatch but that we won't have a chance to verify it until so late in the game, like 1 hour before entry interface, in this case; whereas before, why, we had a chance to evaluate it in lunar orbit. Over.
Oh, okay.
And that might make your time line a little too crowded, getting your suits on there at the last minute; say, less than an hour before entry interface.
Okay.
Jim, the next action item we want to pursue is transferring some LM power up to the command module MAIN B so we can start charging battery, and I guess what we ought to do is start on that one when somebody else gets up to help you there. So, when you decide to get the other guys up, or to have someone help, why, let us know and we'll start working on that.
Okay. I'll let you have Jack, and Fred's ... When in the time line ...?
Say again, Jim. I didn't catch that.
When in our time - What's the GET do you plan on ...
Jim, I didn't catch all of what you said, but I think you wanted to know when the procedures [on] entry are going to be available and read up to you. If that's the case, why, we're talking about 120 hours or so. As far as the - charging battery A, we want to do that as soon as the other guys get up to help you. We've already passed up some of that procedure, and we have a couple of DELTAs to it.
Roger. Jack's already up. He asked ... curious when you wanted to do it. Did you understand that? ... Is that correct?
Jim, we're having trouble hearing you. The next order of business is to charge battery A, and when you get somebody to help you there, why, we'll go ahead and get done with it.
Okay. Sounds good.
And, before you start working on it let us know, because we've got some DELTAs to the battery charging procedure.
Roger. I'm putting Jack on the line now to copy down the DELTAs ...
...
Aquarius, did you call?
Yes, Jack. I'm on the line. ...
Okay. Go ahead now. I can hear better.
Okay, Jack. Joe Kerwin passed me up the procedure for powering the CSM from the LM. Has it changed?
Yes. If you'll get that out, I'll read you the DELTAs.
Okay. I've got it.
Okay, The second step was in the LM circuit breakers panel 11 and 16: ASCENT ECA CONTROL, close, two of them. Cross that out. In the next line, we had BATTERY 5 NORMAL FEED, on; cross out BATTERY 5 and put BATTERY 6 in there. In the next line was - -
... Jack ... Hey, Jack; I have for step 3, I have BAT 5 and BAT 6 NORMAL FEED, on. You just want BAT 6?
That's affirmative. Just BAT 6, Jack. And the next line, you had BATTERY 1 and 3. Make that BATTERY 1, 2, 3, and 4. Just add BATs 2 and 4. All four descent BATs. And then the next two lines about waiting 30 minutes, cross that out. And the next line about BATTERIES 2 and 4 OFF/RESET, cross that out, too.
And, Jack, the - -
Okay. Let me read -
Go ahead.
Let me read you all the steps as I've got them, Jack, and make sure we've got them right. ... ASCENT ECA, two, closed. Step 2 will now be BAT 6, NORMAL FEED, on. Step 3, BATS 1, 2, 3, and 4, OFF/RESET.
Okay. That part's all right, Jack. And we had - about 11 or 12 steps for the command module. They go as is with no change. And then we had a couple of more procedures for the LM. Stand by 1.
Okay. Jack, let me read you command module procedures just to make sure I have them right, also.
Okay. Go ahead with the command module procedures.
Okay. Connect LM and CSM umbilicals. Step 2, panel 5: LM POWER 1 AC and 2 AC, closed, circuit breakers. Step 3, panel 5: EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, closed. Step 4, panel ... closed. Then there's step 5: MAIN B BAT BUS B, closed. Verify MAIN BUS voltage, then switch the LM power to CSM. Step 7: CB MAIN B BAT BUS B, open. And on panel 250, BAT POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, open. Verify MAIN BUS voltage.
Okay, Jack. The CSM procedure's okay, and then we had to go back to the LM and do something. And the first line is okay, cross out "BAT 5 and 6 OFF," delete that. And delete the next line also, that says "Panel 11 to 16 ASCENT ECA CONTROL, open." Then we had a couple of notes which remain the same. Go ahead.
Okay. I didn't get the notes, but I'll read you the steps as I have them now. One step, BAT 1, 2, 3, and 4 ... and at this point should have BATTERIES 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 ON. Is that affirmative?
That's affirmative. So now we have BAT 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, ON, and I got two notes. Number 1 is: your circuit breaker protection limits - your circuit breaker protection - limits the current to 15 amps. Number 2 note is: now the umbilical between the LM and the command module is hot. And the MAIN BUS voltage can be monitored by selecting MAIN B.
Okay, Jack. These notes are: circuit breaker protection limits current to 15 amps. The tube, the umbilical between the CSM and LM is hot. I can monitor MAIN B for the bus voltage.
That's affirm, Jack.
Okay, Jack. One question here. If we transfer power like this, we're not going to cut us short on power remaining in the CSM ..., are we ...?
Say it again, Jack. I didn't get it.
Okay. Stand by. If we configure the CSM for powering up the LM, we aren't going to cut it short on LM power requirements to get us back in the entry interface, are we?
That's a negative, Jack. According to the latest update, we've got ampere-hours out to 203 hours.
Stand by. ...
Okay, Jack. One question from Jim is, he wants to know whether the procedure has been tried ...
Okay. Try it again, now, Jack. What did Jim want to know?
Okay. He would like to know whether the procedure has been tried and whether it has been found to be okay; and there's no danger of shorting out any of our batteries or anything we have on board the LM now.
Okay, Jack. This procedure has not been tried out as such; however, the hardware paths through which the current flows are the same ones which we used during translunar trajectory, and there's not a problem with shorting out a descent battery. Over.
Okay. I'll relay that to Jim.
Jack, of course, the reason for all of this is that we see we're 20 amp-hours short on one of the entry batteries, and we've got to juice that up to get you home with.
Okay.
Okay. What we owe you from here on out is the actual battery A charge procedure, and then a procedure to turn this all around, again.
Okay. Do you have it there, and how long is it ...
Okay, Jack. I have the procedure in front of me. It's about 18 steps, and the reason it's so long is because we're starting from this basic configuration which we gave you earlier. It concerns a charge on battery A, of course, which is our low one. So, when you're ready to copy it, let me know.
Okay. Let's go at it.
Okay. Are you ready to read - copy it?
Go ahead.
Okay. On panel 250, circuit breaker BAT A, POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close; on panel 275, circuit breaker INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, close. Next several circuit breakers are on panel 5; circuit breaker BAT RELAY BUS, BAT A, close; circuit breaker EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC BUS 2, close; CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC2, close; CB BATTERY CHARGER, MAIN B, close. Are you still with me?
Okay, Jack. I'll read back those steps you gave me so far. Panel 250 CB BAT A, POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, close, panel 275, CB INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, close; panel 5, CB BAT RELAY BUS, BAT A, close; CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC BUS 2, close; CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC2, close, CB BAT CHARGER, MAIN B, close.
Okay. Good readback, Jack. The only one is number 1 - number 4. I didn't get your readback, but it's EPS SENSOR UNIT AC BUS 2, close. You got that?
Yes. I read that back CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, close.
Okay. To continue - to continue on - the same panel, panel 5: circuit breaker, BATTERY CHARGER, AC POWER, close; circuit breaker BATTERY CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE, close; circuit breaker INVERTER CONTROL 2, close; circuit breaker INVERTER CONTROL 3, close; I've got a switch for you, MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C, OFF; and another switch, BATTERY CHARGE to AC2. Read those back.
Okay, Jack. CB BAT CHARGER to AC POWER, close. Stand by. Okay. I had to get a light here. CB BAT CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE, close; CB INVERTER CONTROL 2, close; CB INVERTER CONTROL 3, close; the two switches, MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C, OFF; and the second one, BAT CHARGER TO AC2.
How about reaching over there on your right-hand side and turning the BIOMED off? See if we can improve the COMM a little bit.
Okay. How do you read, now?
Okay. I'm reading you real good now, and I want to verify that the main bus tie that we switched OFF was BAT Alfa Charlie.
That's verified; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT Alfa Charlie, OFF. And that should ...
Okay. And in panel 3, I've got a switch for you. AC INVERTER 2 to MAIN B.
Okay. AC INVERTER 2 to MAIN B.
Okay. And switch INVERTER 2, AC BUS 2 to on; and another switch, AC BUS 2 RESET, to reset and center; switch BATTERY CHARGE to Alfa; switch DC INDICATOR select BAT CHARGER; and then what we want you to do is to report the charger current and voltage to MSFN every 10 minutes for the first half hour, and then once every 30 minutes after that. And that'll be on our call, Jack. Read back the switches that I just gave you.
Okay, Jack. It's panel 3, AC INVERTER 2, MAIN B; INVERTER 2, AC BUS 2, on; AC BUS 2 RESET to reset and center; BAT CHARGER to A, AC INDICATOR select to BAT CHARGER. Report amps and volts to MSFN every 10 minutes for the first 30 minutes, and then every 30 minutes on a MSFN call.
Okay. That's a good readback, Jack. Now the only thing we owe you is a turnaround from this, which we will have.
Okay. Let me ask one question, here. About how long do you think it'll take to charge these batteries?
It's going to take you about 15 hours.
Jack, about how many amperes of LM power will this 15 hours ...?
Stand by. We'll get it for you - -
How many, Jack?
Okay. He got it. He got the question.
Okay, Jack. That's going to take 120 amp-hours out of the LM, which is equivalent to 10 hours, which will put us back to 193 hours, and that's plenty.
Okay. Let me relay that to Jim here. It'll be 120 amp hours, which leaves us - which puts us back from 203 hours ... to 193 hours.
Yes, there's that much to spare.
Okay, Jack. One question here. If we have any problems setting up this LM power to the CSM, is the quickest way to get out of it, return to the normal configuration, as it is for me to just switch the LM POWER to CSM to RESET then OFF?
Stand by 1.
I would like to give one quick step in case that gave Jim report some sort of problem for us to get out of it quickly.
Okay. Let us talk it over for a minute, Jack.
Okay. Real fine. And while you guys are talking it over, you might read back - have you got the procedure for reversing this? I'll copy that.
Okay, Jack. Are you with me?
Yes. We're still here, Jack. What we want to do is follow you through on this, so we're going to get high bit rate to do it. In answer to your question, to undo this procedure quickly, in the event a problem develops, be sure that you don't touch the 124 POWER switch because it's got a RESET position. But the way to undo it is go into the CSM and on panel 5 open two circuit breakers. And they're some of the first ones we read to you. Open LM POWER-1 MAIN B, and open LM POWER-2 MAIN B. You copy that?
Okay. Understand. If I want to get out of this real quickly, I have to open just two circuit breakers in the CSM; that's on panel 5, LM POWER-1 MAIN B, LM POWER-2 MAIN B.
Okay. And before you go ahead with this, let's establish high bit rate and wait 1 on that. And then as we go through the procedure we want you to wait when you get power on MAIN B so we can take a look at MAIN B without any loads on it before we start charging the batteries.
Okay. I understand you want high bit rate on the LM or CSM just before we start this?
That will be high bit rate on the LM, and stand by for it.
Okay.
Okay, Jack. Before we go ahead with this, what we want to do is read you the reverse - the normal reverse procedure.
Okay. I'm ready to copy.
Okay, Jack. I got the start on how you reverse this procedure. Ready to copy?
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. First you want to reverse the battery charge procedure. To do that, on panel 3, switch BATTERY CHARGE, off; AC INVERTER 2, off; panel 5, MAIN BUS TIE BAT Alfa Charlie, on, up; panel 250, circuit breaker BAT Alfa, POWER ENTRY, and POSTLANDING, open. Read back.
Okay, Jack. On panel 3, BATTERY CHARGER, off, AC INVERTER 2, off; on panel 5, MAIN BUS TIE Alfa Charlie, on; panel 250, CB BAT A, POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, open.
That's affirmative, Jack, and then if you'll go back to the rest of the circuit breakers on that list, and just opposite - Open them all up. Stand by 1.
Okay, Jack. Go back to the battery charge procedure I gave you. And, in order to terminate charge, just - You'll just have to write "Open" or "Off" next to the circuit switch that I gave you. So on panel 250, that circuit breaker you've already opened; on panel 275, INVERTER POWER-2 MAIN B, open; panel 5, BAT RELAY BUS BAT A, open; EPS SENSOR UNIT AC BUS 2, open, EPS SENSOR SIGNAL AC2, open; BATTERY CHARGER, MAIN B, open; BATTERY CHARGER AC POWER, open; BATTERY CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE, open; INVERTER CONTROL 2, open; INVERTER CONTROL 3, open; you've already done the MAIN BUS TIE; and then BAT CHARGE switch to AC 1. Over on panel 3, you have already set the AC INVERTER 2 to OFF and then INVERTER 2 AC BUS 2, OFF; AC BUS 2 RESET to OFF. You have already put the BATTERY CHARGER switch to OFF; and your DC Indicator select to MAIN B. Over.
Okay, Jack. Do you want me to read it back to you?
No, if you've got something in the right-hand column for all of those, we don't want to have to do it. And now one more thing I owe you is how to untransfer LM power to the CSM, and I'll get that for you in a jiffy.
Okay. I'll be standing by to copy it.
Okay. We have a last minute change to that.
Houston, 13.
Go ahead.
One thing I guess you probably all have considered it, but what heavy things can we store down there where the SRCs normally go to help increase our L over D?
I understand the question is what kind of heavy things can you store where the SRCs go.
Yes. They go down in the LEB underneath the computer, and the heavier things you have down there increases the L over D. We don't have any SRCs, so I was just wondering what heavy things - We could probably put some cameras, television cameras, things like that that normally pretty heavy down there in - that, in our SRC. No, we can't put the in our SRC, but we could put them in that container down there which would help decrease our L over D. Anything else you can think of would be greatly appreciated because we don't even have a throwaway station, so we're down a little bit in L over D.
Okay. Let me pass that question along, and get somebody working on it.
Souvenirs, I guess.
What souvenirs? (Laughter) All I've got is a Marine Corps foxhole-digging shovel.
You've got all you need then, buddy.
Okay. Ready to copy the power removal from the command module/LM umbilical.
I'm ready to copy. Go ahead.
Okay. This assumes that all the descent batteries are on line and ASCENT BATTERY 6 is on NORMAL FEED, as we said earlier. First thing you do is go in the CSM and look on panel 5 circuit breaker. LM POWER-2 MAIN B, open; LM POWER-1 MAIN A, open; circuit breaker EPS SENSOR SIGNAL MAIN B, open.
Hey, Jack.
Go ahead.
... You got just a little bit scratchy there because of the antenna problem. Let me read this back to you.
Okay. What I got, Jack, was the procedure assumes that all DESCENT BATTERIES are ON, and BAT 6 is on NORMAL FEED. Now we're going into the LM and on panel 5, we take LM, or CM LM POWER-2, MAIN B, open. And that's as far as I got.
Okay, the second one is on panel 5 also. Circuit breaker, LM POWER-1, MAIN A, open; circuit breaker EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open. Okay, read those back for the CSM, and I'll give you some steps in the LM.
Okay.
Okay. CB LM POWER-2, MAIN B, open; CB LM POWER-1, MAIN A, open; CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open. Stand by 1, Jack.
Jack, I don't think we ever closed CB LM POWER-1, MAIN A. We closed LM POWER-2, MAIN B, and LM POWER-1, MAIN B. Both of them on MAIN B.
Yes, you're right. Both of them should be MAIN B.
Okay. Copy that.
Okay. Ready to copy the LM?
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. On panel 16 circuit breaker, EPS, BAT FEED TIES, two, open; and now you've got to listen real carefully for high volts and low volts, BATTERY 1, HIGH VOLTS, to OFF/RESET; BATTERY 2, LOW VOLTS, to OFF/RESET and then ON: BATTERY 2, HIGH VOLTS, to OFF/RESET and then ON; BATTERY 1, HIGH VOLTS, ON; and then the circuit breaker on panel 16, EPS: BAT FEED TIES, both of them, closed. Read back.
Okay. On the LM side of the house is on panel 16. CB EPS BAT FEED TIES, two, open; BATTERY 1, HIGH VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET; BATTERY 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET then ON; BATTERY 2, HIGH VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET then ON; BATTERY 1, HIGH VOLTAGE, ON. Panel 16, CB BAT FEED TIES, two closed.
Okay. That's a good readback. It concludes the procedure going both ways and now we just have to stand by.
Okay, when do you plan to start this?
Darn soon.
Did you say not soon?
No, we're going to do it pretty soon, but we want to have high bit rate, and we don't want you to give that to us until we tell you.
Okay. I think I'll go back and try to undamp up there. Do you have anything more for the command module?
We're discussing two items, but we don't have them ready right now.
One of them, I hope, is a foolproof alinement procedure.
Okay, Jack. Just for curiosity's sake, does FIDO have any information as to whether that helium - that helium tank dump affected our trajectory at all?
Okay, Aquarius. Our tracking data shows that since the helium dump, our entry angle has not changed from its value of 6.24 and somebody calculated that if we had a propulsive vent, that helium could roughly, at the maximum, only impart a DELTA-V of a half a foot per second or less, anyway. But we're continuing to track and as soon as we get some more info, we'll pass it along.
Okay. That's swell, Jack. Thank you.
Sure.
Your 6.24 sounds good.
I'm still awake, I guess.
They said that it would be a while because they want to get high bit rate. They don't want to put high bit rate. ...
Okay, Aquarius. We're ready. So we want some high bit rate. To do that, go over to panel 16 under COMM and close the PRIMARY S-BAND POWER AMPLIFIER. On your COMM panel -
Okay. Okay, Jack. Wait 1. While - I'd like to get the whole crew up for this if you don't mind.
Okay.
... they're ready to start. Yes, you want to get Fred-o up.
We want to transfer some power - I want to go to high bit rate here first, then want to transfer LM power to CSM, Fred.
Okay, Jim, I'll give you the COMM.
Aquarius, there's no great big rush. If you want to let Fred come up to speed slowly, why maybe that'll help out
Okay. ...
And Houston, Jack is showing Fred the procedures before we start up.
Say again, Jim.
...
Aquarius, how do you read?
Loud and clear.
Okay. I'm hearing you now. I think I missed your last transmission, Jim.
Okay. Jack is showing Fred the procedures. Want to get him familiarized with them, and how to get out of any problems before we proceed.
Roger. No rush. Just let us know when you're ready. We don't want old Fred-o to slip a gimbal there.
Yes. We're watching him.
Boy, if you took 120 hours out. Oh. ... Okay. ...
Houston, Aquarius.
Hello, Fred. Go ahead.
Okay, I guess the only question I have is in the first - the very first portion involving the LM here where it has me turn on the only BAT 6, and then turn off all the DESCENT BATTERIES. Are you still reading me?
Okay. I read you until after turn off BAT 6 - Correction, turn on only BAT 6.
Okay, the question is "Only one ASCENT BATTERY BAT 6 on the line," immediately followed by turning off four DESCENT BATs. Is that correct?
That's affirmative, Fred. That question has been banged around and we decided to go that way.
Let's see, we will be powering other BUS via the CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS breaker. Is that correct?
That's affirmative, and we're reading a current of 11 amps right now.
Okay. Okay. I guess I'm ready, then. That's 11 amps?
And after you turn BAT 6 on the line, you might as well take a look at the BATs 1 through 4 and so forth, and make sure that it's okay to turn them off.
Roger. Are you ready, gang?
Yes, we're ready for the POWER AMPLIFIER and the HIGH BIT RATE, and NORMAL VOICE, on the FUNCTION switch, please.
Okay.
Okay, gang; we've got the HIGH BIT RATE, now.
Roger.
Okay, we see BAT 6, ON, and it looks good, Fred-o.
Okay. Am I cleared to proceed with the next step, getting 1, 2, 3, and 4, OFF/RESET?
Affirmative. You're cleared for BATs 1 through 4, OFF/RESET.
Okay.
Okay. Still looks good.
Okay, Houston. We need a call from you when to have Jack to proceed up into the Odyssey and start up there.
Okay, Aquarius; and Jack can get with it right now.
Okay.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. We've completed the powerup and things look good upstairs. Are we GO for proceeding with battery charge?
Okay, Aquarius; you're GO on the battery charge.
Roger.
Boy, this is really a switch, isn't it, Jack?
That's an understatement. You're not known for that.
Yes. I think if you add up the - Yes - if you add up the operating time, I think the LM beats the CSM by a considerable margin on this flight.
Grumman just hired you.
Yes.
You're out there at 134000, coming in at about 4900 feet a second.
Very good.
The SUPERCRIT tank went off at about 1937, just about like expected.
Yes. It - it also must of not did very much, except the rates. I was asleep then and I didn't hear a thing.
Is the command - service module still venting?
Jack said it was just before he went up. Right now, the Sun's over there, and I can't really tell - -
And - -
We asked him a long time ago if he was able to see any stars out the optics. I don't think we ever got an answer.
Okay.
That's a pretty good sleep station I had rigged up, Jack. I took one of the sleep restraints out of the command module, zipped up in it, and then hooked the tie, right at the top of the zipper, onto the LM upper hatch handle. So it kind of held me there, and then just drifted up in the tunnel upside down with my face toward the hatch, so the sunlight didn't get in my eyes and that worked pretty good.
Did you sleep pretty well that way?
Yes, no problem at all.
Is Jim sleeping that way now, or is he standing next to you?
He's standing next to me.
About time for him to go to bed.
Okay. The voltage upstairs is 34.3 and the charger is reading 2.5 amps.
Okay 34.3 and 2.5. And ... says ... - -
- - pretty cold. Good.
Say again your last.
They came - both came down here rubbing their hands, shivering. It's pretty cool upstairs.
Are you keeping warm in the LM?
Yes. It's pretty reasonable down here.
Okay. And right now, it looks like ... right now, it looks like the command module isn't venting, Jack, so I'm going to try to take a look at the optics.
Okay. You say it is not venting?
Yes. That's the word. We've just looked through the AOT and you can't see anything back there.
Okay. And everything's fine in El Lago.
Very good.
Aquarius, we're ready to secure the high bit rate.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius; how do you read?
I'm hearing you with a lot of background noise, Fred-o.
Okay. How now? I just switched OMNIs again.
Aquarius, could you get a - amps and volts readout from Odyssey, please?
Okay. Stand by.
The CMP is dotting across there. You'd be amazed at how proficient you get at transfering to the tunnel after the first 1000 times.
I didn't get your last there, Fred-o. We'd like you to verify that your POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker is open.
Okay. That's verified. POWER AMPL breaker is open.
Roger.
Okay, Jack; that's 34.6 volts and just a little bit under 2.5 amps.
Okay, Fred. I copied 2.5 amps. Say again the volts, please.
34.3 and that was just a little bit below 2.5.
34.3; thank you.
Okay. ... point ...
Fred-o, I didn't copy the last. Say again the voltage, please.
Okay, and the voltage is 34.6 - 34.6, amps, slightly less than 2.5.
34.6 and a little below 2.5. Thank you.
We're - the way we are torquing around to the side here, Jack - We are getting some intervals where I can't hardly get to it with either of the OMNIs.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Hous- Aquarius.
Okay. Jack reports from upstairs that he can see stars and constellations out of the optics but the Sun angle is such that it is reflecting off the LM - portion of the LM quad and other thruster ... right now. ... really moving around ...
Okay. The part I got was that he can see stars and constellations and there is some sunlight reflected off the quads. That's all I got.
Yes. The point being that, at least in the present orientation, you have to kind of wait until Sun isn't reflected off the LM to see them.
Okay. What you're saying is you kind of have to wait until the - there is no Sun reflection on the LM to see the stars. Is that right?
Yes. That's for the present orientation, of course.
But later on, if you can stop it moving around and ... ...
Okay - -
...
Okay, Fred-o. And we need a volts and amps reading.
Okay. And bring it back upstairs.
Okay. The volts, 35.0; amps, 2.4.
Okay. 35.0 and 2.4. Thanks, Fred.
The weather prediction for your landing area is still good; 2000 scattered, high scattered; 4-foot seas, 15-knots wind. There's a hurricane 500 miles to the west, which doesn't pose a problem.
A hurricane or a typhoon?
Delay my last. It's degraded to a tropical storm.
Aquarius, Houston. We need another readout amps and volts, and that will be our last one for a half hour. Over.
Okay. The reading is 37.8 volts, 2.3 amps.
Say again, Fred.
37.8 volts, 2.3 amps.
37.8 and 2.3. And that will be our last one for a half hour. Thank you. And I'm about to exercise my fifth general order here, and pass it along to Joe.
Yes. It must be getting around a mealtime.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
...
Okay. This is your friendly do-it-yourself-kit COMM with a suggested procedure in the lithium hydroxide situation. You're looking good. We read 1.8 millimeters, and you do have sufficient LM ... to last you the rest of the flight. However, being on the conservative side, we would like to use one more set of command module canisters to guard against some possible problems with the LM, primary canister. And I have a simplified procedure for doing that, if you want to listen to it now. Over.
Okay. I think I read that you were ready. I forgot ... earphones. This simply consists of getting a second pair of cartridges out of the command module, putting one band of sticky tape, that is the gray tape, with the sticky side out, around the sides of each new canister near the top, taking a piece of EVA cue card and cutting it into four squares about 2 or 3 inches on a side, bending those at a right angle to form corner support, attaching them to the sticky tape, so that they'll stick up and overlap the old canister, and then simply putting the old canister next to the new canister and taping it up real good so it sticks together. The only other procedure is to remove the towel plug from the old cartridges and put it in the bottom of the new cartridge. And that's it. Over.
Okay. As I read you we get the gray tape and fold it so that we get - the back sticks around the outside of the canisters, then we mount to that four sides of our ... cards like our EVA ... cards; then we overlap those cards down around the base of the canister. Then we - then we ... over the ... at the top. ... Then we take the towel from the old ones and put them in the bottom of the new ones. ... ...
Okay, Fred. I think you got it. I didn't completely copy your readback, but it's just that simple. We're just putting the new cartridge - the top of the new cartridge against the bottom of the old one, moving that towel plug, using the cue cards as little corner stiffeners, and taping her up.
Okay. The top of the new against the bottom of the old.
Roger that. That way you don't have to touch the hose.
Hey, for a change, I took the ... LM ... this morning, Joe.
Okay. Go ahead.
I got ...
I'm afraid I didn't copy that, Fred, and while I was listening, EECOM told me that he'd like another battery charge ... readout.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
You want us to start on this lithium right now, Joe, or is it necessary?
It's not time-critical, Fred, but if you have the people awake now, you might go ahead and do it. Incidentally, you probably know this, but the next several hours are going to be pretty quiet from our point of view. We're working on the entry procedures and should be ready to read them up to you in about 8 hours; and between now and then there's not an awful lot going to be going on, so you guys could be catching up on your sleep schedule. Over.
Okay, Joe.
And we would like another readout on the amps and volts.
Roger.
Okay. The volts, Joe, are 38.9 and the amps are 1.9.
Okay. Copy that, Fred. Thank you very much; 38.9 and 1.9. And EECOM is simply making as smooth a plot as he can to verify the amount of amps we're putting back into the battery. That's why he wants it at half-hour intervals. If that schedule begins to interfere seriously with your rest cycle or so, give us a call. Over.
Okay.
Yes. Jim's sleeping now, and Jack and I are awake and I just finished sleeping around, I guess, about another 5 or 6 hours, so I'm not particularly inclined to go back to sleep right now.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Okay. We've got one of them ready to go, and it looks like we could do a pretty good job just using the tape strips. First combining them together and then just using a piece of paper and the bag ... get a pretty good seal ...
Hey; okay, Fred. We suspected that you'd gotten at least one on. We've noticed a partial pressure drop from the 1.8 to 0.8, which is real good.
Okay. You might run that by the CPCB and see if they approve our in-house ...
Roger that.
Aquarius, Houston.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger. We're convening the CPCB on that change, Fred, but FLIGHT has given you an interim go-ahead. Over.
Okay.
And, how do you read now?
Not too bad, Fred.
Okay. We've got both canisters completed now.
Okay. Roger that, Fred. And you're reading 0.1 again on the CO<sub>2</sub>. Incidentally, are you guys having good luck getting water out of the command module?
We - We haven't tried that yet today.
Okay.
Yes. This is quite an apparatus hanging on to these hoses now. And that ECS design engineer ... because it sure seems to work.
Roger that.
And, Aquarius, Houston. At your convenience, we'd like another volts and amps readout.
Okay.
How do you read, Joe?
Pretty good, Fred.
Okay. Volts, 39.0; amps, 1.7.
39.0, 1.7. Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead. You're pretty weak.
I didn't call you, Joe.
Say again.
I didn't call.
Oh, sorry about that. Incidentally, Fred, if switching OMNIs every couple of minutes bugs you, you can skip it for now. We can always wait until you come around.
No, it doesn't. This is Jack, Joe. Fred ... It doesn't bother me at all.
Okay.
Just happy to know that you're standing by.
Roger that. Except I'm sitting by.
Did that CO<sub>2</sub> drop?
Joe, how far out are we now and how fast are we closing?
Okay, Jack. The plot shows you about 130 000 miles out, which is about, gee, 10 000 closer than you were when I came on a couple of hours ago. And let me check with FIDO for your rate of closure.
Hey, Jack. Over.
Go ahead.
Your smiling FIDO says you're making 5040 in a 5000-mile zone
I can't ... I ...
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger, Jack. Hate to keep bugging you, but we would like another volts and amps reading. Over.
Okay. We'll get it for you.
Good show.
Joe, did our sticky MOD on that - those CO<sub>2</sub> canisters work? I'm sorry - ...
Jack, I think you asked if the canister MOD was working and the answer is, it sure as hell is.
Okay, Joe. I got the voltage. It's 39.0 amps and 1.75.
Copy 39.0 and 1.75.
Houston, do you read Aquarius?
Aquarius, Houston. That's affirmative.
Okay. We had a dropout there for a few minutes. ... on either antenna.
Gee whiz, Jack, I - when did it happen? Over.
Just now. I just got you back.
Okay. We had a handover, but that was about a half an hour ago, and I didn't call you on it. Let me check with INCO and see if he thinks everything's okay. Your COMM sounds just as good as it's ever been.
Yes. I'm in real good shape.
Jack, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. We're checking into it. We think we lost lock in Madrid for a while, and we've got it back now.
Okay. Real fine ...
Okay.
You might also check with FIDO whether we ... perigee ...
You're getting a little weak. Did you say you wanted to verify what - what your vacuum perigee is? Over.
Yes. ...
Jack, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. The good FIDO gives us a vacuum perigee at the present time of 23.6 with a flight path angle of minus 6.25 degrees. That's without a midcourse. He's kind of tossing around the idea of doing a midcourse-7 maneuver at 5 hours before entry. If we do it, it looks like it won't be more than 2 feet per second. Over.
Okay.
And, Jack, Houston. We verified that that COMM problem was a ground problem.
Okay. Thank you. That FIDO is really cooking today.
Oh, he's having a ball.
It must be because we haven't made any waste water dumps.
(Laughter)
You can tell Jay and David that I went for a whole flight and didn't use the bathroom.
(Laughter) He copies that. David's here; he says you've kept him so busy he hasn't had time to work on his stereo all week.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Jack, we'd like another volts and amps reading at your convenience.
Okay, Houston. It's 39.2 volts; 1.6 amps.
Okay. Thank you. We copy; 39.2 volts, and 1.6 amps.
Right.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
I just relieved the watch; just thought I'd find out how things are going.
Okay, Jim. Good morning; and understand you relieved the watch, and the rest was kind of blurry. Did you have any questions?
No questions, Joe. Just ...
Okay. That was - That was loud and clear, that one there. Now we don't have a heck of a lot going on as you know we're working on the entry procedures. I've got preliminary copies, but we're not ready to pass - to pass it up to you. Looks like you're about 125 000 miles out, starting to - starting to really pick up speed, and the Astros won last night, and that's about all I've got. Over.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. It's about time, at your convenience, for another volts and amps reading on the command module. For your information, we put 6 amp-hours back in the battery already and we've got about 14 to go. It's looking real good, and I also just got the word that the entry weather tomorrow is looking better all the time. Really looks great.
That's good. When I went to bed last night, ... a lot of rain ...
Couldn't copy that, Jim. Sorry.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. 39.2 on the volts; 1.4 on the amps.
39.2 and 1.4. Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger. Just for your information, in case it happened when you were off watch, the master caution circuit breaker is still pulled, and we're seeing the - the malfunction indication on the descent battery now, but all the parameters still look just as good as ever, and that's just for information.
Okay. I see the battery light flickering now.
Okay. Recommend you ignore it.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, it's volts and amps time again, at your convenience.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. If you gave me those readings, I didn't copy them. Over.
Houston, Aquarius. Do you read?
Aquarius, Houston. Okay; go ahead.
Volts, 39.3; amps, 1.25.
Okay. Copied 39.3 and 1.25. Jim, did Jack tell you what your trajectory looks like? Over.
Haven't got up to ... on it. How about giving me a rundown?
Okay. We are looking at a vacuum perigee right now of 23.6; flight path angle of minus 6.25; and if we decide we want to trim that up, we're looking at a midcourse of about 2 feet per second. Your consumables, of course, are getting better all the time; we've got 163 hours of water, 230 hours of oxygen, and 172 hours worth of electrical power. Over.
That sounds good.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. We would like to get another check from you on the propellant tank temperatures, as we did yesterday. And the procedure is to, on panel 16, circuit breaker PROPELLANT, DISPLAY/ENGINE, OVERRIDE/LOGIC to close. Then go to your display and read the tank 1 and tank 2 temperatures for us, and then open the circuit breaker again. Over.
Okay. I'm closing now - the DISPLAY/ENGINE, OVERRIDE/LOGIC.
Roger.
Okay. And the reaction control temperatures are 65 in A and 65 in B.
Okay, Jim. We'd like the descent tank temperatures, too. Over.
67; oxidizer is 63; descent tank 1 ... is 64; the oxidizer is ... Did you copy? Over.
Hello, Houston. Did you copy the - the DPS display temperatures?
Jim, I copied 63 and 64, which I think were the descent 1 temps, and that's all I got.
Okay. I'll go over it again. I'm on descent 1, now and fuel is about 64, and oxidizer is 65, and I'll go to descent 2 - -
Okay. Thank you very much - -
- - our descent 2. Okay. I've got descent 2 now right up on 67 and 66.
Roger. We copy that, and once again we'd like to get the volts and amps check in the command module. Over.
Okay. I'm going to go up there and get it. Jack is - and Fred are asleep, so I'll be off the air a minute.
Okay. Real good.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
Volts, 39.3; amps, 1.2 zip.
Okay. We copy 39.3 and 1.20. And, Jim, I've got one more item for information for you. At - In about 45 minutes or so, you will get an H<sub>2</sub>O quantity caution light on the descent tank. We expect this. It occurs at 16 percent. And it's no problem, because we intend to run the tank dry just for drill. To reset the - the light, on panel 2, just set the O<sub>2</sub> H<sub>2</sub>O QUANTITY MONITOR to the CAUTION/WARNING RESET position and the light will go away. Over.
Okay. I understand. We're going to get a H<sub>2</sub>O warning light here shortly, and I'll reset it.
Okay. Good deal.
Houston, Apollo 13.
Aquarius, Houston; go ahead.
Okay, Joe, we got the WATER warning light.
Okay. Roger that.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. The experts would like another volt and amp reading.
Okay; have them stand by.
Okay, no rush.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston; go ahead.
Voltage is 39.3, amps 1.26.
Copy 39.3 and 1.26.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston; go.
Joe, you might pass to our friends in Crew Systems that lunar boots make great footwarmers.
I guess you need them up there, too. Is - is anybody sleeping in the command module right now, Jim?
Negative, Joe. It's just too cold in there. I got Fred stashed over here to my left. He's asleep and Jack's ...
Roger.
You can eliminate the chilldown procedure for reentry.
(Laughter) Well, we figured we were in that mode now.
Aquarius, this is Earth. Over.
Go ahead, Earth; Aquarius here.
Roger. Earth is here, also; and, Jim, it is time for another one of those volt/amp checks. For your information, we've got that battery back up to 30 amp-hours now. Over.
Hey, that sounds great. Jack's gone up to check it.
Roger.
Aquarius, Earth.
Go ahead.
You know, I think Aquarius is ...
We've got garble now, Jim; I'm sorry.
I said Aquarius ...
Roger.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
Voltage 39.3, amps 1.26.
Okay. Copy that, Jim.
Jim, Houston. Have you guys put on any extra clothes to try and ward off the nip of Jack Frost? Over.
Well, the lunar boots and two pair of underwear, and everyone is ... crawl into their sleep restraints.
Yes.
We're a little reluctant to break out the suits.
Yes, that's understandable. You can always use them if you have to. I guess it's pretty hard to get extra coveralls on, huh?
Well, Joe, I didn't think we had any extra inflight garments aboard, but we're going to check right now.
Well, stand by.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Jim, we noticed you just went to AUTO and back to CLOSE on the SUIT RELIEF valve. Is everything okay?
We didn't do that intentionally. Stand by.
Okay, maybe you didn't. Incidentally, you're less than 24 hours to go.
Roger. What happened was, our lithium hydroxide device here got caught in the suit relief valve. It is closed now. That's where you want it, right?
Okay.
Okay.
And, Joe, just a reminder; now that you mention it - that it's less than 24 hours to go, what I'd like to do, and I have aboard all the procedures that you are working up; so I can run through them with the crew, and make sure that we get all our signals straight.
Roger that, Jim. We are trying to get the procedures finished and up to you as quickly as we can. They exist. What's going on now is the guys are running them in the CMS/LMS, integrate, to make darn sure that the attitudes are correct and the time line is nice and relaxed and all that good stuff. And they won't be finished that run for another few hours. However, we expect to have an overall time line and a sequence of events for you before that time, and we'll start with the procedures as soon as they get ready. Over.
Okay. That's good. I think ... ought to go back to the original procedures we have on board and modify them as we have the time to.
Okay, Jim. Roger. We're going to do that to the maximum extent possible. And it looks reasonably feasible. To begin with in the command module we're going to have to send you some separate sequences for powering it up a little bit at a time. The closer we get to entry the more we get on the checklist. By the time we're about at EI minus 45 we're on the checklist all the way.
Okay.
And just as a reminder, don't forget our stowage problem. We - We still have to do quite a bit of stowage of the drogue and probe in the LM, and, et cetera.
Roger that. We've got a team working on that, and incidentally, one of the information items that they want to know is which lithium hydroxide containers in the command module are empty. They just want to know that for weight and balance - and there's no rush about it - -
...
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Another note of interest to the crew systems people - Tell them that they don't have to bother putting the refrigerator onboard. I just brought out some hot dogs, and they're practically frozen.
(Laughter) Okay. We copy that, Jim.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like another volt, amp reading, Jim.
Okay. Stand by, Joe.
Roger.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
Volt 39.4, amp 1.23.
Okay. Roger that. And, Jim, we ought to have a - an entry time line to discuss with you in one hour.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Guess what.
What?
Your volts and amps time, Jim.
That goes like the Amos and Andy show.
Houston, Aquarius. Guess what.
Aquarius, Houston. What? Over.
39.4, 1.27.
Are you really going up there, and looking at them?
That's what the meters say.
Okay. We copy, Jim.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. We show the SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF valve is back in the AUTO position, and we'd like to have it off for good scrubbing. Over.
Have you seen ... out there?
Okay. Thank you, Jim.
... up there - about ... of the scrubbers. If you think ...
Roger. No sweat. Jim, in a few minutes I'm going to be coming at you with the - with the overall time line for tomorrow morning. You might want to think about taking a few notes, although we don't have detailed procedures for you at this time. Maybe you want to have Fred or Jack listen. Over.
Right. We're all set to copy.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
For our benefit while we do this briefing, Jim, we'd like to have the, the COMM better, and we can sure spare the power; so we'd like you on panel 16 to close the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker, and on panel 12 we'd like you to move the VOICE FUNCTION switch to VOICE. Over.
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear.
Okay, and you're real good. It's a - It's a pleasure not to have all that noise. Let me tell you what I want to do, Jim. As I said, we're not going to give you detailed procedures, now. What we expect to have for you shortly are procedures which we'll try and get up to you in the following form. First, we'll have a time line, sort of a flight plan thing, which will have the times of all the major events and any configurations, switch settings, and so forth which are peculiar to our configuration and which, therefore, you won't find in the checklist. This, for instance, will be true of the way we power up the command module; and second, of course, we'll have any redlines to the checklist so that you can enter the checklist where possible to - to perform functions, and the time line will simply refer you to the checklist when that's appropriate. Okay?
Okay. Sounds good. You're going to give me an overall time line now, I take it; is that right?
That's affirm. I'm going to first of all just quickly run through the times of the major events, and then we'll go back and fill in some of the details. Okay. Entry interface is at 142 hours 40 minutes; 6-1/2 hours, roughly prior to that or at about 136:10, we'll start this whole thing going by applying IMU HEATER POWER, by checking the CM/RCS temperatures and preheating the CM/RCS if required, and we suspect we'll probably want to do that. We'll have detailed procedures up for it later. At about 6 hours prior to EI or about 136:40, we will commence powering up the LM, powering up the AGS, using the modified LM/DPS RCS 30-minute checklist, which you have used for the previous midcourse. Then shortly, just before 5 hours, prior to EI or at about 137:49, we'll want you in the attitude for a LM AGS body axis alinement, using the Earth terminator like we did before; and as soon as we have that, we'll perform MCC-7, which looks like, now, about a 2-foot-per-second burn or about 15 seconds of RCS. And I'm told that it's down to 1-1/2 now, so it's comfortably within the RCS margin. Okay. When we do that, we'll immediately start the maneuver to the service module jettison attitude, which will be in plane since we're jettisoning it earlier than we usually do. We don't need, and don't want, the out-of-plane component. So it'll be in plane with the service module pointed back out along the radius vector. We will then commence to get the command module ready for service module SEP, including command module RCS checkout and hot fire, and at approximately 4 hours and 30 minutes prior to EI or 138:10, we'll jettison the service module. We'll pitch the LM up until we aquire the service module in the ... and try and get some photographs, but we're not going to fool around with LM translation maneuvers for pictures because we don't want to screw up - foul up your flight path angle at that time. Okay. That gives us 2 hours to - of more or less open time here to finish up, if we're late on that, to go on over to checklist and prepare for powering up the command module. We're going to start the command module full powerup at EI minus 2 hours and 30 minutes or 140:10 GET. We'll get the computer on the line, we'll get the IMU up, we'll start uplinking your state vectors, and so forth, and alining the command module platform. At about 1 hour and 30 minutes at the latest, giving us an hour to do this command module stuff, we will start the maneuver to the LM jettison attitude. You'll then start to close out the LM. Of course, we don't have our stowage all configured way before this. We'll close the hatch, do a pressure integrity check, and at EI minus 1 hour, or 141 hours and 40 minutes, we'll jettison the LM. As soon as we do that, you can start the maneuver to the entry attitude. When you're there, do a sextant star check, take down the optics, and at that point we'll be giving you your final entry pad. You can initialize the EMS, and you'll essentially be right back on the checklist at that point. There's one - one little difference from your nominal entry. You're a little bit earlier in the morning, so it going - it's going to be nighttime when you get to EI. However, we're fortunate enough to have the Moon in a perfect position for a horizon check. We'll give you a Moon check instead of a horizon check, and you can track it right down to moonset, which is going to be at EI roughly minus 3 minutes. And that's it for the quick time line. Do you have any questions right now?
I don't believe so, Joe, right now. We'll have to look at those time lines, and think about it for a little bit.
Okay. Real fine. We're ready to talk in some more detail about the alinement procedures, the CM powerup procedures, and so forth, but why don't we give you a few minutes to digest what you've already heard.
Houston, Aquarius
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Two questions so far on heating up the CM/RCS. We assume that's LM power, and we assume that we're going to have to power up both CM buses, right?
Okay, Jim. I didn't want to talk about that because we're not quite ready to recommend a procedure. We can't power up the CM/RCS per the normal checklist on the LM power because we haven't got quite enough amps. It may be that we'll want you to heat - to do the preheat one ring at a time and we're looking at that. Another possibility is that we may want to take down LM power at that, time, do the preheat, and then go back to LM power until we have to take it down finally. Over.
Okay. Understand. second question: when we finish MCC-7, that maneuver to SM JETT attitude will be angles given to us, by you, using the AGS aline ball, right?
That's affirmative. Once we get that AGS alined and get a time hack on it, the good people down here will be able to give us AGS - AGS, 8-ball attitudes for the service module separation attitude, for the command module alinement attitude, which we are going to pass you up the - a Moon/Sun P52-type alinement. We'll have AGS 8-ball attitudes for those, and we'll be able to uplink through the command module once we get the computer up a preferred REFSMMAT, which will be identical to the LM attitude, at the time of the burn. And we'll go into the details on that later.
Okay. Just stand by 1. I'll give it to you.
Will do.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
We would like to have plenty of ... the control characteristics are of the LM/command module, and whether we can use the attitude control - controller only to maneuver the combination to photograph the service module at 4 plus 30.
Okay. Good thinking. We are - it's - There has been a lot of consideration of what kind of maneuvers to let you do to photograph the LM, I mean the service module. We consider it quite low priority; the feeling is that it will be real nice to get pictures of the service module, but they are not required for our troubleshooting program. As far as the - the attitude control authority, and so forth, we will get you more detailed word on that later; we are working it. It appears that using the ACA instead of the TTCA after service module JETT will give you excellent attitude control authority, and that's what we recommend.
Okay. And I'm ... - use an AGS ATT HOLD configuration to keep the attitudes - turn the LM JETT attitudes.
That's affirm. We are - We are probably going to recommend a tight deadband AGS attitude hold for that.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
Okay. The star check at the entry attitude, is it a sextant star check or a COAS star check?
It'll probably be a sextant star check, Jim. It really depends on how good that platform is that we get. And we expect it to be plenty good enough for a sextant star check.
Okay.
While we are on that subject, Jim, I want to mention one thing to Jack. As I said, this CSM alinement procedure we are going to recommend is a Moon/Sun, and there are Sun filters stowed; they are stowed in compartment R-1; however, they are for the telescope only, of course, not the sextant. One is for the long eye-relief piece, the other for the normal eyepiece. And if he has any questions about that, we'll be glad to talk about it.
Okay.
And because it will be too late to do much about a hatch integrity check if it fails, you want us to have our suits on sometime during this period?
Okay, Jim. We are laying for you on that one; it is a subject that we wanted to - to bring up with you. We have been considering it, and our feelings are - Of course, it is up to you, but as we see the pros and cons, you just put your finger on the pro. We do a hatch integrity check shortly before EI minus 1 hours, and if we bust it, you would have a hard time scrambling into the suits. On the other hand, the disadvantages of wearing the suits are that they might slow you down considerably, not even counting the time to don them, and someone is even very concerned that after such and such a period of time in the suits, you might get too warm, and we might have to power up the SUIT LOOP to ventilate the suits and we don't particularly want to do that because it cost quite a bit of power. Consequently, our recommendation was going to be that you not wear the suit, since we have no reason to believe that the integrity check will show us anything but a slightly increased leak rate, and we can certainly hack that. What do you think? Over.
Well, I have confidence in the hatch, as long as it goes in and locks in smoothly; I see no reason why we need the suits, and one thing we are going to do during our spare time is to practice putting that hatch on, make sure we get it on and locked.
Okay. Real good. And with that precaution, think we can concur on that decision.
And that's all the questions we had about the time line you gave us.
Okay. Let me take a check here and see if there is anything anybody else wants to input to you, right now.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. One detail that I thought you ought to know about the service module JETT is that we're going to recommend a push-pull maneuver, that is in the attitude I described. We'll want you to go half a foot per second plus-X on the LM, then jettison the service module, then go half a foot per second minus-X, which will be less time because you're suddenly a heck of a lot lighter. Over.
Okay. Understand. You want me to go a half a foot per second plus-X, JETT the service module, and go a half a foot per second minus-X.
That's affirm. We think that will give you plenty of separation, and also will be a slow enough rate so you'll have a chance to get some photos.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. One more thing we want to update you on with a little detail. As we told you, the ascent SEP attitude was in plane and the LM JETT attitude will be more similar to a normal service module SEP attitude, that is it will be LM up, out the radius vector and 45 degrees right, out of plane toward the south. We are going to recommend that prior to JETT, the configuration be with the LM overhead hatch closed, with the vent valve open, and we'll JETT with the tunnel pressurized. Over.
Okay, Joe. Understand that the LM JETT attitude will be similar to service module normal jettison, which will be up and out of plane, and as soon as I finish maneuvering to left JETT attitude, I'll scramble up and close the LM hatch, making sure the vent valve is open, and then we'll vent it - or jettison it with the tunnel pressurized.
That's affirmative. And Deke says don't forget to close the command module hatch on your way in.
I'm already scared that Jack will have it closed before I get up there.
(Laughter)
Okay, Jim. I think that's about all we have for you right now. Whenever you feel like you don't have any more questions at the moment, we'd like you to reconfigure for down voice backup and we'd like you to do that to move the VOICE FUNCTION switch to DOWNVOICE BACKUP as usual, but instead of pulling the circuit breaker, we'd like you to throw the POWER AMP switch to off.
Okay, Joe. I have one more question, here. If we get a little bit ahead of time on the command module full powerup after we jettison the service module, I'd like to go to LM JETT attitude early, and make sure we get that part squared away and sit there for a while before LM JETT of 1 hour. Now, will we be using LM power up to that time? There's two cables which we'll probably have to disconnect on the way up through the tunnel if we're still going to use LM power?
That's affirmative. Let me get word on when we expect to go off LM power.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We expect to go off LM power at the time we start powering up the CSM or about minus 2-1/2 hours. That is not a hard number, and we'll be updating you on it. As far as going to the LM JETT attitude, that's completely permissible as soon as you have a powered up command module and a satisfactory platform, you can go there immediately. We're giving you a maximum of 1 hour just for grins. Over.
Okay. Fine. And that will be a LM maneuver, I assume, because we lost the service module, so no strain there.
Affirm.
And, Jack, would like to know what entry angle the midcourse-7 will give us?
Oh, it'll put us right in the middle of the corridor, Jim.
Okay.
6.50 degrees. And, Jim, Houston. I guess, as a last item, we expect that it will take us about an hour to update your checklist and your time lines sometime later on today, and we'd just like you to consider that. I expect it'll be 3 or 4 hours before we have all that stuff ready.
Okay. We'll be standing by for that, and now POWER AMPLIFIER switch is going to go off, and then we'll be going to DOWN VOICE BACKUP.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Houston, Aquarius.
Roger, Jim. We're receiving you now. Go ahead.
Okay. I thought you were calling, but I guess we had a ground switching problem down there.
Yes. We lost the lock for a little while there, Jim. Well, good day. Could you give us battery A voltage ... reading, please, and battery charger current, as you have been doing.
Okay, Vance. Stand by.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
Okay. Volts are 39.5; amps, 1.25.
Roger. Copy 39.5 and 1.25. Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Aquarius here. Go ahead, Houston.
Say, Jim. Could you give us another reading on the battery A voltage and BAT charger current on the CSM, please.
BAT amps coming up.
Okay. And sometime when you have some time to copy, I have an entry stowage list to give you which specifies which equipment will be moved between vehicles before splashdown.
Okay. I'm - I'll be able to copy that in a minute.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Volts, 39.4; amps, 1.25.
39.4, and say again amps.
1.25.
Roger. Copy. Thank you.
Okay, Vance. We're ready to cover - to copy the stowage list.
Okay, Jim. Now, I'll give it to you in two parts. The first is LM to command module equipment transfer. The second part will be the reverse, command module to LM equipment transfer. And both parts represent Deltas from the launch stowage, and here comes the first list, LM to command module equipment transfer. First, DSEA, and I'll give you the stowage location, too. That goes in R-13.
Vance, what was that again?
DSEA; that's recorder in - will go in the command module; it's recommended you stow it in R-13. Over.
Okay, the DSEA - that's the recorder - will be stowed in R-13.
That's affirm. Next. LM flight data file. That will go in R-1, R-2, and R-3. Next. Three PPKs in A-8.
Okay.
Okay. 16-millimeter and 70-millimeter exposed film in R-13. Okay, next. O<sub>2</sub> hose screen caps on the O<sub>2</sub> hoses. Next: two 70-millimeter Hasselblad cameras, and stow these in B-6 in the empty LiOH volume.
Okay, next. Black-and-white TV camera, and recommend stow that on top of A-7 and A-11 in decontamination bag. Next: flag kit, stowage location A-8. Next: LM fecal bags, used, R-9, waste management system chute.
Okay, that's the first list, Jim.
Okay.
And, if you want to read that one back, why then I'll - I'll give you the second one.
This is the LM to command module transfer, and this is the Delta from the launch stowage. Number 1: DSEA ...; number 2: LM flight data file in R-1, R-2, R-3; three PPKs in A-8 ... -
... A-8; and used LM fecal bags in R-9.
Okay, that's affirm, Jim. We had a lot of noise, and we didn't get the middle part, but I think that's fairly - should be fairly clear to you, and don't bother with the readback of that that we missed, unless you have any doubts. And then I'll, if you're ready to copy, I'll give you the second list.
Okay.
Okay. This is CM to LM equipment transfer. Cabin fan filter and bag, and that, in the LM, should go in the ISA. Okay, next: decontamination bags, except for the ones used to wrap camera, should go in the ISA.
Okay. Two LCGs, if you don't have them on already, to the IS - ISA. I realize you wouldn't have them on, because you're cold enough already.
That's right.
Okay, and finally, four LiOH cans, the ones used in the LM, and those can go in the jettison bag in the LM. Okay, a couple of notes. After loading the ISA, recommend secure it to the righthand restraint system.
And secure the jettison bag to the PLSS on the floor. And that's all.
Okay, Vance. This is command module to LM: cabin fan filter and bag in the ISA; decontamination bags, except for the ones we use for the TV camera, in the ISA; two LCGs in the ISA; four LOiH [sic] cans in the JETT bag; and we'll secure the ISA on the right-hand side - on the right-hand restraint system, and we'll secure the JETT bags to the PLSS on the floor.
Roger. That's it.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, would you give us PCM to HI bit rate. We think maybe we might be able to lock up on your high bit rate now. Over.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. We're getting it intermittently. We think we might get it steady and improve circuit margins if you would, in addition, on panel 16, open the PRIMARY POWER AMPL circuit breaker, and I'll give you next step in a minute.
Okay. PRIMARY POWER AMPL is opened.
Okay. And on panel 12, POWER AMPL to PRIMARY.
POWER AMPL to PRIMARY.
Roger.
Aquarius, 13.
Go ahead, Houston.
Or rather, Houston. Jim, it looks like we got a lockon, which is going to improve our data flow here. Only thing is, we'll probably lose data and probably voice, too, during a portion of each roll. So you might expect that. The other thing is, if anyone has on any BIOMED, would you switch your switch to - your BIOMED switch to that position.
Understand the first, Vance, and no one has on any BIOMED - -
Okay.
- - Fred and Jack are maneuvering things around right now, and mine is long since departed the scene.
Okay. Copy.
Vance, you might be interested - the way we're - the way we got this thing arranged, we have one helmet attached to the COMM lines attached to the LM hoses, and the guy that's got the duty wears the helmet, so the other people are free to maneuver.
Right. That's understandable. One guy's on the leash, huh?
Yes. ...
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, when you get finished moving your stowage around and it's convenient, we'd like to terminate the battery charge for a little while to bring up the CM TM so we can take a look at the temperatures again, like we did yesterday. Advise that right now on your batteries, you have 111 amp-hours; and, eventually, we hope to have them up - peaked up to about 116. One other point, we - we can either read that procedure up again which involves cranking up the telemetry, or, if Jack still has it, we can use his notes and - but I have one or two changes to - to make on them. Over.
Okay, understand that you'll want us to terminate battery charge for a while, and crank up the CM TM to read out temperatures. And you have a few changes to Jack's checklist, and I'll turn the COMM over here to Jack shortly, as soon as he's finished, and we'll get along with it.
Okay, we'll be standing by for - there's no hurry on it.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
Just out of curiosity, Vance, what's our distance and velocity now?
Hey, stand by 1. You're speeding up, I think.
Jim, we have you 101 000 miles out, and your velocity is 5848. Starting to speed up.
Okay. Thank you.
Sure enough.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay, Vance. Jim said that you want to terminate battery charge on battery A.
That's affirm, Jack. Request to - Before you terminate it, get the usual readout on voltage and current; and we'd also like a time of termination, and understand you have the termination procedures. Is that affirm?
Okay. That's affirm. Stand by. Let me just make sure I've got everything here before I go off on a tangent.
Okay, Jack, and your battery-charge termination procedure remains unchanged, but when we go to power up the CM and look at your TM, we have a couple of additional steps.
Okay. Vance, I do have the procedure for stopping the battery charge. And do you want me to copy this procedure now, or do you want me to come back and give you the volt, amps, and time and - after I complete this termination?
Okay. Just - just give us the volts and amps just before you start the termination of the procedure, and understand you say you have the charge - the procedure for taking the charge off. Is that affirm?
That's affirm.
Okay. And just give us a hack on the time - -
And you want to - you want to review it at all?
Negative. Unless you want me to. I'll tell you what; I could run through it very quickly just to verify that we're getting started off on the correct path here.
Yes. Okay, the first four or five things that I have is panel BAT CHARGE to OFF on panel 3; AC INVERTER 2, OFF; panel 5: MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C ON; panel 250: CB BAT A POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, open; panel 275: INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, open; and then, the - just to go ahead and reverse the position of the switches and circuit breakers that I started out with, and these don't have to be in reverse order. Is that Charlie?
Roger, that's - that's Charlie. Have at it.
Okay, we'll get a volts and amps right now.
Okay.
Okay, Vance. The volts and amps: 39.4; amps, 1.25.
Okay, Jack. We copy that. Incidentally - -
Okay. We're going up to termin - Go ahead, Vance.
Never mind, Jack. I'll bring this up later when you've finished the procedure.
Okay. I'm going off the air; I'll put Fred-o on. I'm going to stop the battery charge.
Okay.
Now, how do you read, Vance?
Hey, loud and clear, Fred. Understand you've been doing some spring housecleaning, moving stowage around up there.
Boy, you wouldn't believe this LM right now; it's nothing but bags from floor to ceiling.
Hey, that brings up a question. We were wondering where you guys plan to stow the probe and drogue? It occurred to us that one possibility was to stow it in the LM, down about where the LMP normally stands, underneath the IS - ISAer. Perhaps you have a better idea. Over.
Yes, I do, Vance. ... would go in the LM, but I thought maybe we ought to stow it where the CDR stands. How's that?
Okay. I can tell that you're just getting - getting that one over because Jim just got off the loop.
Yes, he's sleeping. No, that's - that's actually where we normally had been stowing it for normal LM JETTs.
Okay, and - Hey, we just - we'll record that, and figure that you'll stow the probe and drogue over in the - where the CDR stands. We have a - a change to this - equipment transfer list that I just read up to Jim. Why don't you make a note of this one item? Forget about the LM - -
Stand by; stand by 1.
Okay.
I think Jack hauled off the piece of paper with that - all that on it. Why don't you hold it until Jack gets done doing the battery charge?
Okay.
And, Fred, request PCM on LO bit rate, now.
Okay. And there was one piece of flight data that we needed that we didn't bring along this time.
What was that?
That's a big book with a lot of just plain old blank pages in it.
Yes, when you - when you get off nominal, why you just need scratch paper, don't you?
Yes.
Okay, Vance. I got the stowage list now.
Okay, I gave you two lists - -
And Jack's got - and Jack said he's completed - the - secured the battery charge now.
Okay, and we're recording the time that that was complete. You have two lists there, one is LM to CM equipment transfer and the second list is the reverse. Request you scratch the last item on the first list, which is returning used bags to the CM.
Okay. We didn't have any of those, so that didn't pose any problem anyway.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Okay, Vance. Aquarius is back on.
Okay, Jack. Understand you completed securing the battery charge. Now if you are ready to copy, Jack, I would like to give you the two changes that we have to the powerup for the CM procedure. Over.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay.
Okay, Vance. You say you have some changes in the procedures that I used before to get telemetry and to check out the CSM system?
Yes, that's correct, Jack; they're pretty simple. About halfway through the procedure, we have a step on panel 3, which is POWER AMPL, HIGH; we'd like to change that to POWER AMPL, LOW.
Okay. Copy. POWER AMPL, LOW.
And the next change, Jack, is panel 275. Scratch the step "CB MAIN B, BAT B, close - BAT BUS B, close."
Okay. You want to delete the step "CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B, close."
Roger. As you know, we're going to do this on LM power, so this reflects that.
Okay. Real fine.
Okay, and have at it. We - we'd like to have the TM up for about 5 or 10 minutes to look at the data from the CM; look at your temperatures, et cetera. And after that, we'll go back to charging the battery again, and the charge will probably go until around GET 126.
Okay. Do you want the same readouts from me that I gave you before?
That's affirmative, Jack. And just to make sure that there is no mistaking the procedure, it starts out for the backout part: panel 3, POWER AMPL, OFF; TRANSPONDER, OFF; AC INVERTER 2, OFF; then goes to panel 250, et cetera.
That's - that's the way I read it.
Okay.
Okay; going back up into the refrigerator.
Hey, I thought it was the bedroom.
Well, it's got a new name now, because it is about 30 degrees cooler.
Roger. Returning to the deep freeze - -
- - Hey, Vance. One thing that I wanted to ask you - is on the stowage list where you have us putting the black-and-white TV camera on top of A-7 in an A ... decontamination bag, I was wondering if it would be possible or if you - there would be any problem in putting it into B-6 along with the two 70-millimeter Hasselblad cameras?
Jack, I don't think there'll be any problem, if you can get it in, but let us get - work that and get back with you. Okay?
All right. I was just thinking. I'm trying to get as much weight as possible down there in that LEB. We have no SRCs and then our waste tank is - you know - rather depleted. I think it's about down to 40 percent or so. So I'm trying to get as much L over D as I can, and any heavy items we can get down there, I'd be greatly appreciative of you bringing it to our attention.
Okay. We copy that, and we owe you an answer on your last question.
Okay. And I'm in work, going to give you some telemetry.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. We're receiving CSM data now.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston.
Say again, Vance.
Fred, we just lost data on Aquar - on Jack. Would you have him select best OMNI, please?
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
All right. Go ahead.
Fred, we have enough data; recommend that Jack take off the TM and power back down again, using his backout procedure. Just let us know when he does it.
Okay.
And, after that, we'll start the battery charge, and we'll have to know when he starts that.
Okay. He's starting to back out now. Just out of curiosity, what - did you all get a readout on what the cabin temp was up there?
Yes, we're getting 45 to 46 degrees.
Now you see why we call it the refrigerator.
Yes, it's kind of a cold winter day up there, isn't it? Is it snowing in the command module yet?
Is it what, Vance?
Is it snowing in there yet?
Oh, snowing. No - no, not quite. The windows are in pretty bad shape, and I guess the service module - we'll be trying to shoot out of the LM window, because every window in the command module is just covered with water droplets. It's going to take a lot of scrubbing to get those cleared off.
Roger. Understand. Pete says to tell you that you'll have some time on the beach in Samoa to thaw out after this cold experience.
Hey, that sounds great.
Vance, have you all thought about what cameras you wanted to use? Right now, we've got configured a Hasselblad with a 250, and I've got the lunar-surface number 1 Hasselblad, and I've got the lunar surface sequence camera, also, rigged and ready to go. Did you have any other druthers about the ...
You are referring to the photography of the service module, is that right?
That's right.
We have some procedures in work, and I've seen them, Fred. I think pretty soon we'll be shooting them up to you to specify which cameras and settings. But that - that sounds pretty close.
Okay, you might let them know that, if they hadn't thought of it, that we got this lunar-surface sequence camera on board which has its own battery pack setup, and to shoot quite a few pictures with, and that could also be used for this.
Roger. I know we are planning to use that camera, among others.
Okay.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. Jack has backed out of powering up the CM, and now he's proceeding to restart battery charge on BAT A.
Okay. Real good, Fred. We copy.
Okay. And we are charging battery A now.
Roger. Charging battery A, Fred.
And, Fred, request now first reading of voltage - BAT A voltage and charger current. Over.
Okay, Vance. I can give it to you. I read it right after I started it. BAT A voltage was 39.4 and the current had jumped up to 1.4.
Okay. 39.4 and 1.4. Thanks, Jack.
Okay. How about - You ready for some other readouts, that you wanted there?
Ready to copy.
Okay. BAT B, 37.0; pyro A, 37.0; pyro B, 37.0; SPS helium pressure, 3400; and nitrogen A and B - just for throwing it in for kicks, 2200 and 2400, respectively; and the injector temperature - stand by- The Sun went down. Okay. The injector temperature, 5 Charlie, 3.9; 5 Dog, 3.2; 6 Alfa, 3.6; 6 Baker, 3.9; 6 Charlie, 3.5; 6 Dog, 3.4; the battery manifold pressure, 1.4.
Okay. We copy all that, Jack. Thank you.
Okay.
You say, you figure you are going to be charging BAT A until about 126?
Roger. About 126:30 is an estimate, Jack.
Okay. You figure it will be fully charged then, huh?
Yes. That's right. We'll have all the batteries up to about 116 amps-hours.
That's good news.
That's better than 99, huh?
You're right.
How did all our systems look on ..., Vance?
I didn't hear any complaints, but just a minute; let me make a detailed check.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jack, it's a general statement. It looks like temperatures have cooled off in the ballpark of 6 to 8 degrees cooler than what they were yesterday. Looks like everything is still within tolerance, but we're working up a detailed sheet of temperatures to send up to you, for your interest.
Okay. That sounds good.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Vance, Joe brought up the alinement at EI minus 2 plus 30. Were you going to send up or have a discussion about that later on.
That's correct, Jack. We just about have procedures in hand detail checklist-type procedures to send to you. In other words, a time line with reference to entry checklist and any changes in the entry checklist. So, if you have a few pages of scratch paper, why, I think we'll have that to you within an hour.
Okay. I'll be standing by.
One other thing, Jack - You still with me?
Yes, go ahead.
The stowage people have tried out this black-and-white TV camera into B-6 idea and they say even with the lens off, they can't get it in. So, I still recommend that it be stowed where we had it on the list. That's A-7.
No problem.
All right, go ahead.
Jack, request another voltage/readout on BAT A and current on BAT charger.
Okay, Vance. The volt 39.3, amp 1.3.
Roger. Copy 39.3 and 1.3.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Vance.
Jack, looks like the LM suit release valve has been bumped to AUTO again; request it - -
Okay.
- - closed. Over.
In work.
Okay.
How's that right there?
Okay. They say it looks good.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. We need another one of those voltage amps readouts and then maybe we will get off of your back for a little while.
Oh, don't worry about it. I'd like to have you talk with us. Volts and amps coming up.
Okay.
Okay, Vance. Volts 39.4, amps 1.25.
Okay. EECOM's got it duly recorded.
Is John Aaron on?
No. Gee, I don't know what shift he is on. But he comes in later, I guess.
Actually, all the shifts are morning shifts to us.
Say that one again - -
The Sun is always shining - All of the shifts are morning shifts to us, because the Sun is always shining.
That was a short night.
Just for curiosity's sake, are we still holding entry angle at 6.25?
Okay. Jack, right now we're told that it's closer to 6, and - But they would like to track it some more. Looks like your next midcourse will be in the order of 2 to 3 foot per second.
Okay.
I just got a good view of the Southern Cross, Alpha and Beta Centauri, and Atria.
Houston, 13.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. We're still in good shape as far as water goes in the LM?
Okay. We copy.
The reason I ask is I'm assuming that we are, and I have no idea each time I pressurize the surge tank to get water out of the command module, how much I drop that surge tank and if we are in good shape as far as water goes in the LM, we'd like to fill a couple of drink bags to get some water for drinking purposes.
Okay. Have you run out of CM drinking water. yet, Jack?
Oh, no, we've got plenty of drinking water.  I think the - I don't have any idea what the surge tank pressure is.
Okay. It's 750 - -
- - and I don't have any - -
It's 750, Jack.
Okay. 750.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. Stand by 1, Jack, and we'll give you an indication of how that water situation on the LM is - which is your question. Right?
Okay. But I guess what I was really asking is, if you'd have any violent objections if we filled two drink bags from LM water rather than repressurizing the surge tank.
Okay. Stand by on that.
Also, Jim is asleep up there and we didn't want to bother him, either.
Okay. We understand.
And, Jack, we'll be changing stations in 1 minute; so, we may have a temporary dropout in COMM.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Okay, Vance. Go ahead. Loud and clear.
Okay, Jack. We're going to bargain with you on this one. Instead of two, would - wish that you would just get just one bag full. That shouldn't do any harm; however - -
Okay.
- - we are not all that fat on water that we want to do any drinking out of the LM as a regular thing after this one bag. So would you let us know when you get the water out and give us a mark on it so we can watch the TM. Over.
Okay. Fred-o is about to withdraw the water now.
Okay, Vance. We've withdrawn - oh, about 8 ounces of water.
Okay, Jack. How's it taste?
It's - good. It's not quite as gaseous as that in the command module.
Apollo 13, Houston - or rather, Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Hey, Jack, we need another reading. Volts and amps.
Okay. They're coming up.
Vance, you won't believe this, but Fred-o says it's 39.4 and 1.245.
Okay. Our EECOM is recording those numbers. Charlie Dumas, this time.
Oh.
Not changing very fast, is it?
How far out are we?
Okay. 953 and 6068 on velocity, per FIDO.
Okay.
Bill Stoval.
Thank you.
Houston, Aquarius. Over
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Are the flowers in bloom in Houston?
No, not yet. Still must be winter.
Suspicions confirmed.
Yes, I doubt if they will be blooming even Saturday, when you return.
I concur.
Hey, Jim, we have some photo information to pass up to you. Discussed this briefly with Fred earlier. It's instructions or suggestions for which photos - which cameras and lenses to use during your service module photography. Over.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Okay. We have three cameras here, two of them to be used for picture taking from the LM, one to be used from the number 5 window of the CSM. First, I'll hit the LM cameras. And this camera that I mention now has first priority. It's considered the one to give you the best results. That's the 70-millimeter DC Reseau camera, Hasselblad, that is, with the 80-millimeter lens, from box A-13. Suggest fresh magazine of 3400 black-and-white film.
Okay.
Okay. Suggest either magazine R or magazine S from A-13. Transfer all of this to the LM and recommend the following settings: LM/DC/80/BW 3400 (f:5.6 at a 250th).
And that's all for that one.
Okay, Vance. Let me see if I have it here. For the LM, want to use the 70-millimeter DC Hasselblad 80-millimeter lens in A-13, using 3400 black-and-white film MAGs R or S. Prepare to take camera to the LM, and the setting would be the LM/DC/80/BW 3400 (f:5.6) at a 250th.
That's correct. Okay. Next: the next camera - Stand by 1. I've got noise here. Okay. The next LM - The next camera for the LM will be the 16-millimeter, and these photos are considered to be priority 3. Okay. One, get the 16-millimeter DAC and powerpack from A-8. Get the 10-millimeter lens, and remove it - remove the 10-millimeter lens, and take the 18-millimeter lens from B-3 and attach it to the camera. And attach the power cable transfer to the LM, set frame rate at 12 frames per second, and the same data line that I gave you before reads this way this time. LM/DAC/18/CEX, battery (f:8 and 1/250th). Okay. Now looking at these two cameras in the LM, it's recommended that you use the 16-millimeter for the first 2-1/2 minutes and then switch to the 70-millimeter. That's partly because the frame's been - or the - They've been optimized for closer and longer range. Okay. Read back, please.
Okay, Vance. Essentially, what you wanted to use as far as the movie camera in the LM goes, is our lunar sequence camera which is attached to the powerpack. We use the 18-millimeter lens, set it at 12 frames per second ... f:8 at 250th of a second.
Roger. f:8 at 250th.
Right; f:8 at 250th.
Okay. Would you believe that we have a correction now to the last camera I gave you? Correct that 18-millimeter lens to 75-millimeter lens.
Okay. The 18-millimeter to the 75-millimeter lens. Okay.
Right. Okay. Next for the command module pictures, it may be a little hard to see the service module from the command module, but if you can see it, it will be through window 5, people down here think. Recommend for that the CM 70-millimeter. These photos have priority 2. So this is 70-millimeter EL, with - which has the 80-millimeter attached, and this is all in B-3. Take off the 80-millimeter lens and attach the 250-millimeter lens. And the 250-millimeter lens can be found in U-4. Use CEX film from A-13. Ring sight from A-7, and these pictures will be f:8 at a 250th. And I think probably by now you probably all have - already have these cameras configured, and this may be redundant information, but here it is anyway. Over.
Okay, Vance. You're right. We do have cameras almost configured like you said. For the command module, you think that the EL with the 250 lens, CEX film, f:8 at a 250th is the best bet, and you're saying now that where you think you'll see it is out window 5? Is that it?
That's right, Jim.
Okay. My procedure, now, after service module JETT is going to be to pitch up, in order to try to get the service module into the - to get the center window in view of the service module, which we are going to have somebody there - to photograph. Why do you think window 5 will be it?
Okay. Stand by on that one. This is a question of geometry, and I'll get right back.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, regarding window 5, I have a drawing here; and, when you're docked, you have approximately a 60-degree angle between the Z-axes of the two spacecraft. It appears that peering out window 5, you would be looking at the rendezvous radar on top of the LM which would, if you pitched, more or less give you a view of the service module. That is, if you pitched, so - from - and I think that this has been run by quite a few folks here; so, offhand, I can't see where any other window would be as good or perhaps even possible.
Okay. I understand. Yes, you're right. When we look out window 5, we can see rendezvous radar, and we'll try - We'll try window 5.
Roger. It presumes, though, that there has to be a pitch to be able to see it. You guys sound a lot more rested today.
Well, I just went back and sacked out for an hour or so and didn't get back up.
Very good.
And, Jim, Houston. We really are going to get those checklists up to you.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, it's time for readings on the battery charging again. Request the BAT A voltage and the charger amps. Over.
Okay. Stand by, Vance.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
Okay. We have no more water in the potable tank. We tried to get some more out a few minutes ago, and there isn't any.
Okay. Understand you ran out of water in the CM potable tank.
Affirmative.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, we - you were able to get those voltage - BAT A voltage and current readings?
Oh, yes. Fred's - Fred's up there now.
Okay. And we're ready to read you the first checklist installment. This will - What we're going to readup is going to be a LM time line, a CSM time line, and checklist changes to conform with these. And right now I have the first installment of the CSM time line ready to read up. Over.
Okay, Jack. I'm going to get - Vance, I'm going to get Jack on the line for that; and so stand by.
Okay. And he'll need a lot of paper.
Okay. Volts are 39.5; amps, 1.24. Stand by.
Okay. We got it.
Aquarius, Houston.
Okay, Vance. I'm on and ready to copy.
Okay, Jack. Wait 1. We want to get one into the hands of FLIGHT and EECOM, and it'll take about a minute or 2. Sorry to wake you up for this, but take about a minute, and then we'll read it up to you.
Aquarius, Houston.
Okay, Vance. Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. Do you have any of that CM water - bagged water, left? Over.
Negative. I went up and tried to repressurize the surge tank and get another shot of water, and was able to repressurize the surge tank okay, but there was no water that came out of the water tank.
Yes. We understand that there isn't any more in the potable tank, but we understood that you had put some water from that tank into bags, and I wondered if any of the bags were left.
Negative.
Okay.
Okay, Jack. Ready to copy?
Okay, Vance. Ready to copy.
Okay. Start at EI minus 6-1/2 hours. You're going to re - get LM pads and CSM pads, and I don't know if you want to copy them or not. This is something I can just read off to you. Over. Without you copying unless you especially want it.
Okay.
Okay. LM pad, SM jettison - -
Okay. Go ahead; read which ones we're going to get.
Okay. I'll read them fast first here so you get a general idea. LM pad, service module JETT attitude, Moon viewing attitude, Sun viewing attitude, and LM JETT attitude. The CM pads are coarse aline angles for LM attitudes during Moon and Sun sightings, coarse aline angles for entry REFSMMAT, and CMC angles on entry REFSMMAT for LM JETT. Moon viewing, and entry. Okay. That - That's general pad information. If you want, I'll read it slowly so you can copy it all down; otherwise, I'll go ahead.
I got - I was trying to copy it as you were reading it, Vance. The LM pads are service module jettison attitude, Moon viewing attitude, Sun viewing attitude, and LM jettison attitude. Is that correct?
That's correct. Okay. I'll read the CM pads now, slowly. Coarse aline angles for LM attitudes during Moon and Sun sightings.
Okay. The next coarse aline angles for entry REFSMMAT. Okay. The next, CMC angles on entry REFSMMAT for (1) LM JETT, (2) Moon viewing, (3) entry. Okay. I'll stand by until you read that back.
Okay. The CSM pads will be coarse aline angles for LM attitudes during Moon and Sun sightings. Coarse aline angles for entry REFSMMAT. CMC - CMC angles on entry REFSMMAT for (1) LM jettison, (2) Moon viewing, (3) entry.
Okay. That's correct.
Okay, Jack. Going to hold up 1. All the hordes of people that devised this procedure are going to be coming into the room in a minute, and they'd like to hold up until everybody can listen in.
Get that, Jack?
Okay, Vance. We're ready to go.
Okay. We lost you there briefly while you were in an attitude where we couldn't receive you. Jack, we'd like to hold off for about 5 minutes. We have some more people coming in to listen to this, and it took a lot of people to devise this procedure, and a few people have been testing it out, so we'd like to have them all on hand while we give you the rest.
Okay.
How's the temperature up there, Jack? You guys chopping wood to keep warm?
Deke, it's about 51, I think, or 50 in the LM, and it's about - I don't know - 45 or little bit less in the command module.
Oh, it's a nice fall day, huh?
Yes, I tell you, we don't have to worry about chilldown.
Okay, Vance. While we're waiting, do you have there also what I can expect ground to uplink me?
We'll have that, Jack, but - Stand by for that.
Okay.
Jack, probably - probably the thing to do is to give you all of the checklist, and it will include things like this. Then we'll have a big question and answer session afterwards, if that's okay by you.
Okay. That sounds good.
Okay, Vance. While we're waiting, just for your information, the command module has been stowed per your checklist with the exception of the two Hasselblad cameras.
Roger. Got that, Jack.
And the LM is pretty well stowed with the exception when we have yet to bring in the probe and the drogue.
Roger. Got that.
Relative to your water situation, Jack, we're going to have a pretty good hack on the LM here in the next few hours, and we anticipate letting you fill your own tanks before we transfer over, so you should be in reasonably good shape there.
Okay. We have a number of juice bags all out and ready to go, and we tried to get the water out of the command module about 20 minutes ago and found out that the command module's potable tank was empty. So we have no bags made up now, so we're dependent on LM water, PLSS water.
Roger. If you feel like trying the PLSS, that's all excess, and you might want to try that at any time. I'm sure it'll taste like PLSS but you might as well try it.
Okay.
Okay, Deke. All the windows in the command module are heavily coated with water right now. So I don't know what kind of pictures we'll get out of them, but I'm going to try and clean them off and do the best I can with the 250-millimeter lens on the Hasselblad.
Roger. That's why we have the top priority stuff in the LM. We figure you've got a much better chance of getting it through there.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Are you ready to send it up, Vance?
Jack, before we start reading the procedure, we'd like - We find that BAT A is topped off and in great shape. Like to switch over and top off BAT B some more. Give it 2 more hours of charging. Have about a seven- or eight-step procedure here to give you, if you want to copy that. We're switching before we start recording the entry procedures.
Okay. Stand by and let me get out my other checklist.
Okay, Vance. Ready to copy.
Okay. Panel 3: switch BATTERY CHARGE to OFF. Panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE BAT A/C to BAT A/C; CB BATTERY CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE to open; CB BATTERY CHARGER, BAT B CHARGE, close. Next, panel 250; CB BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING to close. Panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT B/C, off. Panel 3; BATTERY CHARGE to B. Advise; well, stand by. Jack, advise that we have a backout procedure for this, but we'll read that up to you later, in about 2 hours. And, also, that this procedure is a DELTA to your - the first battery charging procedure that we gave you. In other words, it's a DELTA from where you are right now.
Okay. This is the procedure for charging BAT Baker. Panel 3; BAT CHARGE, OFF; panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C to A/C; CB BAT CHARGER, BAT A CHARGE, open; CB BAT CHARGER, BAT B CHARGE, close. Panel 250; CB BAT B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, close. Panel 5; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT B/C, to OFF; Panel 3; BAT CHARGE to B. This is a DELTA for the first battery charging procedure; you'll give me the backout procedure in a couple hours.
That's affirm.
Okay. I'll put it in work right now, then come back and stand by to copy the rest of - well, I - not the rest - everything.
Everything is right.
You'd never believe how much this procedure's been massaged in the last day.
Okay, Vance. I put BAT Baker on charge; I don't think it quite had stabilized. It was reading 1.1 amps, 39.6 volts when I left up there.
Okay. We got that.
Okay. I guess now is as good a time to start as any.
Just a second, Jack.
Aquarius, Houston.
Okay, Vance. You're kind of weak, but readable.
Jack, we're going to need readings on the BAT volt and charger amps about every 10 or 15 minutes for a while, so is there somebody else that can be reading them out while you're copying? Over.
Yes. Jim will take a run up there. Fred-o is sleeping right now. We're trying to get some sleep here, and Jim'll run up and take a look at voltage and current whenever you call.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Vance, we've got to realize that we've got to establish a work-rest cycle up here, so we just can't wait around here to just read procedures all the time up to the burn. We've got to get them up here, look at them, and then we've got to get the people to sleep. So take that into consideration when you get ready to send up the pads.
I know, Jim. We're very conscious of that. We - we should be ready to go in about 5 minutes. That's all I can say. Stand by.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Okay, Vance. We're ready to go.
Okay. We need a - Sorry (laughter). We need a readout. Volts and amps.
Okay. In work.
And, might as well bring the COMM up to a higher fidelity for this long period of checklist reading. That requires, panel 16: CB PRIMARY S-BAND POWER AMP, closed.
Okay, PRIMARY S-BAND POWER AMP closed now. How do you read?
Okay. And next step, panel 12: S-BAND FUNCTION to VOICE and RANGING FUNCTION to RANGING.
Okay, Vance. The S-BAND FUNCTION is at VOICE and the RANGING switch was at RANGING.
Okay. That makes it so we can hear you better, Jack.
Okay. Can we - Since the first part of it, you're just going to read and I'm going to copy and we're going to have a question and answer period later, can we get started?
Okay. Procedure's coming back in again. Multicopies for distribution. And Ken's back. He's a local expert on this now, so we'll turn you over to him and he'll read it off.
Okay. Stand by. I'll give you volts and amps. Okay. The voltage is 39.1; amps, 1.75.
Okay.
Hello, Aquarius; Houston. How do you read?
Okay. Very good, Ken.
Okay. Let me take it from the top here. Just - there might be some overlap, but to make sure we're all on the same signal. We're starting off with a set of time line procedures that are going to give us - end up with the normal entry checklist. There will be some checklist changes into the book, but the bulk of what I have for you is the time line stuff. And it starts at 6 hours and 30 minutes prior to EI and assumes that we're getting LM power to MAIN B in the command module. I think you already have the numbers for the LM pads and the command module pads; I mean the types of pads we'll be giving you. And if you have a question on what they'll be doing or what they're for, I can go over those now or when we get through.
Okay. Yes, I'll make a little note there, and we'll discuss it when we get everything copied, huh?
All right. And the first item, then, after you get ready to start this checklist, is to install lithium hydroxide canisters and to stow ORDEAL. On panel 8, we want to turn the FLOODLIGHTS to FIXED.
Okay. Wait a minute. You're going too fast, here.
Okay. I'll tell you. I'll go line at a time and wait for your verification before I go on to the next one. I have panel 8, FLOODLIGHTS, FIXED,
Okay. Install LiOH canisters, stow ORDEAL, FLOODLIGHTS, FIXED.
Okay. That's the panel 8 floodlights. Now we're going to take panel 5 and put the FLOODLIGHT rheostat to FLOOD and the LEB, that's panel 100, FLOODLIGHTS are also going to FIXED. And the purpose of this is to balance up buses A and B.
Okay. Panel 5; FLOODLIGHTS; you want the rheostat on. Panel 100, FLOODLIGHTS; you want FIXED.
That's affirmative. Okay. On panel 8: circuit breakers EMS, MAIN A and MAIN B, that's two, open.
Okay. Panel 8: EMS MAIN A and MAIN B, open.
Okay. On panel 250: circuit breaker BATTERY A POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.
Okay. Panel 250: CB BAT A POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.
Okay. The same for circuit breaker BATTERY B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING.
Okay. BATTERY B POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.
Okay. And add BATTERY C POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING.
BATTERY C POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, closed.
Okay. That's correct. On panel 5: circuit breaker BAT CHARGE, BATTERY A CHARGE, closed.
Okay. Panel 5: CB BAT CHARGE, BAT A, close.
Okay. And the same for circuit breaker for BATTERY CHARGE, BAT B/CHARGE, closed.
Okay, BAT CHARGER, BAT B, closed.
All right. Like to take MAIN BUS TIES, two of them, on and up. That's probably a verify.
MAIN BUS TIES A/C and B/C, on, verify.
That's correct. Circuit breaker BATTERY RELAY BUS, BATTERY A and B, closed.
Okay. CB BAT RELAY BUS, BAT A, and BAT RELAY BUS, BAT B, closed.
That's affirmative. Circuit breaker EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
Okay. On panel 275: circuit breaker MAIN A, BATTERY C, closed.
Okay, Ken. Wait on that one here. I'm just about to lose you here. Just - I've got to change OMNIs.
Okay.
Okay. Could you give me that one again, please.
All right. On panel 275: circuit breaker MAIN A, BATTERY C, closed.
Okay. MAIN A, BAT B, closed on 275.
That's MAIN A, BATTERY C, Charlie.
MAIN A, BAT C, Charlie.
That's affirm. No - Negative on battery Bravo.
Okay. Negative on battery Bravo. That's MAIN A, BAT Charlie, closed.
Okay. Good. On panel 276: circuit breaker INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL, 3 and 4, open.
Would you say that one again, Ken?
All right. On panel 276: circuit breaker INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL, 3 and 4, open.
Okay. Panel 276: CB INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL, 3 and 4, open.
That's affirmative. Okay. Panel 5: circuit breaker CENTRAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER, MAIN B, closed.
Okay. On panel 5: ...
Okay. I'm sorry, Jack. Would you read that again, please?
Okay. On panel 5: CB CENTRAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER, MAIN B, closed.
Okay. That's correct. PRIMARY EVAPORATE WATER CONTROL valve to AUTO.
This is on 382?
That's affirmative.
Wha - Wha -
Okay, Jack. We want to put the PRIMARY and the SECONDARY EVAPORATED WATER CONTROL valves to AUTO.
Okay.
And, Jack, can you give us a readout on BAT B and the charger current?
Okay, Ken. That was the PRIMARY and SECONDARY H<sub>2</sub>O CONTROL valves to AUTO on 382.
That's affirmative, and did you copy about the readout on the battery and charger?
Yes. Jim's on his way up.
Okay. Thank you. All right, the next little step after your water control valves is to perform the CSM RCS preheat. We'll do that on page E/1-5, steps 35 and 37.
Okay, Ken. We're having a problem with the COMM. You read now?
Yes, sir. Loud and clear.
Okay. It's perform CM - CSM RCS preheat, and could you say again all after?
Okay. I'm referring to the entry checklist, page E/1-5, steps 35 and 37.
Okay.  Perform CSM RCS preheat per entry checklist, page 1-5, steps 35 and 37.
That's affirmative. Now back to panel 5: circuit breaker CAUTION AND WARNING, MAIN B, closed.
CB CAUTION AND WARNING, MAIN B, closed.
That's affirm. On panel 2: CAUTION AND WARNING POWER to 1.
Panel 2: CAUTION AND WARNING POWER to 1.
That was POWER to number 1, Jack.
CAUTION AND WARNING POWER to 1.
Okay. On panel 5: circuit breaker EPS SENSOR UNIT, DC BUS A and B, closed.
Okay, Ken. The COMM from you is awful weak - awful weak, I - I can't - it's CB EPS SENSOR UNIT. Say again, after that.
All right, Jack. That's CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, DC, that's Delta Charlie, BUS A and B, closed.
Okay. CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, DC BUS A and B, close. And I'll give you the volts and amps.
Okay, that's correct. Go ahead.
Okay. Volts are 39.1; amps, 1.5.
Okay. On panel 3: MAIN BUS A and B, go to RESET and leave it in the center.
Okay, panel 3 - Stand by; got to change OMNI's.
Okay. MAIN BUS A and B, RESET, then center.
That's affirmative. Okay, now we're at EI minus 5 plus 05. And, as far as you're concerned, Jack, the command module is using this for information only. This will be the LM doing an Earth-terminator AGS alinement; and at the time of 5 plus 05 is the time they'll be going ahead and releasing their ball. And this will be covered in the LM checklist; it'll be uplinked after this one. At EI minus 5, we perform midcourse number 7. Over.
Okay. At EI minus 05:05, the LM is making an Earth-terminator aline; and at EI minus 05:00, we perform MCC-7.
That's correct. At the completion of midcourse 7, the LM will maneuver to a separation attitude. And this attitude will be sent up on one of the pads that you're going to get before all the sequence starts. And it'll be flown to the LM ball angles on that pad.
Okay. Understand.
All right. At EI minus 4 plus 40, we want to perform page 1-6, step 39 of the entry checklist.
Ken, I - I didn't get it. We had to change OMNI's again. Could you say it - the EI minus 4 dash - or 04:40, we do something.
Okay. And at that time, you'll want to perform step 39 of page E/1-6. Over.
Okay. Perform step 39 of entry checklist page E/1-6.
That's correct. Okay. The next is the command module RCS activation, and that's step 4-1 of page E/1-6.
Okay. The next is perform CSM - or CM RCS activation for step 4-1 of page E - E/1-6.
That's correct.
All right, Jack. The next is at EI minus 4 plus 30. We want to verify that the LM is configured for command module RCS hotfire.
Okay. Verify LM configure for RCS hotfire at EI minus 04:30.
That's correct. Now to panel 5: circuit breaker G&N IMU HEATER, MAIN B, closed.
Okay. Panel 5: CB G&N IMU HEATER, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
That's negative, Jack. That's MAIN B only.
Okay. MAIN B only.
I'm sorry; I lost you that time. Say it again.
Okay. Let's repeat it. Stand by. Cut out. We've really got a strange attitude, so this is why we are having the COMM problem. Panel 5: CB G&N IMU HEATER, MAIN B, closed.
That's affirmative. On panel 1: ROTATION CONTROL POWER, NORMAL. That's two of them, to AC/DC.
Okay, panel 1: RHC, NORMAL, two to AC/DC, two controllers.
That's correct. On panel 7: SCS, LOGIC POWER 2/3, ON.
SCS, LOGIC POWER 2/3, ON, panel 7.
That's affirm. Back to panel 2: RCS COMMAND, ON.
Panel 2: RCS COMMAND, ON.
That's correct. Now the command module RCS check per step 4 of page E/2-1.
Okay. Perform the command module RCS check per step 4, page 2-1.
That's correct. Okay, at this point, we want to lock the rotation hand controllers.
Okay. After that, lock both rotation hand controllers.
That's affirm. On panel 8: SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, two to ARM.
Okay. Panel 8: set PYRO ARM, two, to ARM. Do I get a MSFN GO for that?
That's negative, Jack. We haven't powered up any of the downlink at this time. You'll be doing this and the command module RCS pressurization both by yourself.
Okay.
Okay. Now, the next event is going to be the separation of the service module, and these are some LM steps, but so that you will know what is going on, I'll read them to you. The LM will do a LM plus-X of one-half foot per second. Then you'll be hitting the CM SM SEP on and up, on their command. As soon as we are free of the service module, the LM will do another LM minus-X for 0.5 feet per second. This is called the push-pull maneuver. I think it was described this afternoon.
Yes, Ken. It was, I heard about it.
Okay. I just wanted you to know that's the sequence you're in. Okay. At the completion of that, we go back to panel 8, and it's SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, both of them, to SAFE.
Okay. Panel 8: SEQ PYRO ARM, two, to SAFE.
Okay. And following this, we take SEQUENTIAL, LOGIC, two, to OFF.
Okay. LOGIC, two, to OFF.
I'm sorry, Jack. I'll have to ask you to repeat that.
Okay. Panel 8: SEQ LOGIC, two, to OFF. Are they ON now, Ken? I don't remember turning them - I guess that's part of one of the other sequences, huh? That we turned them ON?
That's affirm. The reason we're turning the logic off, Jack, is a power savings. So we'll be turning them off, and I'll be getting them back on when we go to get off of the LM; and then turn them back off, then we'll be turning them on prior to entry. Just so you know what's coming.
Okay, real fine.
Okay. Then following this, the LM will pitch up to acquire the Moon - Excuse me, they're going to pitch up and acquire the service module and photograph, and they'll be using the ACA for rotations from now on. And you may see the LM out of window number 5 at the same time they pitch up to acquire it.
Okay. The LM pitches up, acquires the service module and photographs it, and I should expect to find - might possibly see the service module out of window 5.
That's affirmative. Okay, now we're down to EI minus 3 hours, or the next time-event, and the LM starts a maneuver to what we call the Moon-view attitude. This maneuver is designed to place the command module optics pointing with zero zero at the Moon, and it will be flown to on the LM ball angle.
Okay, the LM maneuvers to the Moon-viewing attitude which would place the Moon in the center of the command module optics with them at zero zero.
That's affirmative. Okay, now we're going to panel 5, and it's circuit breaker G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN B, closed.
Okay. Panel 5: CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN B, closed.
That's affirmative. Now you're going to come up with a 37 ENTER 06 ENTER most likely on the computer. And what we want to do is to put the computer to standby; if you come up with a 37 06, you'll have to do an ENTER in order to get the code 62. If it's got 62 on it, you can do a PROCEED until the DSKY blanks. You might remember that the AC is still off at this time so you won't be getting the STANDBY status light, and your cue that the computer is indeed in standby is when the DSKY goes blank.
Okay. You're saying that I will probably get a PROGRAM 06 with a VERB 37 ENTER flashing.
I expect that you - -
ENTER 06.
I expect you are - -
Say again, Ken.
Yes. We think that you're going to come up with a 37 06 already in the DSKY. If you do, do an ENTER and that should take you to the code 00062, which is the request for standby. And when you get that, hit PROCEED until the DSKY blanks. If you come up with something else, that's where we want to end up anyhow. With either, when you get the code 62 when it comes up, just do a PROCEED on it.
Okay. Is there anything else I could get?
I don't believe so, Jack. That's one that when you get to that step, if you do get something else, we will be standing by to see that you see. The whole scheme is to go to standby.
Will you be getting it on downlink?
No, sir. We don't have that powered up yet.
Okay. I'll yell to Jim, and Jim will give you a call.
Okay. The basic thing, Jack, is just to get the computer in standby to save power.
Okay.
And we need another battery B readout.
Okay. He is on his way. Go ahead.
Okay. Now, we're at EI minus 2 plus 30; we're going to panel 5: circuit breaker ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION, MAIN A, closed.
Okay, CB ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION, MAIN A, closed.
That's correct. Now circuit breaker G&N, IMU HEATER, MAIN A, closed.
CB G&N, IMU HEATER, MAIN A, closed.
That's correct. CB LM POWER-1 and -2, open.
CB LM POWER-1 and -2, open.
That's correct. CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN A, closed.
CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN A, closed.
Okay, Jack. And that's correct. I got it out of sequence. Would you put that COMPUTER, MAIN A, ahead of LM POWER?
Okay, Ken. That's CB G&N, COMPUTER, MAIN A, closed, goes before CB LM POWER-1 and -2, open.
That's correct. Jack, what we're doing is we've had the LM powering MAIN B, and we've had all these particular loads on it, and we're getting ready to secure LM power so we wanted to make sure that essential things like the computer, the platform, and all have dioded power supplies before we remove the LM power.
Okay. Sounds good. Volts, 39.1; amps, 1.3.
Okay. Thank you. All right, now panel 275: circuit breaker MAIN B, BATTERY BUS B, closed.
Panel 275: CB MAIN B, BAT BUS B, closed.
That's correct. Circuit breaker INVERTER POWER 1, 2, and 3, closed.
CB INVERTER POWER 1, 2, and 3, closed.
That's correct. On panel 5: circuit breaker BATTERY RELAY BUS, BATTERY A and B, closed.
CB BAT RELAY BUS, BAT A and B, closed.
That's correct. Circuit breaker INVERTER CONTROL 1, 2, and 3, closed.
CB INVERTER CONTROL 1, 2, and 3, closed.
That's correct. On panel 3: AC INVERTER 1, MAIN A.
Okay. Panel 3: AC INVERTER 1 to MAIN A.
That's correct. Now, AC INVERTER 1, AC BUS 1, ON.
Okay. AC INVERTER 1 to AC BUS 1 to ON.
That's correct. And we're going to also put AC INVERTER 1, AC BUS 2, ON.
Okay. AC INVERTER 1 to AC BUS 2, ON.
That's correct. Back to panel 5. Circuit breaker EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC 1 and 2, closed.
Stand by, Ken. I'm going to switch OMNIs here. You got cut out.
Roger.
Okay. Could you repeat that, please?
Okay. On panel 5: circuit breakers EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC 1 and 2, closed.
Okay. CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, AC 1 and AC 2, closed.
That's correct. Circuit breaker EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC 1 and 2, closed.
Okay. CBS - CB EPS SENSOR UNIT, AC 1 and AC 2, closed.
That's correct. And circuit breaker CAUTION/WARNING, MAIN A, closed.
CB CAUTION/WARNING, MAIN A, closed.
That's correct. On panel 3: AC INVERTER, AC BUS 1 and 2, RESET and back to the center.
AC INVERTER, BUS 1 and 2, RESET then center.
That's correct. On panel 225: circuit breaker FLIGHT BUS, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
Okay, panel - Okay, CB, FLIGHT BUS, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
That's correct. CB CTE, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
CB CTE, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
That's correct. On panel 4: TELCOM, GROUP 1, AC1.
TELCOM, GROUP 1, to AC1.
And TELCOM, GROUP 2, to AC2.
TELCOM, GROUP 2, to AC2.
That's correct. On panel 3: S-BAND NORMAL, TRANSPONDER, to PRIMARY.
S-BAND NORMAL, TRANSPONDER, to PRIMARY.
That's correct. We want to take POWER, SCE, to NORMAL.
POWER, SCE, to NORMAL.
All right, and POWER, PMP, to NORMAL.
POWER, PMP, to NORMAL.
That's correct, and UP TELEMETRY, COMMAND RESET to RESET and then NORMAL.
UP TELEMETRY, COMMAND RESET to RESET, then NORMAL.
Okay. On panel 2: UP TELEMETRY, CMC, to ACCEPT.
UP TELEMETRY, CMC to ACCEPT.
On panel 275: circuit breaker FLIGHT/POSTLANDING, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
A panel 275: CB FLIGHT/POSTLANDING, MAIN A and MAIN B, close.
That's correct. And configure for COMM on panels 6, 9, and 10.
Okay.
Okay, are you with me?
All right. I assume you got that. Panel 5: circuit breaker IMU, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
CB IMU, MAIN A and MAIN B, close.
That's correct. Circuit breaker OPTICS, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
Okay. CB OPTICS, MAIN A and MAIN B, close.
That's correct. CB G&N, POWER, AC1 and AC2, closed.
CB G&N, POWER, AC1 and AC2, close.
That's correct, and the G&N POWER switch to AC2.
Okay, G&N POWER switch to AC2.
That's correct. Now we want to perform the CMC powerup per the CSM G&C checklist, G 2-2.
Perform CMC powerup per the G&C checklist, page 2-2.
That's correct. Perform the EMS check, step 32 of the entry book, page 1-4.
Okay. Perform the EMS check per step 32 per the entry checklist, page 1-4.
That's correct. Okay, now the ground is going to give you a P27 update, at EI minus 2 plus 15. That's a - that's a time that you need to be configured to accept up telemetry. And what they're going to give you on a P27 update will by a clock increment, a state vector; they'll give you a VERB 66; they'll give you two REFSMMATs, there'll be an actual and a preferred; and the entry target load. Now, if you'd like. to copy those, I can take it a little slower.
No, I've got them. They are going to give me a clock DELTA, state vector, VERB 66, two REFSMMATs, and an entry target load.
That's correct. Okay, and then we'll do - -
There isn't much else they could give me, is there, Ken?
No, not very much. How about IMU powerup according to the G&C checklist, G/2-1.
Okay. Perform IMU powerup per G&C checklist, page 2-1.
That's correct. And while you are there, you can do the optics powerup on G/2-3.
Perform the optics powerup per page 2-3.
That's correct; and on panel 229: circuit breaker TIMERS, MAIN A, closed.
Okay. Panel 229: CB TIMER, MAIN A, closed.
That's correct. And the next thing you will do will be to set the mission timer and what we've done is to only turn on the mission timer on the MDC. And you'll probably have to wait here until they get through with the uplink so you can have the computer.
Okay. Set it from the CMC, huh?
That's affirm. Okay. Now, we are getting ready to start the alinement sequence, and are you familiar with the general sequence of events we're going to use, Jack?
How do you mean? We are going to make an alinement on the Moon and on the Sun; other than that - I didn't get any - I wasn't on the headset when the general information was passed up, so if there was any more than that, I didn't get it.
Okay. Basically, that is correct. Let me just run through it hand-waving-type for a minute, and then I'll read you the steps. I think it will make more sense. The scheme is that the LM can fly to a set of ball angles that will point your optics at the Moon. Now, at any time, in any attitude that we happen to be at, if you can look in the telescope and recognize star patterns sufficient that you believe you can make an alinement all on your own, that's the place we'd like to break off and let you go ahead and take over with your own alinement. However, we are giving you a procedure which will give you things we know you can see in the telescope without worrying about any reflections or anything of that nature, and it's not intended that this procedure has to be followed past the point where you know you've got good definition of star patterns in your telescope. If you need to go on, we'll maneuver, take a look at the Moon, we'll take a mark there, and then we'll maneuver with the LM/FDAI angles again and take a look at the Sun, and get yourself another mark on the Sun and that will complete the alinement. Now, the alinement scheme is that we are going to give you a set of angles that you can coarse aline the ball through when the LM is pointing you at the Moon. Now, this set of angles will agree with the REFSMMAT that you have in as a nominal REFSMMAT in you CMC. You can coarse aline to that, set a drift flag and REFSMMAT flag, and you'll have a good platform and we'll be within a couple of degrees of a good alinement. And, if we have to, we could break off at this point and go ahead with an entry; however, in an attempt to get a good platform, we are going to have you then do a P52 option 1, and what you are going to find in the option 1 slots is the entry REFSMMAT. You'll come up with the NOUN 22 values, and we intend to go ahead and coarse aline the ball to the entry REFSMMAT attitude, and then we'll go ahead and take marks through a normal P52 sequence. So that's the general scheme that we are going to use. If you think you have a handle on that, I will go ahead and read you the steps.
Okay. Well, let me ask a question. The LM maneuvers to a set of Moon-viewing angles. Okay, at this time, I am going to do a P52, is that right? With the planet option?
The first thing we are going to do is to coarse aline the platform and get it inertial, based on the REFSMMAT that you have in the present slot inside the CMC. We'll then go - and do a P52, option 4 - Correction, option 1.
Okay - That's after the LM gets established at the attitude. Jim says I'm here at the Moon-viewing attitude, I do a VERB 41 NOUN 20 to the set of angles that you're going to give me in the pad.
That's affirmative - -
And then I enter the P52.
That's correct.
Okay. Then enter the P52 and that's an option 3, right?
The P52 will be done as an option 1. The only reason you have the other REFSMMAT inside the computer is that in order to set the REFSMMAT flag, you need some relative orientation.
Okay. I see. I do a P52 option 1, and when do I set the REFSMMAT flag and the drift flag?
That will be before entering P52. I am going to give you this procedure in detail.
Okay. All right. Let's go at it. Maybe it'll all fall out and I won't have any questions. Go ahead.
Okay. I'm ready to start reading again. We start with a VERB 41 NOUN 20.
Okay. When the LM is in the Moon-viewing attitude, I do a VERB 41 NOUN 20, ENTER.
That's right. And you'll put in the attitudes that you'll get from one of the pads, and this will be for the coarse aline angles when the LM is at the Moon-viewing attitude. Then when they're all squared away, I tell you they have the right attitude; we then pick up again with a VERB 40 NOUN 20, ENTER.
Okay. VERB 40 NOUN 20, ENTER when Moon is - the LM is satisfied that they're at the Moon-viewing attitude.
That's correct. Now we're going to set the REFSMMAT and drift flags according to the G&C checklist, page G/7-1, steps 3 and 4.
Okay. Set the REFSMMAT flag for G&C 7-1, steps 3 and 4.
That's correct. Now VERB 37, ENTER; 52, ENTER; option 1.
VERB 37, ENTER; 52, ENTER; option 1.
That's correct. And we'll do the coarse aline.
Okay. Perform the coarse aline function.
Okay. Now when it gets back to the mark routines, we want to take a mark on the Moon.
Okay. Mark on the Moon with the crosshairs in the center. Is that right?
That's affirmative. Okay. When that's complete, the LM will maneuver to the Sun-viewing angle for attitude. And when they get there, you take a mark on the Sun using the Sun filter and the telescope; and, again, we're marking on the center.
Okay. Now, let me ask you a question. Is the first mark on the Moon made with the - are all these made with the telescope and not the sextant?
If - I'm not sure right offhand what the angular size of the Moon is, Jack. If you can get it in the sextant; that's the best thing to do, but you may have to go into the telescope in order to define the center. Either one's acceptable.
Okay. If I can define the center through the sextant, do it that way. And if I can't, use the telescope.
That's affirmed. We know you're going to use the telescope on the Sun.
Okay. You ready to press on?
I'm ready.
Okay. Just reminded we owe somebody a BAT B voltage.
Okay, another volts and amps coming up.
All right. Thank you. And this left us in P52 with two marks, and we'll go ahead and torque the NOUN 93s.
Okay. ... torque the NOUN 93s, after the two marks.
Okay. So that gives us a good platform. Now the LM will maneuver to the jettison attitude, and the only thing of significance here is that you want to watch to make sure that the path they choose to go to the jettison attitude avoids gimbal lock on your own platform.
Okay. The LM maneuvers to the jettison attitude and I just monitor the maneuver and yell at Jim if he gets near a gimbal lock.
That's affirmed. Okay, and then the LM will go to a MAX deadband attitude hold in the jettison attitude.
Okay. The LM goes to MAX deadband attitude hold.
Okay. Now we're ready to go back to work. The next thing we'll do is to continue to powerup procedures. Do you have any further questions on that alinement, Jack?
No. No. I think - I think it's all self-explanatory now.
Okay. The one thing that everybody would like for you to understand is we certainly don't insist on using the Moon and the Earth; if you find you have good stars, why use them. However, this alinement is more than adequate to give us a good guided entry.
Okay. If I get a set of good stars, do I start right out to a basic P51 and a P52 option 1?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Okay. Now, we're ready to go to work on panel 275. And it starts with a circuit breaker MAIN A - -
Wait - wait just a minute. Wait just a minute. I owe you some volts and amps.
Okay. All right.
Okay. Volts are 39.4, amps, 1.25.
Okay. I thought maybe, your meter was stuck before.
No (laughter).
All right. You ready to go back to 275? Have a circuit breaker MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed.
CB MAIN A, BAT BUS A, closed.
That's correct. And circuit breaker MAIN B, BAT C, closed.
CB MAIN Baker, BAT Charlie, closed.
Okay. That's correct. Now we're up to EI minus 1 plus 30. And at this time, we're going to proceed with the closeout and hatch installation.
Okay. Closeout and hatch installation at EI minus 01:30.
That's right, Jack, and we're going to close the LM hatch, and we'll make the dump valve in the LM hatch closed.
Understand you're going to close the dump valve, now on the LM hatch, right?
That's correct.
Okay. This is a change from what we had understood previously.
That's correct.
I'm - Personally, I'm happy to see it, but that's good.
Okay. That's one vote on your side. Okay; and we're going to go ahead and do the - use the decal to perform the hatch installation, and we'll start on the hatch integrity check.
Okay. Per the decal, perform the hatch installation and start on the hatch integrity check.
That's correct.
Okay, Ken. One thing I think that - I don't know whether anybody - the decal don't take into account the fact that we still have the umbilicals connected. At what point in time should they be removed?
Okay, Jack. That doesn't matter. We're going to be separating the tunnel upstream of those umbilicals, and you can leave them right there.
Okay. Does it make any difference if we disengage - the LM - We have pulled the circuit breakers LM POWER-1 and -2, so if we choose to disconnect these umbilicals, there's no harm, right?
That's right. No sweat. John Aaron's just saying that they may be hot. He's checking on it, so how about holding a decision on that and let me come back to you?
Okay.
Okay. And let me tell you what we're going to do since we told you a different story this afternoon on this tunnel. We're actually going to vent the tunnel down so that we end up with about 1-1/2 to 2 psi absolute in the tunnel. And this will give us a DELTA-P of 3. So we'll do our hatch integrity check at the same time we're venting the tunnel down.
Okay. It sounds good.
Okay. Now let me give you some plumbing switches here. Let's take the SURGE TANK OXYGEN valve to ON.
SURGE TANK O<sub>2</sub> to ON.
All right. Take the MAIN REGs, two, OPEN.
MAIN REGs, two, to OPEN.
Okay. And the WATER AND GLYCOL TANK PRESSURE, the PRESSURE valve and the RELIEF valve to BOTH.
Okay, WATER AND GLYCOL TANKS PRESSURE and RELIEF valve to BOTH.
That's correct. And EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE valve to BOTH.
EMERGENCY CABIN PRESSURE to BOTH.
That's correct; and the SUIT DEMAND REGs to BOTH.
SUIT DEMAND REGs to BOTH.
That's correct. Okay, now we're going to panel 5: circuit breaker ECS TRANSDUCERs, PRESSURE GROUP 1 and 2, MAIN A and MAIN B. That's four circuit breakers, closed.
ECS TRANSDUCERs, GROUP 1 and 2, MAIN A and MAIN B, four, to close.
That's correct. Okay, now. Circuit breaker ECS TRANSDUCER, TEMPERATURE, MAIN A and MAIN B, that's two of them, closed.
CB ECS TRANSDUCER, TEMPERATURE, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
That's correct. On panel 4: PRIMARY ECS GLYCOL PUMPS, one, to AC 1.
Primary ECS GLYCOL PUMPS to 1, AC1.
That's correct. Okay, then we'll finish going back to the tunnel vent, and verify the LM/CM DELTA-P and make sure it's been holding pressure. And we'll come back again and rehash all of the hatch integrity check and tunnel vent procedures with you. The next thing I want to read off is the EI minus 1 plus 20. We'll go to panel 7: BMAG number 1 POWER to WARM UP.
BMAG number 1 POWER to WARM UP.
That's correct. Then at EI minus 1 plus 10, we'll perform SCS powerup per checklist, page G/2-4.
Okay. Perform SCS powerup per G&C checklist, page 2-4.
That's correct. Okay, on panel 4: SUIT COMPRESSOR NUMBER 2 to AC1.
SUIT COMPRESSOR 2 to IC1.
That's correct. SPACECRAFT CONTROL to SCS.
SPACECRAFT CONTROL to SCS.
Okay. And your MANUAL ATTITUDE switches, as you desire. We're coming up on jettison of the LM, so that's just like separation.
Okay.
Okay. And we'll do a GDC aline.
Okay. Perform a GDC aline.
Okay. On panel 8: ROTATION CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, 1 and 2, MAIN A/MAIN B.
Okay. These are circuit breakers, ROTATION CONTROL POWER, DIRECT, 1 and 2, MAIN A and MAIN B, closed.
Okay, Jack. I was thinking switch. Let me verify that's a circuit breaker, too. I think we have to get both of them.
Okay, there's those four circuit breakers over there, Ken. When you said panel 8, that's what I thought you were talking about. I don't think the circuit breakers are out right now, but why don't we just put - verify the circuit breakers and put the switches to MAIN A/MAIN B.
Okay, that's correct, Jack. Okay, at EI minus 1 hour, we're going to be doing the LM jettison; so just prior to that, we want to do a P47.
Okay, say at about 1 minute prior to LM jettison, huh?
Yes, just something that's comfortable for you.
Okay.
All right, after we've? done that, we want to get panel 8, SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, two of them, ON.
Okay. I get a GO from MSFN for this?
Okay, John says we can watch it.
Okay.
All right; the next thing is CSM/LM FINAL SEP, two of them, ON, up.
CSM/LM FINAL SEP, two, ON.
That's correct. Now we're going back to panel 8, and it's SEQUENTIAL, PYRO ARM, two of them, to SAFE.
Okay. SEQ PYRO ARM, two, to SAFE.
That's correct, and go back to P00.
Okay. Go to P00.
All right. And now it's time to configure for single ring.
Okay. Configure for single ring RCS.
That's right, and since you're still an hour from EI, I guess it wouldn't hurt to use MINIMUM IMPULSE or something like that rather than the DAP, at least not until you get closer down. We'll have the DAP loads for you later.
... - -
Okay. And as soon as you've gotten yourself all set up with a good control mode, you want to maneuver to the entry attitude.
Maneuver to entry attitude per the pad.
That's correct. And we show EI minus 55, which really means when you get to the entry attitude, we have a sextant star check for you. And that will be on the pad.
Okay. Perform a sextant star check.
Okay. And I want to remind you to park the optics at 90 degrees of shaft.
Okay. Say again why, Ken. I didn't understand that.
Okay, this is just a precaution, Jack. If we park the optics with a 90-degree shaft angle, that will line up the slits so it gives you the best airflow over that part of the heat shield and avoids a hot spot. If you don't remember it, I don't think it makes much difference. It's just good procedure.
Okay.
Okay. And after you've got it parked wherever you want it, well, turn the OPTICS POWER OFF and stow the optics.
Okay. OPTICS POWER, OFF; stow the optics.
Okay, that's good, Okay. The next thing we'll do is to initialize the EMS and that's on entry checklist page 2-1, step number 2.
Okay, perform EMS initialization per entry checklist page 2-1, step 2.
Okay, that's correct. Now we're coming up on EI minus 45 minutes, and we'll give you an entry pad and a final state vector.
Okay, at minus 45, entry pad and final state vector from MSFN.
Okay. Now we're going to perform what we call the Moon check. Rather than go into detail, if you already know what we're doing, just say so; otherwise, I'll describe the use of the Moon-attitude set.
Maybe you better describe it.
Okay, Jack. You remember everybody in the past has commented on seeing Moonset just a couple minutes prior to EI, and your horizon will probably be dark at the time that you get there; you're having an early morning entry; and coming in from the west, you'll still be looking at a dark horizon. So, just as a backup technique, just like you would track the horizon, we're going to give you an attitude which will be on the pad so that you can look directly at the Moon. This is an inertial attitude; it won't be changing, and you'll put the 36-degree window line on the Moon, and then just sit there and watch it. And just prior to EI, the Earth will come up and occult it, and you will then have a good horizon check. And I have some times, and I'll give you that later. And if you just look at this thing now, at that point you can set the GDC or whatever you desire. And you will have a known attitude reference. It's just like a horizon check.
Okay, I maneuver to the Moon check attitude; at which time I put the 36 window line on the Moon, and just prior to EI, the Earth will occult the Moon.
That's correct. And that corresponds to the same inertial attitude that you'd have on the back of your entry card where it shows the horizon attitude several minutes prior to EI; it's the same thing.
Yes, that's that one at 17 minutes prior. Okay.
Okay, and we're just getting it in a little closer. Okay, the next item on the check - checklist here is an EI minus 40; we're going to panel 7, and it's BMAG NUMBER 2 POWER to WARM UP.
Okay, panel 7: BMAG NUMBER 2 POWER to WARM UP.
That's correct. Now, I'd like to verify the SURGE TANK and REPRESS PACKAGES are ON.
Verify SURGE TANK and REPRESS PACKAGE are ON.
That's correct. On panel 5: circuit breaker ENVIRONMENTAL - CONTROL SYSTEM; WASTE WATER/URINE DUMP HEATER, two of them, closed.
Panel 5: CB ECS, WASTE H<sub>2</sub>O/URINE DUMP HEATERS, two, to close.
That's correct. SUIT COMPRESSOR number 2 to OFF.
SUIT COMPRESSOR 2 to OFF.
That's right, Jack, and what this - what we're planning to do in order to conserve power is we're going to run the suit compressor from an hour to this point at minus 40. And we'll be watching the PCO<sub>2</sub>; if that thing's working, we'll turn it off at the earliest time that we have a good cabin, and then we'll just leave it off. And in the event that the PCO<sub>2</sub> gage isn't working properly or something like that, well, we'll just go ahead and run it for this time frame.
Okay, that sounds good.
All right. Now we're at EI minus 30. SEQUENTIAL, LOGIC, that's two of them, to ON, up.
EI minus 30; SEQ, LOGIC, two, ON.
Okay, in panel 7: the BMAG number 2 POWER to ON.
Okay, we - you only gave that 10 minutes for the warmup, huh?
That's okay.
Okay.
All right, and FDAI POWER to BOTH.
FDAI POWER to BOTH.
Okay. And we want to activate the primary evaporator.
Okay, activate the primary evaporator. All this time, Ken, what've we been getting our cooling? Right now, I think we have the radiators at PULL TO BYPASS.
That's correct. We started out that way, and we turned the glycol pumps on, and we're just circulating it internally. And we're counting on the command module being a heat sink; it's pretty cold soaked, and it looks like this is good enough. You got some relatively low heat loads - -
Okay.
- - and we'll keep watching the temps, and if we need it, why we'll start the evaporator early.
Okay, that sounds good.
Do you believe it's cold up there?
Yes, and we used to call the command module the bedroom and it's now the refrigerator.
Okay, just don't call it the reefer. Okay. At about EI minus 19, we get back into the standard entry checklist on page 2-2, where it starts with P61.
Okay, at EI minus 19, we get back into the entry checklist at page 2-2, where we start entering P61.
Okay, Jack. Now that's the - those are the time-line notes I had for you. I hate to tell you this, but I also have a couple of corrections to make to the entry checklist. They aren't corrections, they just are pieces of the entry checklist which will correspond to what I've written - already read to you. And I'm ready to go on that whenever you are. And Vance tells me you can get into the descent water for drinking now.
We can get into the descent water for drinking, huh?
Yes.
Sounds good.
Hey, go to it.
Jim would like to know whether the descent water will be good until LM jettison?
Okay, Jack. Looks like we're going to go on the ascent tanks at 128:30. And it looks like - -
Okay, understand. We are going - -
- - you have plenty of water. I'm sorry we cut each other out; say again.
Okay, yes. I was going to say, understand we're going to go on the ascent tanks at 128:30.
That's right; based on the current rate, that's what they predict and you can go ahead and drink the water. No sweat.
Okay, real fine. And I've got the entry checklist out and I'm ready to copy; just give me the page.
Okay. Jack, you're starting to sound like an LMP.
I think I'm probably the only CMP that's ever witnessed an - a LM burn from inside the LM in - in space flight.
(Laughter) I hope it stays that way. Okay, Jack, we're starting on page 1-1.
Go ahead.
Okay, down in the middle of the page on line 9, we're just going to strike out the "Activate VHF for COMM checks," and line 10, "Verify the DSE." We're going to leave the DSE OFF, and that's to save power, as is the VHF activation.
Okay.
Okay, on page 1-2. At minus 2 hours, there's a title "Logic sequence" check; and we're deleting that entire sequence; that's included in what I read up to you.
Okay, delete the logic sequence check at minus 2 hours there.
That's correct. And delete lines 23, 24, and 25. That means a maneuver to SUPERCIRC entry attitude. Everything below that is deleted.
Okay. Delete lines 23 through 28.
That's correct. You got ahead of me. All right, on line 29 on page 1-3, we're going to put in a time of minus 00:55. That's the time we gave you for the boresight check.
Okay - -
That's your sextant check, really.
Got that.
Okay, on the top of page 1-4; where it said "1 hour and 15 minutes" next to line 32, we're going to change that to "Minus 2 hours and 30 minutes."
Okay, minus 02:30 opposite item 32.
Okay, down at the bottom of the EMS entry check right there where we are, the bottom line now reads, "EMS MODE to STANDBY." Well, just above that - like to remind you to put a remark, "Do not initialize the range to go." This is because you're going to come into the EMS entry check, you're going to run through all these things; then we're going to remove power from the EMS. And just didn't want you to get ahead of yourself and initialize the entry parameters, because you'll lose them when we power up.
Okay.
And, after we go EMS MODE to STANDBY, like for you to add "Circuit breaker EMS, two, to open."
Okay, "CB EMS, two, to open."
That's correct. And we want to delete this "Set up camera" that's listed on the bottom of the page. We're deleting that for power reasons. That's line 33 Alfa.
Okay, we're way ahead of you. We already got it stowed.
Okay. On the top of the next page where it says "Secondary water EVAP," just keep in mind we don't plan to use the secondary evaporators unless the primary fails. On line 35 on page 1-5, next to "Command module RCS preheat," the time is now "Minus 06:30."
Okay, "minus 06:30," and the voltage reading 3.9 still is good, right?
Okay, very good. Under "Final stowage," the first thing that's listed on line 36, page 1-5, is "Optics." And if you want to get started on your stowage, we'd like to leave the optics out, because we'll have the star check coming up quite a bit after this. The rest of that stuff can be taken care of at your convenience.
Okay.
All right, still on pace 1-5, line 37; the time is now "Minus 06:10."
Got that.
Okay, and this is one time it looks like we might actually do the preheat, so that's the reason we want to make sure that we know that not more than 20 minutes of time on the preheat. We may not be able to watch it at that time because you aren't powered up.
Okay. Either 20 minutes or until 3.9 volts DC.
That's correct, Jack. And now let's go to page 1-6. And about one-third of the way down, it shows "Panel 275 CB MAIN A, BAT C, closed," we want to strike off that line, the next two lines, and we're going to strike out "MAIN A, BAT C, closed; MAIN B, BAT C, closed; and DC INDICATOR, MAIN B."
Okay. After that step on panel 275, strike out "CB MAIN A, BAT C; CB MAIN B, BAT C; and DC INDICATORS to MAIN B."
That's correct. Now reader panel 8, it tells you to "Close all circuit breakers EXCEPT," and I have four additions. The first one is CB SERVICE MODULE RCS HEATERS, QUAD Charlie, MAIN B, open.
SERVICE MODULE RCS HEATERS, QUAD Charlie, MAIN Baker, open.
Okay. And the same thing for SERVICE MODULE RCS HEADERS, QUAD Delta, MAIN A, open.
SERVICE MODULE RCS HEATERS, QUAD Delta, MAIN A, open.
That's correct. And Circuit breaker EMS, that's two of them, open.
CB EMS, two, to open.
All right. And the last is the circuit breakers for SPS GAGING, four of them, open.
SPS GAGING, four to open.
Okay. And how about our readout on the battery and that charger?
Okay, BAT's at volts and amps.
That's affirmed. And let's go back to page 1-6, line 41. Let's put in a time "Minus 04:40."
Minus 04:40.
That's correct. On page 2-1, line number 2, put in a time of "Minus 55 minutes."
Okay, minus 55 minutes.
Okay. And the first thing you want to do under "EMS initialization," is circuit breakers EMS, that's two of them, to close.
Okay. CB EMS, two, to close.
That's correct. All right. Line 4 or step 4, where it shows "CM RCS check." That occurs at minus 04:30.
Okay. Minus 04:30.
All right. Under "CM RCS checks," the fourth line down says "MANUAL ATTITUDE, three, to MINIMUM IMPULSE." We'll have to use "ACCEL COMMAND" and the reason for that, Jack, is we don't have the SPS powered up so there's no minimum impulse generator.
Okay. MANUAL ATTITUDE, three, to ACCEL COMMAND.
That's correct. And on the same page 2-1, strike out the last three lines, starting with "RCS transfer to service module."
Right. The last three lines are scratched out. We ain't got one of those things.
That's correct. Okay, let's flip to page 2-2 and strike out the first two lines.
Okay. Now wait a second. I need to give you volts and amps, Ken.
All right. Go ahead.
Okay. It's 39.6, 1.12.
Sounds like you're getting there. Okay. I believe we scratched out the first two lines on 2-2. Now, we're - right below that, it says "Separation checklist." So we're going to just delete that whole thing; it's included in the notes I gave you.
Okay. It's included in the notations.
All right. Line number 7. It says "Maneuver to horizon check attitude." We're going to call this the "Moon-check attitude" and this is the one we discussed, Jack. The angle of 265 is not correct. I'll have one of those for you first thing in the morning.
Okay.
Okay. And at the bottom of the page, step number 1. That will be at EI minus 19 minutes, and we're off and running through a normal sequence of events.
Okay. That sounds good. Ken, I guess if you've read this thing - Is it a comfortable time line? Any areas where you had problems with?
Jack, it is very comfortable. We've run it several times now and, in fact, it's being run right now, again. And we've run it both here at Houston and at the Cape. The only place where you might find that you need to stay ahead of things is during the platform-alinement period, when you're getting ready to close out the LM and then once you get into the command module and jettison the LM, why you're back on a very comfortable time. And, of course, we'll be watching and anything we can do, like keeping track of time for you, we'll remind you of that as we go along.
Hey, that would be good - that would be good, Ken.
Okay. Let me emphasize, Jack, that 2-1/2 hours is the earliest time we can start in on that powerup stuff. Everything else you can do the way you normally would, where you get as far ahead of the game as you can. But the 2-1/2-hour time is based on saving command module consumables. And if you do that, why we're fat; we've got plenty of time to give you some fans on the water even. So that's the one point you don't want to start early on. I do have a couple of more lines to run through on the entry checklist and two pages in the G&C. And I think that will clean us up.
Okay, Ken. And G&C checklist now?
Let me finish a couple more things in the entry book. You still got that?
Yes. Go ahead.
Okay. On - These are just cleanup items, Jack. On page 2-3, it lists how you separate, from the CM/SM SEP and all that, so, obviously, if we're on step 5 at 43 minutes down - that's all deleted. And that gets deleted all the way over onto page 2-4, up to the line where it says "15 minutes." And at that point, we pick back up and everything. From 15 minutes down is valid.
Okay. Delete item 5 down to the point where it says "Minus 15 minutes."
That's correct, Jack. Okay, on page 2-5. The top line where we had "Horizon check," that's now the "Moonset check" and the time is approximately 57:37. And that's minus 02:23. And that angle that's listed in the book there - 177 - that's really a horizon time at 2 minutes; we'll have you - can look that up on the back of your entry cue card, and I'll look that number up again for you tonight.
Okay.
Okay. Another thing is to remember when we begin blackout, which is around 05g, and you can write this in your checklist wherever it's convenient; once we've lost COMM, we're going to go ahead and power down the SCE POWER OFF and the PMP POWER OFF. And we just want to do that after you lose COMM, which comes up around EI. Any time after that, go ahead and secure the PMP and the SCE power.
Okay. When COMM is lost, SCE POWER OFF, PMP POWER OFF.
That's correct, Jack, and that completes the entry checklist. Let's look at the G&C book.
Okay. Ready to copy.
Okay. Let's go to page 2-1.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. The second line under "IMU powerup" says "FDAI POWER to BOTH," and we're going to make that a "1." The reason we're doing that is, again, to conserve power. There's no reason to drive the second FDAI before we get that information to put on it.
Okay. "FDAI POWER to 1."
All right. That's correct. On page 2-2.
Go ahead.
Okay. Under CMC powerup, line - or step 2 says "Flashing 3700, ENTER." The time we're going to use this, Jack, is going to be when you've just brought the computer up and it has a state vector in it that's way back many, many hours ago. So we want to do a VERB 96, ENTER to stop the integration to keep it from just sitting there ambling along. And when the ground gives you a new state vector, why then we can go through P00 and we'll be back in business.
Okay. You want me to go to VERB 37, ENTER; 00, ENTER; and then do a VERB 96?
When you come up, I guess you're going to - once you get the CMC powered up, you're probably going to be going - you're going to come up in a flashing 37, and if you'll just do a VERB 96, ENTER right there, that will take care of it.
Okay.
All right. And the last one I have for you is on page 2-4.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Under the SCS powerup, the first line says "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, to OFF." Okay. You can just delete that part. On the fifth line, it says "Circuit breaker SCS LOGIC POWER," that's really "LOGIC BUS, four of them, to closed." The DELTA-V CG is not important since we are not burning the engine. The "SIGNAL CONDITIONER/DRIVER BIAS POWER" lists "Two to AC 1." We are going to make that just one of them; make it "SIGNAL CONDITION/DRIVER BIAS POWER, one, to AC 1." The "BMAG POWER," which is the third line from the bottom, says "BMAG POWER, two, ON;" we are going to make that just one. We'll bring up number 1, and we'll make "FDAI POWER, number 1" and the last line "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, enable," you can strike that off and replace it with "BMAG MODE, three of them, to RATE 1." You want to try reading that back?
Okay. Delete "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, OFF." Change "CB LOGIC POWER" to "LOGIC THRUST POWER - CBS CS LOGIC THRUST, four, to closed." Delete "DELTA-V CG," coming down here "SIGNAL CONDITIONER/DRIVER BIAS POWER, one, AC 1; BMAG POWER, 1, to ON," and it's the number 1 BMAG. "FDAI POWER to 1; BMAG MODE, three, to RATE 1," deleting the "AUTO RCS SELECT, 16, to enable."
That's correct. You've got them all, Jack. Very good. Thank you.
Thank you. This does it, huh?
Yes, sir. Let's see - just a second - let me check on this hatch and integrity check maybe I can tell you something about that. And I do have an answer to your LM power question about the umbilicals. The umbilicals will be unpowered according to the LM procedures, so if you'd like to disconnect them, you can.
Okay. I think we will.
All right, sir. Okay, Jack, and they'd like us to stand by just a second.
Jack, would you get the BATTERY CHARGER, OFF, please. And we'll send you - -
Okay.
- - the rest of that procedure later.
You mean there's more? Okay, in work. BATTERY CHARGER is going OFF.
Right.
Okay, Vance. Okay - I don't think you've given me the backout procedure, have you, for the battery chargers?
That's negative. Wait. All we want to do, Jack, is say BATTERY CHARGE OFF at the moment. We'll complete that procedure as soon as you are through with Ken completely.
Okay, Vance. The BATTERY CHARGER's OFF, and I'm ready to continue with Ken.
Okay, Jack. And we'll get the backout to you after that.
Okay, Jack. It looks like we've closed up the loose ends here. Amazingly enough, out of all that stuff, it looks like we only generated one question on the floor, and we'll research that one. We'll even let you guess what it might have been. If you have any questions, after you mull it over, why, we're always available. Just ask us what you're thinking about.
Okay. That's what we're going to do. We're going to wait until the LM people get theirs, and then we're going to discuss it and coordinate things here, and make sure that - that we don't have any interface problems. And, if we have any more questions, we'll be coming back at you.
Okay. We did run the thing integrated, so we think we've got all the little surprises ironed out for you.
I hope so because tomorrow is examination time.
Roger.
Ken, this is Jim.
Yes, sir.
Appreciate the work you've done, and Jack says that it's going to be hard to beat his record about saving SM RCS fuel all the way there and back.
I can't do much about that.
Some people will do anything to set a record.
Hey, Jim, you even did good on service module fuel this time.
Yes. We're coming back with a full load almost of both RCS and SPS, that's - That's pretty much of a record.
Okay. Did you want to put Fred-o on, or somebody to copy the LM - the LM side of the house.
Hey, Jack. Don't wake him up yet. Stand by 1.
He's - He's awake.
Hey, Jack. We'll give you this battery charging backout procedure, and then Deke says you ought to get some sleep. You're going to need it tomorrow.
Okay. I'm ready to copy the backout procedure.
Okay. Panel 3: BATTERY CHARGE, OFF - you've already done that, Jack - next AC INVERTER, INVERTER 2 OFF: Panel 5: MAIN BUS TIE BAT B/C to BAT B/C. Huh? Yes, it's up - the up position. Panel 250: circuit breaker, BAT A POWER ENTRY/ POSTLANDING to open; circuit breaker, BAT B POWER ENTRY/POSTLANDING, open, Panel 5: CB BATTERY CHARGER BAT B CHARGE, open. Okay. I'll let you read that back, Jack.
Okay. BAT CHARGE, OFF; AC INVERTER 2 to OFF; MAIN BUS TIE, BAT B/C to on, up. Panel 250: BAT A, POWER ENTRY AND POSTLANDING, open; CB, BAT B, POWER ENTRY and POSTLANDING, open. Panel 5: CB BAT CHARGER, BAT B CHARGED, open.
Okay. That's correct. Now, that gets you back to the place where you can back out of the - the big battery charging procedure, which you have. And I - I think you have the backout procedure for that, but I'd like to check with you.
Okay. Stand by here.
Okay, Jack. Do you have that backout procedure in your hand there?
Yes, I do, Vance.
Okay. Just to verify. It starts out panel 3, BATTERY CHARGE switch, OFF; AC INVERTER 2, OFF; panel 5, MAIN BUS TIE, BAT A/C, on, up, et cetera.
Roger. Continues CB BAT A, POWER ENTRY/ POSTLANDING, open; INVERTER POWER 2, MAIN B, open; and then you reverse the steps that you had for entering the procedure.
Yes, that's fine. Okay. And we have one other comment regarding the systems checklist, and stand by 1, and that'll - that'll wrap it up for us. Oh, a new item came in, Jack. We need to switch to ascent water, and I have a three-step procedure for you, if you're ready to copy.
Okay. Jim will copy that.
Okay. DESCENT WATER valve, CLOSE. ASCENT WATER valve to CLOSE, and WATER TANK SELECT valve to ASCENT.
Okay, Vance. DESCENT WATER valve, closed; ASCENT WATER valve, closed; and WATER SELECT TANK to ASCENT. Is that correct?
WATER TANK SELECT valve, ASCENT. That's correct, Jim.
And we'll proceed with that right now, and how about still drinking descent water?
Jim, we understand that you should be able to continue drinking, it.
Okay. We switched to ascent water, but we'll probably have to have the descent water valve back open up again to drink water.
That's affirm. That's the one thing you'll have to do is, whenever you want to drink out of the descent tank, is open the descent valve - the DESCENT WATER valve momentarily.
Okay. And we are now on ascent water.
Okay; okay. And I need Jack back again, please.
Okay, Vance. I'm here, and you have something in the systems checklist.
That's right. Refer to S/2-6. This - Really what we're talking about, Jack, is the hatch integrity check decal. And I think it'll be easiest, if you'll open to S/2-6 and I explain it to you.
Okay, Vance. I'm ready to copy.
Okay. This will - This just involves changes. Look down to the third line where it says "TUNNEL VENT valve, TUNNEL VENT for 30 seconds;" cross out "30 seconds" and cross out the two lines below that. In other words, "LM CSM DELTA-P. Check DELTA-P and recycle to TUNNEL VENT."
Okay. You want me to delete "For 30 seconds."
That's affirm. And the two lines below "30 seconds." And actually the part of the fourth line there, which is "8-1/2 minutes."
Stand by. Can you read okay?
Yes. I hear you now.
Okay. Delete the two lines below that, or the two-and-a-half lines below that, also.
That's affirm. And now, we have an addition to put in place of what we deleted. Stand by 1; the COMM's bad. How do you read?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Okay. We want you to vent - tunnel vent until, and add the following, "Until LM/CM DELTA-P is equal to 3.0 psid."
Okay. "Until LM/CM DELTA-P equals 3.0."
Okay. And that means that you'll have a pressure of 1.5 to 2 in the tunnel, absolute. That's - -
Okay.
That's a note.
Jack, that's what we want to end up with ultimately is 1-1/2 to 2 there in that tunnel and depending on the gage reading, but that should be about 3.
Okay, Deke.
Okay, then, Jack. Continuing on, everything's okay until you get down to - on the next page, you get through "Verify O<sub>2</sub> FLOW INDICATOR no increase." We would like to delete everything below that, until the last step, which is TUNNEL LIGHTS, OFF. So starting with "Before undocking only," delete all lines through "TUNNEL VENT VALVE to TUNNEL VENT."
Okay. Delete the section that says "Before un-docking only" down to where it says "TUNNEL VENT VALVE to TUNNEL VENT."
Yes, through that.
Well, through that. Leave "TUNNEL LIGHTS OFF" is the only step remaining.
Roger. And just - That's a verify.
Okay. Got that.
Okay. Really what this does for you, then, is it gives you a pressure - a tunnel pressure integrity - or a hatch pressure integary - integrity check with a DELTA-P of 3 psi between the tunnel and the cabin. And then you never go on to the steps of venting that on out. You just leave it in there for the time that you separate from the LM. And that gives you a shotgun DELTA-V effect.
Okay. Copy that.
Okay. I think that's all, but we're polling the house here to see if there's another comment for you. Stand by.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Vance.
Jack, that's it. Unless you have any more questions, why, everyone is hoping you'll hit the sack and get some rest.
Okay. You want that battery backout procedure now to take that - to complete the remaining steps?
That's affirm, Jack. We request that you go ahead and finish out the backout completely until you get to square 1. Over.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Jim.
Do you have any more updates for us?
We've still got a LM update, but we strongly recommend that you and Jack work as hard as you can sleeping for about the next 5 hours. Fred can handle it.
Okay. That's what we'll do. We'll put Fred on watch here, and Jack and I will take it easy, and if Fred copies the LM update, well, then we'll all start from fresh in the morning.
You bet.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
All right, go ahead, Vance.
Okay, Fred. Two - three things. First thing is we need a docking angle check as soon as you can conveniently get it. Second point, you're free to drink all the descent stage water you want, if that wasn't clear before. And the third point, if you have a piece of paper, stand by to get writer's cramps. We have something to give you here.
Okay. You want the - again a look at the docking tunnel index?
Why don't you go ahead and look at that - -
... - -
Look at that first, yes.
Okay.
Okay. Jim says the docking tunnel index is a plus 2.1 degrees.
Okay. Plus 2.1 degrees, docking tunnel index.
Okay. He corrects himself. He says make that sign a minus. Minus 2.1 degrees.
Okay. We just changed, plus to minus.
Okay. And your second item was, we can drink all of that descent waster that's left - looks like about 5 percent, and I'll get a book here and be ready to start writing.
Okay. Get - This won't be as long as - as the one T. K. read up, but you'll need several pages, probably.
Okay. I've got lots of pages here of Ken's photo log set to go.
Okay, Fred-o. Okay. This is "Entry, LM PREP." Starts EI minus 6 hours. At that time, you power up the ACS. I think I'll give you a line at a time and, when I hear you say okay on that, I'll go to the next. That sound reasonable?
Okay. I'll go hot mike briefly.
Okay. BAT 5 -
Hey, how do you read now?
Okay. I read you okay, Fred. Okay. Battery 5 - -
Okay ...
Battery 5 NORMAL FEED ON is the first step.
Okay, Vance. That - Go ahead.
Okay. Use modified LM DPS/RCS 30-minute activation checklist.
Okay.
EI minus 5 hours. Midcourse-7, if required. Next: LM preentry procedure. And, Fred, the time on LM preentry procedure is just - -
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. The time on the LM preentry procedure is just as soon as you finish midcourse-7, or 5 hours -
All right, go ahead, Vance.
Okay.
Okay. I've got this TEI minus 5 hours, MCC-7 if required, and now you're going to start me a new procedure called LM preentry procedure. Go ahead.
Roger. Maneuver to SM SEP attitude. Configure for CSM hotfire.
Okay.
Under that, DEADBAND, MAX; and ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, to PULSE.
Okay.
Perform CSM hotfire. Maneuver back to SM SEP attitude.
Okay.
And under that, ATTITUDE CONTROL, PITCH and ROLL, PULSE; YAW, MODE CONTROL.
Okay. Next, EI minus 4 hours, 30 minutes. Configure for CM/SM SEP.
Okay. Hold on a minute.
Okay.
That was EI - EI minus 4-1/2?
That's correct.
Okay. That's EI minus 4-1/2 hours, configure for SM SEP.
That's affirm, and under that, BALANCE COUPLE, ON.
Okay.
AGS 404, plus 0; 405, plus 0; 406, plus 0; and 470, read out.
Okay. Got it.
Translate plus-X at 0.5 feet per second.
Okay.
Then CM/SM SEP. After SEP, null 470 - -
Okay. stand by 1.
Okay.
Okay. Go ahead.
After SEP, null 470 to 0.
Okay.
ATTITUDE CONTROL, three of them, to PULSE.
Okay.
Pitch to acquire service module for photos.
Okay.
Okay. Note: use ACA for control.
Okay. We can use the ACA now for control.
Roger. EI minus 3 hours, maneuver and ATT HOLD for Moon view, attitude - -
Wait a minute. Was that maneuver in ATT HOLD for Moon view. Is that right?
For - That's affirm. - For Moon view attitude until CM platform release.
Okay. It says maneuver in ATT HOLD for Moon view attitude until CM platform release.
That's affirm. Better worded, it would have been maneuver and hold in attitude for Moon view, et cetera.
Okay. That's mainly for Jack to be able to get it in the optics, you mean.
Yes, that's correct. Okay, Fred - -
Okay.
Could you give us a readback on everything up to this point?
Okay. I'll go back to NORMAL VOICE. It might - Or is this pretty clear?
It's clear.
Okay. The master title, "Entry, LM PREP, EI minus 6 hours." First, BAT 5 NORMAL FEED, ON; second, use modified LM DPS/RCS, 30-minute activation checklist. Next, is at TEI minus 5 hours, MCC-7, if required. Now, we have a LM preentry procedure. First, we maneuver to service module SEP attitude. Second, configure for CSM hotfire. Under that, DEADBAND MAX, and ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, to PULSE. Thirdly, perform CSM hotfire. Fourth, we - The LM maneuvers back to SM SEP attitude, with ATTITUDE CONTROLs, PITCH and ROLL to PULSE, ATTITUDE CONTROL, YAW, to MODE CONTROL. Now, you got that so far, Vance?
That's correct so far, Fred-o.
Okay. At EI minus 4-1/2 hours, configure for SM SEP. First, BALANCE COUPLE, ON. Secondly, zero the counters in AGS; 404, 405, 406, plus 0; read out 470. Thirdly, translate plus-X to 0.5 foot per second. Fourth, CM/SM SEP. Fifth, after SEP, null 470 to 0. Sixth, ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, to PULSE. Seventh, pitch to acquire service module for photos. And a note, use the ACA for control. Last, we had - you gave me was TEI minus 3 hours. Maneuver in ATT HOLD for Moon view until the CM platform release.
Okay, Fred. Only - Only a minor point that we just picked up. At the very top, EI minus 6 hours, the title is "power up," above BAT 5 NORMAL FEED, ON.
Okay. The title above BAT 5 NORMAL FEED, ON, is "power up."
Okay. And on the last, it was maneuver and ATT HOLD for Moon view attitude until CM platform release. I think that's what you read. Okay. Ready to go on? EI minus - Are you there?
Okay. Next is - Okay. Next is TEI minus what, Vance?
It's - It's EI minus 2-1/2 hours, Fred.
Okay. EI minus 2-1/2.
Okay. The title, "Power removal from CM LM umbilical."
Okay. "Power removal from CM LM umbilical."
That's correct. Next, assumes - This assumes all descent batteries on line.
Okay. I'll put that as a note.
And ASCENT BATTERIES 5 and 6 on NORMAL FEED.
Okay. This assumes all descent BATs on line, and ASCENT BATs 5 and 6 on NORMAL FEED. Go ahead.
Roger. Next, CSM CB LM POWER 1, MAIN B to open.
Okay. CSM, CB LM POWER 1, MAIN B, open.
Next. CB, LM POWER 2, MAIN B, open.
Okay. CSM, CB LM POWER 2, MAIN B, open.
CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B to open.
Okay. CB EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open.
Okay. Next, the LM. CB, EPS panels 11 and 16, CROSS TIE BALANCE LOADS to close.
Okay. On the LM side now. CB EPS 11, panels 11 and 16, CROSS TIE BAL LOADS, close.
That's correct. Next, CB EPS panel 16, BAT FEED TIE, two of them, open.
Okay. LM, CB EPS, panel 16, BAT FEED TIE, two, open.
Okay. CB EPS 16, ASCENT ECA CONTROL to close.
Okay. CB EPS panel 16, ASCENT ECA CONTROL, close.
Correct. BATTERY 1, HI VOLT - HIGH VOLTAGE to OFF/RESET.
Okay. BATTERY 1, HI VOLT, OFF/RESET.
BATTERY 5, OFF/RESET.
Okay. BATTERY 5, HI VOLT - or, it should be BATTERY 5 NORMAL FEED to OFF/RESET.
Roger. And - Stand by.
Or did you mean battery 2?
Yes. I think that's what he meant.
Okay. We mean BATTERY 5 to OFF/RESET.
Okay.
That's a NORMAL FEED.
BATTERY 5, NORMAL FEED - NORMAL FEED, OFF/RESET. Got you.
Okay. BAT 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET then ON.
Okay. BATTERY 2, LOW VOLT, OFF/RESET, then ON.
Next. BAT 2, HI VOLT, OFF/RESET, then ON.
Okay. You still there, Vance?
Roger. I didn't catch your readback, Fred.
Oh, okay. The last item was item 9, and that was BAT 2, LOW VOLT, OFF/RESET, then ON.
Roger. After that, I gave another one. BAT 2, HI VOLT, OFF/RESET, then ON.
Okay. BAT 2, HI VOLT, OFF/RESET, then ON.
Correct. BAT 1, HI VOLT, ON.
Okay. BAT 1, HI VOLT, ON.
BAT 5, NORMAL FEED, ON.
Okay. BAT 5, NORMAL FEED, ON.
CB, EPS, 16, BAT FEED TIE, two of them, closed.
Okay. CB, EPS, 16, BAT FEED TIE, two, closed.
Roger. Next. The LMP should transfer to the CM.
Okay. I'll underline that one. LMP transfer to CM.
Don't let them forget you.
Okay. And just before LMP transfer to CM, we'd like to have you add another step, Fred. That is - -
Go ahead.
That is, CB, EPS, ASCENT ECA CONTROL, open.
Okay. You want CB - CB, EPS, that's on 16, I assume, ASCENT ECA CONTROL, open.
Affirm. Okay. This is EI minus 1 hour 45 minutes, next.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Maneuver to CM LM JETT attitude.
And you'll have a pad for that attitude.
Okay. Maneuver to CM LM JETT attitude.
That's affirm. Matter of fact, Jack has a listing of your pads there, Fred-o, so you can review them after this is over.
Okay.
EI minus 1 hour 35 minutes. Configure - -
- - EI minus 1 hour 30.
That's correct. Configure for jettison.
Okay.
Under that, verify CM free.
Verify CM free.
Okay. Next, the COMM configuration. S-BAND, PM, PRIM.
Hold on. Say again now.
Okay. Next, COMM configuration.
This is for the command module?
Negative. The step above for CM free was command module, but the COMM is for LM again.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. S-BAND, PM, PRIMARY, PRIMARY again, OFF, PCM, RANGE, OFF, and HI.
Okay. Our S-BAND CONFIG is: PM, PRIM, PRIM, OFF, PCM, RANGE, OFF, HI.
That's correct. Stand by 1.
Do you have any druthers about which OMNI?
Yes. Select best OMNI.
Select - Did you say AFT, or best?
Best. Best in the west.
Okay. I was wondering if that's still going to be best after it leaves - But, okay. Select best OMNI at the time.
That's affirm. Okay. We've covered COMM, Fred. Next, ECS.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Under ECS, FORWARD DUMP valve, close.
Okay. FORWARD DUMP valve, close.
SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF, AUTO.
SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF to AUTO.
CABIN GAS RETURN, EGRESS.
CABIN GAS RETURN, EGRESS.
SUIT GAS DIVERTER, EGRESS.
GAS DIVERTER, EGRESS.
SUIT ISOLATION valves, two of them, DISCONNECT.
Okay. ISO valves, two, to SUIT DISCONNECT.
Roger. PRESSURE REGs A and B, close.
REGs A and B to close.
CABIN REPRESS valve, close.
REPRESS VALVE, close.
SUIT FAN, OFF.
How many more steps, Vance?
Two after this, Fred-o.
Okay. Stand by.
Maybe you need a scroll, yet.
Yes.
I want to ask him why all these steps just to get rid of a LM that's going to burn up in a half hour. Seems ridiculous. God damn it. Too many guys - -
SUIT FAN, OFF.
- - got in the act.
Okay. The last one was SUIT FAN, OFF. Hey, Jim, Deke said he thought you were asleep.
Okay. All these steps woke me up.
Okay. We'll try to be quieter. Except I don't know how. Okay, Fred-o - -
I got my audio breaker on.
Did you get SUIT FAN, OFF?
Yes. SUIT FAN, OFF.
Okay. Circuit breakers, panel - circuit breaker panel 16 rather. ECS, CABIN REPRESS to open.
Okay. CB panel 16, ECS, CABIN REPRESS, open.
Roger. OVERHEAD DUMP VALVE, closed. Maybe Jim has a point there, though.
Yes. OVERHEAD DUMP VALVE close, and it is already.
Right. Okay. That's all for the ECS. Next, ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, to MODE CONTROL.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Oh, stand by 1, Fred. We'd like to - change the position of that ATTITUDE CONTROL, three, MODE CONTROL to be just under CM free. That's a more convenient time.
Yes, I agree. Okay. Under, it'll be my item B, after verify CM free, it's ATT CONTROL, three, to MODE CONTROL.
And, along with that, DEADBAND, MAX.
Okay. Three to MODE CONTROL, comma, DEADBAND to MAX.
Next verify - -
If I don't sound too clear, it's because I'm holding a flashlight between my teeth.
Roger.
Okay.
Okay. Now - -
Okay. I think I'm - I'm up with you. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. Now again down at the bottom beneath ECS, verify transfer list.
Okay. Verify transfer list.
IVT to CM, and close hatch.
What was that - What was the first part of that?
Transfer yourself to the CM. Or rather, IVT, that's the commander to the CM, and close hatch.
Okay.
Actually, it's commander transfer to CM and you mean close hatches. Plural, right?
That's correct. Yes.
Okay.
Okay. That's all for the time line, Fred. Now the contingency checklist, if it's handy.
Okay. Which page?
Turn to 30-minute activation on page 24.
Okay. I'm there.
Okay. Now, at this point, you have this section marked up already, so what I give you now represents additional DELTAs to your previously marked up checklist.
Okay. That's all right. I've got a different color pen, so it'll show up nicely. Go ahead.
Okay. Okay. Go down to item 4.
Roger.
Verify ACS STATUS switch, OFF. That's an addition.
Do you mean, under IVT to the LM, number 4, RCS SYSTEM A/B-2, QUADs 4, AUTO? That 4?
That's affirm. Yes. It's the - the only 4 on that page 24 and it's a - presently has after it RCS SYSTEM A/B-2, QUADs, 4, to AUTO. Under that put - -
Roger.
- - put verify AGS STATUS switch to OFF.
Okay. Verify AGS STATUS switch OFF.
Okay. At the bottom of the page - Okay. You already have that. MODE CONTROL, both, OFF.
Okay. Next, page 26, circuit breakers.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. First row is okay as is. Second row, under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, GASTA should be closed.
Okay.
Under AC BUS A, close GASTA.
Okay. GASTA FLIGHT DISPLAYS and AC BUS A will be closed.
Roger. That's all on the second line. Now the third line, under STABILITY and CONTROL, ATCA (PGNS) to closed.
Okay. ATCA (PGNS) to close.
That's all on that line. Fourth line, near the right side, LGC STANDBY to close. And - -
Wait a minute. You mean LGC/DSKY.
LGC/DSKY. I'm sorry.
Okay.
And IMU OPERATE, close.
Okay. IMU OPERATE, close.
Okay, Vance. IMU OPERATE, close.
That's correct. Okay. Fourth row is okay as is. Now we would like to add - add in a late arrival to row two. Under - -
Go ahead.
Under FLIGHT DISPLAYS, MISSION TIMER, closed.
Okay. FLIGHT DISPLAYS, MISSION TIMER, closed. We can look at the ghosties right to the end.
Yes, that's right. Okay. That's all for that page, Fred. That should add up to six circuit breakers all closed, on that page.
Vance, Jim.
Go ahead, Jim.
Have we looked seriously now at just the essential things required to make a safe LM jettison? We're not - I don't think we have the time to really do any engineering data that people might want to look at as this thing goes into the atmosphere.
Well, Jim. I - I think that that was what everybody aimed for, and people down here feel that it's the essentials, that it's what you need.
Well, we'll do everything you think is essential, but I just don't want to be throwing switches at the last minute. What we're really thinking about, getting that command module in good shape.
Hey, Jim. This is Tom. The only reason we're bringing up the PGNS is to have another reference system just to control the LM when you jettison the thing. Over.
Okay. Okay, Tom. It's - I thought the - an AGS ATT HOLD would have been sufficient for this, when we first thought about this.
Yes. I agree. But we decided just in case we have any glitch with the AGS, we want to make sure we get that LM off in a good shape. And I agree with you on keeping out all the garbage on it.
Okay, Tom.
Hey, would you like to have - -
Good night.
Would you like to have us play you some guitar music to put you to sleep?
(Laughter) Oh, you know how to get to a guy.
We'll even have a 12-string guitar for you, Jimbo.
Okay.
Okay, Fred. Page 28.
Okay. I'm looking at panel 16 now.
No - No changes to panel - -
...
No changes to panel 16.
Okay. I'm on 28 now.
Right. Okay. At the top of the page, under step 4, just above "VHF/S-band activation," put in, "Delete POWER AMP and LGC." These are caution lights.
Okay. You mean delete PREAMP.
I'm sorry. PREAMP and LGC.
Okay.
Okay. Under "VHF/S-band activation and checkout," step 2, we have changes to the COMM as fellows.
Go ahead.
Okay. Scratch - Scratch out the DOWN and DOWN VOICE. That leaves - That'll give you VOICE.
Okay. That's the way we had it last time.
Okay. And, we'd like to insert RANGING.
Okay. Instead of OFF/RESET put RANGING.
That's correct.
Okay.
Okay. Under "PGNS turn-on," add in steps 1 and 2 again, which are NO ATTITUDE light off, VERB 96 ENTER, and set EVENT TIMER.
Okay. Steps 1 and 2 back in.
That's affirm. And underneath "Set EVENT TIMER," add the following: VERB 25 NOUN 07, ENTER; 1257, ENTER.
Okay. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay. If you got the 1257, ENTER, then 252, ENTER and ENTER.
Okay. After event, set EVENT TIMER, it's VERB 25 NOUN 07, ENTER; 1257, ENTER; 252 ENTER; ENTER.
Roger. And this activates your upfiring jets.
Say the last again, Vance.
Roger. What this does, Fred, is activate upfiring jets.
Oh, okay.
They're all - actually, all vertical jets.
Okay. I got it.
Okay. Next, same page, under "DAP set gimbal drive," go to step 2. Okay. Add in after NOUN 46, 32021.
Okay. 32021.
Okay. Proceeding on down below the NOUN 47, to the PROCEED, insert VERB 34, ENTER, after the PROCEED. And that would come before the NOUN 48.
Okay. To PRO and then do a VERB 34.
Roger. Okay. We have some noise here, Fred. Stand by a minute.
I switched OMNIs. How's that?
Hey, that helped. Okay. No changes now on 29, 30, and 31. Next page is 32.
Okay. I'm on 32.
Okay. At the very first step above "GUIDANCE CONTROL, AGS," put in VERB 76, ENTER.
Okay. VERB 76, ENTER.
Okay. Below "GUIDANCE CONTROL, AGS," the third step should be changed to be MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.
Okay. You want MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.
That's affirm.
Okay.
Okay. At minus 6 - 6 hours - or 6 minutes rather, under MODE CONTROL, PGNS, ATT HOLD, which was scratched out, insert VERB 41 NOUN 20, ENTER, and three more ENTERs. So - So it's as shown in your procedure there.
Yes.
Okay - -
Coarse aline 000.
Below that, put in DEDA, 400 plus 5.
Okay. DEDA, 400 plus 5.
Okay. Okay. We want back in again the next step which is "At burn attitude: VERB 40 NOUN 20, ENTER."
Okay.
Okay. Proceeding on down, delete "At burn attitude" and the step above it, which is 400 plus 5.
400 plus 5 and the "at burn attitude."
Correct.
Okay. That's all for page 32, Fred. Next, page 33.
Go ahead.
Okay. Under 4 minutes, minus 4 minutes, add back in MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.
Okay. MODE CONTROL, both, to ATT HOLD.
Okay. Two steps below that, add back in TTCA COMMANDER THROTTLE MIN DPS, and add in DPS.
Wait a minute.
Stand by 1.
TTC - Yes. Seems like you should be in JETS, since this is going to be - is this going to be RCS or a DPS burn?
Okay. This will be JETS for RCS and THROTTLE for DPS.
What I don't understand is, what is this MCC likely to be? I thought it was going to be an RCS.
Well, we - We expect that, but we're remaining flexible.
(Laughter) Okay. Okay. I'll put in TTCA THROTTLE MIN for DPS, JETS for RCS.
That's correct. Okay. That's all on page 33. Go to page 34.
Okay. Beneath everything on that page, add in the following. Return to "Entry, - LM PREP" check - return to "Entry, LM PREP" checklist - -
Hold on, Vance; I don't understand. We want to delete everything on page 34?
No, that's not correct, Fred. What we wait to do is leave everything the way it is on 34, and add this one comment I'm giving you at the - at the bottom of it.
Oh, okay. Okay. I misunderstood. Okay. Go ahead with your added comment.
Return to "Entry LM PREP checklist."
Add "EI" - -
... turn to - return to "Entry, LM checklist?"
That's affirm. At EI minus 5 hours.
Okay. At EI minus 5 hours. Let me take a look and see how that flows, now.
Okay. And also you have a - -
Okay. That would be the LM - the LM preentry procedure. Yes. Okay.
That's correct, and, also on that page, you - from our last correct - or addition exercise, you have a section called "Reestablish PTC." We'd like to scratch all of that, of course.
Roger.
Okay, Fred. That's all except for one comment that we have, and - just a second.
Stand by 1. Fred, we're polling the room for comments here, any last minute thoughts from people. We'll be right back with you.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Okay, Go ahead.
Okay, Fred. Just two changes, comments to what we just gave you. The first is near the front at EI - in the section under "EI minus 2-1/2 hours," power removal from CM LM umbilical." We'll let you turn to that.
Okay, I'm there at "EI minus 2-1/2 hours, power removal CM LM umbilical."
Okay. Under LM, we have a step, BAT 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET, than ON. Next we have a step BAT 2, HI VOLTAGE. OFF/RESET, then ON. We request that you wait in between these two steps for us to give you a GO. In other words, we'd like to look and see that all the relays closed and all that sort of thing before you throw BAT 2, HI VOLTAGE, to OFF/RESET, and ON.
Okay, After BAT 2, LOW VOLTAGE, OFF/RESET, I'll - then ON, I'll wait for a MSFN GO before proceeding.
Right-o. Okay. Next, at - Under the section of "EI minus 1 hour and 45 minutes" - No, change that. Correction, "EI minus 1 hour, 35 minutes," refer to the ECS section, and we have a change.
All right. Go ahead, Vance.
Okay, Jim's right. We should cross out all this stuff with a couple of exceptions. FORWARD DUMP valve, closed, the first step, should remain. All other steps should be scratched, except for the last one, which is OVERHEAD DUMP valve, closed. That leaves two steps.
Okay. Under ECS, we delete all except the first step, FORWARD DUMP valve, close, and step 10, which is OVERHEAD DUMP valve, closed, and leave in verify transfer list.
That's affirm. Leave in what follows, which is verify transfer list and IVT and all that.
IVT, of course, meaning CDR transferring to the CM.
We wouldn't forget it.
Okay, Fred-o. That's - That's the changes. Not quite as extensive as the CSM had, but still pretty long. Any comments or questions to the house here?
No, it looks pretty good to me, Vance.
Okay. Very good. Only other comment, aside from the checklist, we've been watching your descent stage water, and it looks - or your ascent stage water, and it looks real good.
Okay.
Okay, Fred. We're going to try to refrain from calling you from now on, so that you can maybe get a couple of winks. We're getting a status around the room first, to see if anybody has any comments for you and, after that, we'll try to leave you alone for awhile.
Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston.
Aquarius, Houston.
Hey, Fred-o. Are you there?
All right, go ahead.
Okay. We polled the room. We don't have much for you. Only comments as follows: your consumables are looking good; your entry gamma right now is minus 6.01. We're expecting a midcourse of 2.81 foot per second which should be about 21 seconds of RCS.
Okay. It sounds good.
Okay, Fred. See you in the morning.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. Request you open the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker and DOWN VOICE BACKUP, please.
Complete.
Roger.
Fred, are you sleeping?
Go ahead.
Fred, in a couple of minutes we're going to hand over the Honeysuckle, so there'll be - Our uplink will be terminated. We'll contact you when we get it back.
Okay.
After that, I've got a couple minutes of work for you.
All right. Go ahead.
Let's wait until after the handover.
Are you there, Jack?
Yes, I'm hearing you loud and clear. How me, Fred?
...
Okay. We want to get some ranging data on you for about 15 minutes. So close the POWER AMPLIFIER circuit breaker and go to NORMAL VOICE, please.
Okay.
Okay. You ought to have it now, Jack.
Okay. You're coming through good now, Fred. I've got three DELTAs to the checklist. They're minor changes. I'd like to pass them along now. One of them is to the CSM checklist. So if you'll pick that up, I'll give it to you.
Okay. Which one?
Okay. Stand by 1.
Is it the one Jack wrote them all in? The big long readout? He also wrote something in the G&N book.
It's in the big, long one he wrote out at about EI minus 02:30. EMS entry check.
Okay. He's coming back down with it.
Meanwhile, Fred, I've got two for you on the LM PREP checklist.
Okay. Jack's here now. I'll hand it to him.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
Hello, Aquarius. I've got a couple of changes for you on your CSM checklist.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. The time line between EI minus 02:30 and 1 hour is real crowded, so you're really going to have to hustle, and we've decided to delete the EMS entry check at minus 02:30. That'll give you a little more time in there. What we've decided to do with it is wait until after EI minus 1, just before you initialize the EMS. If you have time, and only if you have time, do the EMS entry check. Otherwise, forget it and go right on into EMS initialization. You understand?
Okay. You're going to delete between 2 hours and 30 minutes and 02:15 there, and you're going to add it, if there is time, only if there is time, at EI minus 1 hour where the EMS initialization occurs .
That's right. You got it correctly. Okay, Jack. One other item. Just before EI minus 2 hours and 15 minutes, we need an E-memory dump VERB 74 ENTER. Over.
Okay. Stand by 1, would you, please?
Okay. Right before 2 hours and 15 minutes, I assume that's before MSFN gives their P27 update, I do a VERB 74. Right?
That's affirmative, Jack.
How much sleep did you get, Jack?
Oh, I guess - Stand by. I guess maybe 2 or 3 hours. It was awful cold, and it wasn't very good sleep.
Roger. You plan to try to get any more?
What GET do you have?
We got 132:37.
Well, if I - If I get everything done, I'll try, but I tell you, it's almost impossible to sleep. All of us have that same problem. It's just too cold to sleep.
Roger. The way we're looking at it, looks like you ought to have a couple 3 hours here before you have to really get with it.
We'll - we'll take it easy, but I - and we'll try to sleep, but it's just awful cold.
Present data indicates that your entry angle is minus 6.03 degrees. Your DELTA-V at the midcourse is going to 2.8 feet a second.
Okay. Copy.
Jack, this is Jim. I understand this is going to be an RCS burn.
That's affirmative, Jim. It's going to be an RCS burn.
Okay.
And we need the SUIT CIRCUIT RELIEF valve back to AUTO. Correction, back to CLOSE.
Hey, Jack, that's in work. And one thing, comparing Jim's checklist with my own, I find one difference there at EI minus 02:30. His checklist has me changing a - opening a EPS SENSOR SIGNAL circuit breaker right prior to turning off LM power. Is - I'd like to find out which checklist is correct.
Hey, Jack. The LM checklist is just for information to Jim. It's just to tell him that - that you're changing back to command module power. Your checklist is correct. Over.
Okay. And when do you figure that you'll be sending up the pads that you have?
Aquarius, all of your pads will be coming up in about 3-1/2 hours, at EI minus 06:30. And one thing we want to remind you of, when you remove power from the command module LM umbilical, is to be sure that you open the LM POWER MAIN B circuit breakers, both of them, before you start throwing switches and circuit breakers in the LM. Do it as we've outlined it in the procedure, in that order. Over.
Okay. That's the way we planned on it. We'll let Jack do his three and then he'll tell us when we're GO from there. What pages are those changes on?
Okay, Fred. The one I've got for you is at the end of power removal from the command module LM umbilical. And just for your information, after you go through that entire procedure and about the time you're ready to transfer to the command module, at that time, power will be removed from the umbilical, and it's okay to disconnect it. That is, after you've thrown the switches in the LM. Is that clear?
Roger. That's where I've got a remark here to check with you to see if it's all right to proceed.
Roger. And that would be just after, on panel 16, you opening ASCENT ECA CONTROL breakers.
Which step number is that?
The confusing thing is, Jack, where they told me to wait for MSFN GO before proceeding was that BAT 2 LOW VOLTS OFF/RESET, then ON.
Okay. That's still affirmative. We'll give you a go after waiting 5 seconds, and then down from there just a few steps, after you have opened the ASCENT ECA CONTROL breakers on panel 16, at that point, the umbilical is not powered, and it's okay to disconnect them should you care to do so.
Okay. After the last step then, I'm free to disconnect.
Right. And one other change we have is, shortly after that, where we're configuring for jettison, we have closed both the FORWARD DUMP valve and the OVERHEAD DUMP valve. And we don't want to get in a locked up position like that, so one way to get around it is to - After we close the FORWARD DUMP valve, turn the DESCENT OXYGEN valve off. Over.
Okay. After the FORWARD DUMP valve, add a step in that says the DESCENT OX valve, off.
Okay, Fred. That concludes the DELTAs. And perhaps you heard that our GAMMAs are still minus 6.03 and our DELTA-V will be a 2.8-foot-per-second RCS burn.
Roger.
Fred-o, we've got one more change we'd like to give you to clarify a question that Jack asked earlier. At EI minus 02:30 - -
Okay. Hold on a minute, Jack. I meant to call Jack back down. I'm not familiar with the previous discussion.
Negative. This is on your checklist.
Okay. Go ahead.
At E mi - EI minus 02:30, during power removal from the umbilical, first thing we do is two steps with the CSM. We open the MAIN B, the LM POWER to MAIN B circuit breakers, and then there's a third step which says "Circuit breaker EPS SENSOR SIGNAL, MAIN B, open." Just delete that step. Over.
Okay. Delete the third step.
And, Aquarius, for your information, as far as our water supply is concerned, including our plans for powerup, we have an additional 18 hours of water remaining from this point.
Okay. Eighteen hours of water remaining from this point, Jack.
Hello, Houston; Aquarius.
Hello, Aquarius. Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. This is Jim. I just want to make sure that you're filtering the changes to the checklist that come up to make sure that they're absolutely essential. When we learn our procedures, we can only do it one time, and we can't make changes at the last minute. We'd like to do the best, the safest way possible, but unless the changes are really essential, don't bother sending them up.
Roger. We won't. The chairman of the CPCB is still active, and one thing we're trying to do is to save you all the time we can between EI minus 02:30 and 1 hour.
That's affirm. That's a real important time.
Yes. For your information, Jim, I don't know whether you heard that originally, but that time from 2-1/2 to 1 in there has been run about three times, and it's pretty tight, so we've tried to weed out what we could, which isn't much, but I think the other message you might impress on Jack when you get around to alining that platform, don't try to get it down too neat. It doesn't have to be all that good. Just do a nice quick and dirty one, and that's going to be good enough anyway.
I concur. I think for reentry we don't have to have a real accurate platform, but I haven't told Jack that.
Roger. Hey, Jim, while you're up and things are nice and quiet, let me give you a couple of other things to think about. One specifically. I know none of you are sleeping worth a damn because it's so cold, and you might want to dig out the medical kit there around 01:35 or in that ballpark, and pull out a couple of Dexedrines apiece and try one about then, and another around 01:39 to 01:40.
Well, I hadn't brought that up. We might - We might consider it.
Okay.
Wish we could figure a way to get a hot cup of coffee up to you. It'd probably taste pretty good about now, wouldn't it?
Yes, it sure would. You don't realize how cold this thing becomes when it's in a PTC mode that's slowing down, and I just clocked the cycles on my ... And it's about 11 to 12 minutes now, and the Sun is directly overhead, so it's shining on the engine bell of the service module and not getting down to the spacecraft at all.
Hang in there. It won't be long now.
Yes. That's right. As a matter of fact, doing this alinement on the Earth this time will be like making a landing with a fogged-up windshield.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Skipper. We figured out a way for you to keep warm. We decided to start powering you up now, and what we want you to do - what we want you to do is take your entry LM PREP checklist and start at the top where it says "BAT 5 NORMAL FEED on," and then jump over as it says to your 30-minute activation, and do all of the 30-minute activation up to, but not including, the burn. You copy?
Okay. If I understand you correctly, then that gives me leeway to maneuver when we get up to activation complete, and we can be in position for the burn, but we will not burn. We don't have a pad anyway.
That's affirm, Jim. You could maneuver to burn attitude, or you could maneuver to an attitude which should put the Sun in the windows to warm the place up.
Sounds good, and you're sure we have plenty of electrical power to do this?
That's affirmative. We've got plenty of power to do it. I can get you a number, though.
Jim, you've got about 100-percent margins on everything from here on in.
That sounds encouraging.
Roger. That's in the LM. We're not talking about the CSM right now.
I understand.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. Question. This short turnon step 3 on page 24 has us only turning on the RCS SYSTEM A/B, two quads, and the breakers are still out on panel 11. Did you want those in, too, or are we just going to use one set of heaters?
Stand by.
Aquarius, Houston. Go as the checklist recommends for now. When you get into the circuit breaker panel configuration, you're going to get the number 1 set of heaters on anyway.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We'd like to get a hack to set our mission timer here, Jack.
Okay, Fred-o. Set it at 133:35 straight up. You've got about 30 seconds to set it.
Okay. Standing by.
Okay. I'll give you the 2-second delay in there. Stand by to start.
START.
Okay. We've got it.
Okay. I'm counting 133:35:10.
Right on.
Aquarius, Houston. One other way to warm things up in a hurry in there is when you get your AC on to turn on the window heaters.
Okay. I guess the only question I have is what it's liable to do to us with the - looks like almost a frost on it now.
Understand this, Jack. I'd like to let it maybe warm up just a little bit more before hitting it with the heat load.
Not a bad idea.
And, as you can see, Houston, at turnon we got our old friend downlink 2 back.
Roger. We're seeing it, Fred.
Aquarius, Houston. It looks like you're proceeding toward the gimbal lock there. We'd like you to check that, please.
Roger. Not much we can do about it. We can't use the thrusters, Houston.
Okay. Forget it now; we'll get it later.
And, Houston, Aquarius. I guess the next thing for the PGNS will be a coarse aline 000, but I guess we ought to hold up now until we get enough time on the RCS thrusters.
Roger. We're looking at them. We'll give you the GO on them. Okay, Aquarius. Your quads are 120 to 133 now, so you're cleared for - Cleared for thrusters.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Did you get my GO for RCS?
That's affirm. We're GO. What we're doing now, Jack, is letting the spacecraft drift in this mode to pick up the Earth again.
Okay.
I don't want to just go blasting around the sky and get high rates, because I don't have anything to null the rates on until the Earth comes back up again. And - Once I get the Earth in sight, we have no strain on nulling rates. That part of the Earth, that is.
It's going to be interesting today, Jack. The Earth's a lot bigger; the crescent is a lot more pronounced than it was yesterday.
Well, you're going in the right direction.
That's right.
And, Jack, I guess we haven't changed our angle much with respect to the Sun 93 million miles away, so it ought to be in about the same place in the AOT, isn't that Charlie?
Hold 1 on that, Fred. I'll get an answer for you.
Okay.
Aquarius, your ASA is warmed up now. You can activate the AGS.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. When you look out a detent 2 in the proper burn attitude, what you ought to see is the Sun at 12 o'clock, about halfway between the top of the AOT and the center of the pipper. And you ought to see the Earth - -
Okay.
- - at 6 o'clock.
Okay.
And, it's getting a little warmer in here now. Thank you.
Duck blinds are always warmer, Jim, when the birds are flying.
Right.
Jack, I've gotten so used to flying attitude with the TTCA, I won't be able to do it normally.
Say again, Jim.
I said I've gotten so used to flying attitude with the translational control, I won't be able to do with the ACA.
Aquarius, we see your glycol temperature getting up there. If you want to make it a little warmer, or you can try putting your SUIT TEMP valve to HIGH, if you haven't already got it there.
Okay.
Aquarius, something we're thinking about right now is, if we can do it without using a lot of RCS, it would be to our advantage timewise to try to get an alinement.
Okay. You mean a P52?
We're - -
I'll ... around.
A combination of 51 and 52.
I'll see what we can do, Jack.
Okay. And we'd planned to use the Moon and the Sun for that.
Aquarius, Houston. On panel 16, we'd like for you to close the CROSS TIE BAL LOADS breaker, please.
Okay. It's closed.
And it looks like we could support a - an alinement in a few minutes, if you'd be willing to go ahead with that.
Jack, it sounds good. I think from our position here, we know where the Sun and Moon are and it's strictly going to be a pitch maneuver. But I think we can save some gas. I'll see what we can do.
Roger.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
We're all set to go. Are you going to ship us up a REFSMMAT?
Yes, we are. Stand by 1.
Okay.
The Sun feels wonderful. It's shining in the rendezvous window.
And, Aquarius, before we can ship you a load, we'll have to have, on panel 11, under COMM, the UPDATA LINK circuit breaker closed.
It's closed.
Roger. It'll be a few - -
... closed ... -
Okay. And it'll be a few minutes yet, Jim. We're still cranking it up.
Okay. Stay with it, Jack, and I'll go back to data.
Roger.
I got BAT in about 33-1/3 percent on that uplink. Too fast alarm.
Say again on that, Fred.
I just got another uplink too fast when I took the DATA switch back off - It's happening, I guess, about a third of the time.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. We're ready with your load if you'll give us DATA please.
Going to DATA. You got it.
Aquarius, Houston. After the uplink, you'll have to set the drift and the REFSMMAT flag as on page 8 of the contingency book, steps 5 and 6.
Page 8, steps 5 and 6. Roger.
Okay. Are you done with the computer now, Jack?
Negative. We'll give you the word.
Roger. Aquarius, we're through with it, it's your computer.
Thank you.
And, Aquarius, Houston; take option 1 on a P52 when you get to it. And I've got some ball angles for a Sun and Moon.
Okay. We want an option 1 and you've got some ball angles for Sun and Moon. And right now, Jim has the Sun pretty well squared away right in the middle of AOT.
And have you got some plan in vectors for us, Jack?
Okay, Fred-o. For the Sun, I've got 246; for the Moon I've got 250.
Are you talking about ball theta angles?
Negative. I was - I was reporting the code for NOUN 70.
They're in the computer, Fred.
Oh, okay.
Okay, Houston. We have the Sun marks and I'll start up at pitch now to go over and pick up the Moon.
Roger.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead.
Just as a note of interest in this dock configurations for P52s, the command module docking probe is right down the middle of - the docking light, rather, is right down the middle of the detent. And when the Sun flashes on, it really makes it difficult.
Roger.
Just like the simulator.
Yes. It was good training.
Well, Jack, that's what it says the torquing angles are.
We haven't got them yet.
Aquarius, hold on to torquing angles, please.
We're doing that.
Jim, the reason for the delay is that we're not seeing the data yet. We're having to check a point here; and as soon as they come up, we'll let you know what to do with them.
Okay. We had a large NOUN 105 of - what - 112, and our torquing angles, Jack, are minus 01713, minus 03278, minus 01395.
Roger. Minus 01713, and we see them now.
Aquarius, torque them.
Okay.
At 35:04:25.
Aquarius, do you have a star close by there you could check?
I'll look around, Jack. I was just trying to get a check on the Moon, again, to see if those angles were indeed true, and we got the Moon back again and centered.
Roger.
Okay, Jack. What you're reading now the angles? We had the Moon centered, and it's pretty close to what we have on the 8 ball, I guess. Close enough for any entry that we'd like to do.
Roger. And I'm told that Denubla - Denebola and Regulus are nearby if you wanted to make a star check.
Okay. I'm going to start pitching around again, and I'll see if I can pick them up. I have Orion out here to my left a little bit, but it's pretty close to the - oh, here. I've got Sirius. That's a nice one. How about that?
Sounds good here.
Aquarius, is Jack sitting on the rumble seat there?
He was. He just headed upstairs to take another look around.
Okay. I got a minor addition to the entry checklist for him. This time it's in the - -
Okay. Stand - -
- - entry book.
Okay. Stand by 1. He has that in his pocket.
What I'm doing, Jack, is just - I'm pitching over now. I'm going to pick up another star. Sirius was just too far off. I thought I was going to use too much gas getting there.
Roger.
By the time I get alined in the - in the AOT - be nice if we didn't have Odyssey attached, we could just AUTO - AUTO maneuver over to these things.
Looks to us like you've got her alined, Jim, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.
Yes. I'm pretty confident that the platform's fairly decent.
Aquarius, Houston. We need an E MOD VERB 74, when you've got a chance, please.
Okay. Coming to you.
Okay, Jack. On your entry checklist, on page 2-5. Down there on step 9, where it says 152 degrees pitch at .05g, adjacent to that, so that Recovery can see you better on the way down, we want you to turn your S-BAND, POWER AMPLIFIER to HIGH. Over.
Okay. Turn S-BAND, POWER AMP to HIGH at .05g time.
That's affirmative.
Okay. Is that it?
That's it, Jack.
Aquarius, Houston. We're considering doing the midcourse with PGNS, unless you'd rather do it in AGS.
No. PGNS is fine with me. I just aline myself up with the old ball again. So I've got you foresighted again, but any way you want to do it.
Like you say, you might as well go first class.
I guess you're right.
Now wait a minute, Jack.
I just lost a lot of friends there.
And, Jack, you can tell Owen Morris that the RCS SYSTEM A/B 2 QUAD 1 breaker is still nicely in.
Roger. We'll pass the word.
Aquarius, Houston. We think we've figured out a way to save you some time at a very critical - very full schedule. And that's by doing a docked coarse aline, since we got the LM up now. That would save you a maneuver or two.
Houston, Aquarius. It seemed to me a docked coarse aline might be quicker for - for Jack.
Yes. We think it would be, and it'd save quite a bit of time at a place where you're going to be pretty busy. Also save you some petrol.
Affirm.
Okay, Jim. We're looking at doing this in the service module SEP attitude, and the optics will be pointed away from the Sun. So it should be a good attitude for a P52.
Okay. So, we'll be going to the service module SEP attitude, at which time we'll do a docked coarse aline, and -
Then you want - You want Jack then to do a P527
The way we'll do that in our time line Jim, is to go ahead and do the service module JETT and then we'll just stay in that attitude and when it comes time in our time line as we've outlined, to bring the platform up, we'll proceed with the P52 - coarse aline, and then the P52.
Okay. Are we going to use the same techniques that we normally do for LM activation? In other words, I try to maintain an attitude, and give him some angles and then - Are you going to give him the angles? Then he does the 52.
Basically, it's the same procedure just reversed, Jim.
Okay.
Another nice thing about this, is it's one we've done before.
And, Aquarius. One thing, however, that we do not plan to do is to proceed with the command module powerup prematurely.
Roger.
Understand.
Okay, Houston. This is Jack.
Go ahead, Jack.
Okay. I just wanted to talk over with you, it looks like we've had some changes in the flight plan here, due to Jim's P52. Do you have - Can you talk over with me what your plans are?
Roger, Jack. Since we've got the PGNS up, we plan to use that information to give the CMC a dock coarse aline, and then we're in the service module jettison attitude, we'll wait until it comes time to power up the CMC, and we'll get the CMC a dock coarse aline, and we'll pick some good stars to give you a fine aline with, and it looks like we can pick some stars that are looking away from the Sun in which you can find in that service module jettison attitude; so, we'll save you quite a bit of gas: and save you some time in a very busy time.
Hey, that sounds good. Really fine.
Keeping warm?
Hey, it's warmed up here now. It's almost comfortable.
I'm looking out the window now, Jack, and that Earth is whistling in like a high-speed freight train.
We're clocking you at 48 000 miles and coming in at about 9000.
I don't think there's many LMs that have seen it like this. I'm still looking for Fra Mauro and Cone Crater.
You're going the wrong way, son.
Okay, Jack. It looks - just looking over what I may expect here, it looks like I'm just going to get three angles to do a VERB 41 NOUN 20, right?
That's what it looks like from here, Jack. It's pretty much the opposite of the LM activation procedure where we do the dock coarse aline.
Yes, except in a way we did a lot of VERB 06 NOUN 20, ENTERS, simultaneously, and then you all shipped him up post-torque values. You're not going to do anything like that are you?
Say again, please, Jack.
Okay. During the activation part, we do a lot of VERB 06 NOUN 20, ENTERS simultaneously, reading you out the difference in the angles, and then MSFN furnishes the post-torquing angles, in order to get the platform fine alined. Do you plan something like that or just three coarse aline angles.
Jack, we're going to give you three coarse aline angles, and then you can go right to your checklist as we're giving it, and start in with the VERB 40 NOUN 20.
Okay. Real fine.
And, Jack, how do you read?
Fine - square.
I was around shooting pictures of all the debris inside here, before we left, and I inadvertently changed the settings on the DC command module Reseau camera that we need for the service module pictures. I wonder if FAO can dig them out again - what we need, f-stop and speed.
Okay, Fred. Stand by.
Fred, in regards to the camera settings, for black-and-white 3400 film, the settings were f:5.6 at 1/250th. Over.
Okay. I'd guessed right after all, but thank you.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. I got MCC-7 pad when you're ready to copy. Over.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. We're in luck, I got one pad left.
Okay. We'll take care not to change this one. Ready to go?
Go ahead, Joe.
MCC-7: 137:39:48.39, minus 0003.1, plus all zeros, plus 00001, N/A, plus 0020.5, 0003.1, 0:23, 008, 359; the rest is N/A. Remarks: plus-X, four jets, RCS; and your weights for the DAP load: LM weight, 25181; CSM weight, 62468. Over.
Okay, Joe. MCC-7: 137:39:48.39, minus 0003.1, plus all balls, plus 0000.1, N/A, plus 0020.5, plus 0003.1, 0:23, 008 359; the rest of pad N/A. Remarks: plus-X, four jets, RCS, ullage; the LM weight, 25181; CSM weight, 62468. Over.
Okay. Readback correct.
And, Aquarius; Houston. I have a service module SEP pad if you want to copy that, now. Over.
Say again, Joe.
Roger, Fred. I have a service module SEP pad with the attitudes. You don't need a pad sheet for it; just any old blank sheet will do.
Okay. I was going to say I don't - We don't hardly carry a service module SEP pad.
Yes, we'll have to change that.
Okay. I'm using a P27 here. Go ahead.
Okay. The pad reads as follows and then I'll repeat the angles for you, so you can copy them. The following MCC-7, maneuver the LM to the following FDAI attitudes: roll, 000; pitch, 91.3; yaw, 000. Now do you want those attitudes repeated, Fred?
Okay. Following MCC-7 we're to maneuver to the following attitudes: roll, 000; pitch, 091.3; yaw, 000.
Okay. That's correct. And the last part of the pad is at GET 138:10:00, which is EI minus 4.5 hours, execute a push of 0.5 feet per second, four jet, plus-X; perform SM SEP; then execute pull, 0.5 feet per second, four jet, minus-X. Over.
Houston, Aquarius. Jack's entering the command module, now.
Okay, Jim.
Okay. That last Joe was execute at the GET at 138:10:00 which is EI minus 4-1/2 hours; execute a push of 0.5 feet per second, four-jet ullage; then execute SM SEP followed by a pull of 0.5 feet per second, with respect to a nomenclature on the TTCA; I think we really need an up of 0.5 and then a down of 0.5.
That's correct, Fred.
Okay, Aquarius. The last pad I had for you right now is the LM jettison pad. Similar to the - Stand by 1, Aquarius.
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. Request P00 and DATA for a data load. Over.
You got it.
Okay. And I was about to say the LM jettison pad is similar to the SM SEP pad, Fred, when you're ready to copy.
Just about the same number of lines?
Yes.
Okay. Go ahead, Joe.
Okay, Fred. Prior to 141:40:00, which is EI minus 1 hour, maneuver the LM to the following FDAI angles: roll, 130; pitch, 125; yaw, 012.4. The corresponding CSM gimbal angles will be roll, 291; pitch, 196; yaw, 045, and that's the pad. Over. And the computer is yours, Aquarius.
Thank you.
Okay. A LM SEP pad prior to 141:40:00, EI minus 1 hour, maneuver to following attitudes: roll, 130; pitch, 125; yaw, 012.4. The corresponding CSM gimbal angles are roll, 291; pitch, 196; yaw, 045.
Readback correct.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. We're so efficient down here that we got an entry pad ready, Fred. Do you want to copy that for Jack? Over.
Stand by. I'll have to try to borrow his book from him.
Roger.
Can we hold off on that a little bit, Joe?
Oh, absolutely, Jim. We're well ahead. I just wanted to let you know that we had it.
Okay. I hope that when you send up all those uplinks to Jack that you could get them up to him quickly.
We're shooting for less than 5 minutes.
Sounds good.
And are you still using the computer?
That's a negative, Fred. The computer is yours.
And, Fred, the computer has your target load in.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. I just want to clarify one thing on the LM|LM SEP pad. It appears to me that in my configuration, I could probably use a VERB 49 loading in 622, yaw, pitch, and roll, in that order; and then being able to fly out at 5018 in roll, pitch, and yaw. Is that correct?
Stand by; I'll verify it, Jim.
Okay, Joe. And while you're doing that I've got a question about the command module checklist.
Okay, Jack. Go ahead with your question.
Okay. Either I copied the circuit breaker wrong, or - I can't read it. Comes down just about the - oh, about the 20th one down, after panel 276, where it says CB INSTRUMENTATION POWER CONTROL 3 and 4, open. The next circuit breaker on panel 5 - I - Would you give that to me again?
Roger. That's CB ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER, MAIN B. Over. And it's, closed.
Okay. I just can't, right - I just can't read my writing, ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER MAIN B, closed.
That's affirmative.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Roger. The word we have is that you can't make a VERB 49 maneuver to the LM|LM jettison attitude because those are FDAI|FDAI angles we gave you, they don't correspond to the gimbal angles for the load; it'll have to be a manual maneuver. Over.
Okay.
And mind out for gimbal lock.
We will.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We're looking at LM|LM current, to see if Jack has started his preheat, and we haven't seen it yet. Is he doing okay down there?
Houston, Jack said he's already started it, and he said that in 1 more minute, he'll be up to 20 minutes.
Oh. Roger that.
Jim, Houston. Have him let us know what his test meter reads when he's done.
He says that he had a battery A voltage drop of 2 volts, and he'll try to look at the test meter for you right now.
Okay.
He's been looking at them, but they haven't been coming up, so far.
We copy.
Do you see a current now, Houston?
Stand by 1 on that, Jim. That's affirmative, Jim; it looks like we are seeing one now.
Okay. And thanks for keeping us on it.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Reminder P41|P41 for the RCS|RCS burn.
Thanks for keeping us honest.
We got to protect our jobs, Jim.
We've been DPS-ing so long here.
Yes.
Okay, Houston. I finished up the maneuvers, the AUTO maneuver in 41, but only roll and yaw needles seem to be offset. Pitch is okay.
Okay, Jim. We copy. Stand by. Aquarius, Houston. We recommend PGNS|PGNS MODE CONTROL to ATT HOLD. Save a little gas and stand by on the error needles.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Did you call?
Roger, Joe. Figured, if we're going to do this burn in PGNS|PGNS now, I ought to give you an update on the contingency book pages 32, 33, and 34, because the last time we went through this portion, we were burning it in ACS.
Okay, Fred. Stand by. We've been talking about possibly having you do it in ACS. We recommend at this time that you do an ACS to PGNS|PGNS aline, the 400 plus 3 procedure only. Over.
Okay.
And, Aquarius, Houston
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We recommend that you perform this burn in AGS|AGS, as you did the last midcourse manuever; we think it will save gas. Over.
Okay. Joe, do you want me to line up the same way we did the last one, too?
Stand by on that.
And, Joe, Jack just handed me some injector temperatures, if you want to read these on ... so I can plug them in.
Roger. Go ahead with those.
Okay. 5 Charlie, 14.0; 5 Dogs, 3.7; 6 Able, 3.5; 6 Bravo, 4.1; 6 Charlie, 4.2; 6 Delta, 3.8.
Okay. Copy those, Fred.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. Our recommendation on this burn is that you maneuver to the burn attitude, in PGNS MIN IMPULSE, then do a body-axis aline, 400 plus 5, followed by 400 plus 0, and then do the burn in AGS. Over.
Okay. Now we're spinning it with the PGNS, what you gave us for a PGNS attitude. Is this the wrong one? Do you want me to just to aline up the Earth as I did before in the last midcourse?
No. We don't want you to do that. Read me your FDAI angles, and let's compare them with what we have down here.
Okay. You're looking at them in the DSKY. I've got roll of 8.47; pitch of about 0.51; and yaw looking at about 3.750.
Okay, Jim. Those are very close - I guess all you need to do is trim them up a bit.
I plan to do a final trim - AUTO trim, and then a four-jet translation.
Okay, Jim. For fuel conservation, we'd prefer you to trim it up MIN IMPULSE, and there's really very little trim required; and then go ahead and do it AGS. We're on the expected fuel usage, but we're just being old ladies about it.
Okay. Understand. My only question, Joe, is the fact that both the roll and the yaw needles did not go to null when I did an AUTO maneuver. I'd tried to go manually to the attitude; and then went to AUTO, but the roll and the yaw do not come in at all.
Roger. I haven't got an answer on that yet, but your attitude looks very close.
Okay. I can take it on ...
And, Houston, Aquarius. I'm not sure that if I follow and null the needles, that will be the proper attitude.
Okay. Stand by 1, Jim. We're talking about it. It's going to be very close; in any event, close enough.
Okay.
And, Jim, just for your information, I have the entry pad. I have the landing area weather summary, which you probably don't even have to copy, but which I'll read up to you when you're ready; and some stars for Jack that I'm holding for him for later on.
Okay.
And, Joe, Jack says all the injector temperatures, he just checked them again, and they're all over 3.9 - -
That they're all over 3.9 now. Thanks a lot.
You can tell him that it's looking good to us. They were even happy with the previous ones.
Okay.
And, my only question, Houston, is do you want me to null the PGNS needle manually?
Okay. Stand by 1 more minute, Jim.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Yes. I guess the basic question is comparing the balls here and out the window it doesn't look too unreasonable, and I guess Jim says the COAS is yawed and roll slightly off from what he might eyeball; but yet, the FDAI air needles for PGNS are showing a full scale left in roll and full scale left in yaw. ...
Okay. Go ahead.
Yes. It appears if we track those we, obviously, aren't going to be on the attitude that we burned the last midcourse.
Okay. Well, this attitude we passed you is not quite alined to the terminator, and stand by on this.
It should be off about 8 degrees, FLIGHT.
How you doing there, Houston?
Oh, we're getting there, Jim. We're - we're all agreed that you're almost, but not quite, in the proper attitude, and we're just trying to get you one firm recommendation on how to proceed from here.
Okay. I have nulled the null - roll needle and the pitch needle now and I'm yawed - rolled left now. I'm rolled left about 9 degrees.
Okay. Understand the needles are nulled.
The yaw isn't, but the pitch and roll are.
Roger that.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Here's the big story. Your attitude really looks quite good except in roll, and we'd like you to do the following. In MIN impulse PGNS, we'd like you to trim to zero pitch, which is about where you are now; to 008 degrees in roll, which is about 16 degrees from your present roll attitude; and to zero degrees in yaw, which is about where you are now. Then we'd like you to do the body-axis aline 400 plus 5, 400 plus 0. PITCH and ROLL to PULSE, select AGS, do the burn in AGS. How does that sound? Over.
Okay. I'm rolled the wrong way; that is what you're saying, right?
That's right.
And you know I can't roll in minimum impulse. I've got to use TTCA|TTCAs.
That's right, Jim. Sorry.
And you don't want me to automatically trim 5018, I take it.
That's affirm, Jim. Don't trim 5018.
Okay.
We just want you to cycle on through P41 to get the average g and burn it out.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Just for your information, we see 3.0 in register 1. We read you up 3.1 on the pad. The actual DELTA-V was 3.05, and they warned me that it might come out 3.0.
Okay. That's a little burn.
Right.
Aquarius, Houston. Your attitude looks real good. We will give you a mark at 10 minutes to the burn, which is in 28 seconds.
Okay. We'll burn it in AGS and use the AGS ball.
Right. I was looking at the wrong clock, and we're a little under 10 minutes now. I'll give you a mark at 9 minutes. Okay?
That's fine.
Aquarius, Houston. We have 10 seconds until 9 minutes to the burn. 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Nine minutes.
Very well. That agrees with our event timer.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. About 3 minutes to go, and we're all squared away.
And, Aquarius; Houston. Roger that. And we're standing by for your body-axis aline and your zeroing 404, 405, 406, going to 470.
Okay. You'd asked - you'd asked me before, Joe, to go 400 plus 3, which I did. I assume you've changed the script again.
Okay, Fred. We did tell you to do that awhile ago, and it doesn't matter; you're looking good.
Okay.
Yes. It looks like we had a minus 0.2 bias at 470. We're burning.
Copy that, Fred.
Good show, Aquarius.
We're tweaking now, Joe.
Roger. Aquarius, Houston. You're good right where you are.
Okay. That's it.
Okay. If you're happy, can we maneuver to service module SEP attitude now?
That's affirmative, Aquarius.
And I'm pitching up to the proper attitude.
Okay. We're looking at it.
And it's again necessary to use the TTCA to pitch.
Okay. Affirmative.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Recommend you terminate P41.
Okay.
Hey, Jim, have you broken into the medical kit per my recommendation a few hours ago?
Yes. Everything is taken care of Deke.
Okay, fine. You might hit it again in about 2 hours.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston. AFT OMNI.
I beat you to it, Houston.
Yes. I thought you did, but I thought I'd say it anyway.
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. That attitude looks pretty good. How's Jack getting along?
He's getting along, all set to go. And I'm going to go into PGNS ATT HOLD.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Again for fuel-consumption reasons, we'd like you to go back to the AGS mode you were in rather than PGNS ATT HOLD. Over.
Okay. I'm in PGNS MINIMUM IMPULSE right now while we're firing. And I'll go back to the AGS mode.
Okay, Jim. PGNS MIN IMPULSE is okay; AGS is okay too. It's your choice.
Soon as we get rid of the service module, Joe, I think I'll be able to maneuver a lot better.
Sure thing.
Okay, Jack just reported that all thrusters fired on both rings.
Real fine. Real fine.
And SM JETT at 138:12.
Roger. Understand; that's SM JETT, 138:12. It's not that time critical, Jim.
Can we do it at any time, Joe?
I think so, but let me check. Aquarius, Houston. That's affirmative. You can jettison the service module when you are ready; no big rush, but any time.
Okay. Sounds good.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We recommend that you use the AGS for the separation maneuver, because we'd like to get the proper weight in for the DAP before we use the PGNS again.
Roger. We will. Stand by.
SM SEP.
Copy that.
Do you see it, Jack?
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. I recommend you terminate AVERAGE G. Over.
Okay, I've got her, Houston.
Beautiful, beautiful. And for you information, Jim, you'll be coming up on an RCS caution light for helium. No sweat. Over.
And there's one whole side of that spacecraft missing.
Is that right?
Right by the - Look out there, will you? Right by the high gain antenna, the whole panel is blown out, almost from the base to the engine.
Copy that.
Yes, it looks like it got to the SPS bell, too, Houston.
Think it zinged the SPS engine bell, huh?
That's the way it looks; unless that's just a dark brown streak. It's really a mess.
Okay, Jim. We'd like you to get some pictures, but we want you to conserve RCS. Don't make unnecessary maneuvers.
And, Jim; Houston. In particular, of course, we don't want any translation maneuvers.
Right on that. Joe, you realize that when I went up to the SM SEP attitude, I had to use TTCA to do it.
That's affirm. We know that. That's okay.
All right. She's drifting right down in front of our windows now, Houston.
Okay.
Okay, Joe, I'm now looking down the SPS bell, and it looks - looks okay on the inside; maybe it is just a streak.
Okay. Copy that, Fred. Was the bell deformed on the outside or just nicked or what?
I think the explosion, from what I could see, Joe, had - had stained it. I don't know whether it did any actual deformation or not.
Okay.
Man, that's unbelievable!
And, Joe, looks like a lot of - a lot of debris is just hanging out the side near the S-band antenna.
Roger, Jim.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
I know you're busy, but when Jack gets a chance, we'd like BAT C current and MAIN A voltage in the command module.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. I've pitched up to about 180 degrees now, and do you want me to go to the LM SEP attitude for his alinement?
Stand by on that, Jim.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We want you to go to the service module SEP attitude.
Okay.
And, Jim, when you have leisure to copy, I have your NOUN 46 and NOUN 47 DAP data load numbers.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. NOUN 46, 31021; NOUN 47, plus 25248 and plus 09050. Over.
Roger; 31021, plus 25248, plus 09050.
That's correct.
And now, Houston, do you still think that AGS is going to be less expensive than PGNS mode?
That's affirmative, Jim.
Okay. I'm in AGS pulse right now. It's the ...
Okay. We concur.
Going back to LM SEP attitude - or CSM SEP attitude.
Roger that.
Aquarius, Houston.
Stand by. Jack's on the line and he says that he can't get the computer to go into standby.
Okay. Have him tell us what he's - what he looks at. And remind him that he won't see the light. He won't see the STANDBY light - -
Okay - -
- - because it's not powered- -
- - Joe - -
Go ahead, Jack.
Joe. Okay, I get a flashing 37, I am in PROGRAM 06. There is no STANDBY light, but when I ENTER, I don't get the three balls 62 displayed like I'm supposed to.
Okay, Jack - -
And this - -
Go ahead - -
- - and this occurs on both DSKYs.
Okay. Understand. We're - we're thinking about it. Stand by 1.
Okay, Jack; Houston. We'd like you to go VERB 37, ENTER; 06, ENTER again. Over.
Okay. In work.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. I'm back in the service module SEP attitude.
Okay. Copy that, Jim. Looks good. Do you know whether Jack got any pictures out of window 5? Was it still fogged up? Over.
I don't think so. I think he came right down here, because I think he saw it first in the - in the LM.
Okay. Good deal. And whenever you get cleaned up, we got the entry pad and the landing area summary for you.
Okay, Vance. This is Jack.
Go ahead.
Okay. Doing a VERB 37, ENTER; 06, ENTER does bring up the three balls 62 display, but I can't PROCEED on it on either DSKY and a VERB 33 doesn't work either.
Okay.
It's still just a flashing 5025 with a code 00062.
Okay. Copy that, Jack. Stand by 1.
Jack, Houston. How long did you hold PROCEED before you quit on it?
Well, it was varying lengths. Is it suppose to be a long-time PROCEED?
We think it may be, Jack. We think it may be 15 to 20 seconds, and our recommendation is that you PRO and hold it down for a good period of time, probably half a minute or more, and see if the DSKY blanks.
Okay. All right, I didn't hold it in that long. Maybe 2 or 3 seconds is the longest I held it.
Okay.
Okay, Jack just came down the tunnel again and said the computer's okay.
Okay. Good to hear it. And did you ever get that BAT C MAIN A reading for us?
I guess in the heat of the battle, I forgot to to give it to you, I guess. Stand by.
Okay.
BAT C current was 2 amps and BAT A voltage, 30.2.
Copy, 2 amps, 30.2. And that sounds good to us, Jim.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like to have Jack verify that the PYROs in LOGIC are SAFE, and we'd like to remind him to do no further powerup of the CSM until EI minus 2 plus 30.
Roger. He reports that the PYROs are SAFE, and we're standing by for 02:30.
Okay. Real good.
Well, I can't say that this week hasn't been filled with excitement.
Well, James, if you can't take any better care of a spacecraft than that, we might not give you another one. Hey, Jim; Houston. You might ask Jack, while he's down there, to take a peek through the telescope and tell us whether he can see any stars. Over.
Okay.
Joe, Jack tells me that there's still a lot of particles floating around and he's - he can't pick out any constellation that he recognizes so far. But it might clear here in a little while.
Okay, understand.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. EECOM is looking at that battery amperage that you gave us awhile ago. He'd like to see it about a half an amp to an amp lower. Like you to ask Jack to just check the circuit breakers and switches that he's pulled in so far and make sure he doesn't have any extra loads on MAIN A; specifically, the FLOODLIGHT configuration, and his CAUTION AND WARNING circuit breakers, and his ESSENTIAL INSTRUMENTATION POWER circuit breakers. Over.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay. Jack reported that he turned out all the floodlights.
Okay. Okay, we copy that. Like to have him check the amperage on there; see what you have now, and give us a voltage reading, too.
Okay, will do.
Okay, Joe. This is Jack.
Go ahead.
Okay. I've been not reading any voltage at all on BAT C, and the amperage looks like about 2 amps, but that could be kind of noise-level stuff. I've got all the floodlights off and I - Can you think of anything - I could power down to lower MAIN A.
Okay. How about reading the voltage off of MAIN A?
Okay. Oh, this is Ken. Okay. Ken, it was 30.2.
Okay. We're checking out the floodlights we gave you. Actually, Jack, you ought to be able to go ahead and use the lights we gave you. There's no reason to sit in the dark. They're supposed to be coming off of MAIN B, and we're checking that now.
Okay. It's not bad down there. We're in - got plenty of light. But should I be reading the voltage on BAT C?
Jack, you should be reading BAT C voltage. That circuit breaker should be open.
Okay. Okay, can you think of anything else you want to get turned off to lighten load on MAIN A?
Okay. We're perusing that subject right now, Jack. It's really not that big a thing, just something we wanted to dress up.
Okay.
Okay, Aquarius; Houston.
Go ahead.
Say, Jim, as something to try, you might have Jack turn off the RING 1's AUTO coils, which are probably on MAIN A. Have him turn those off and take a look at the readings.
Okay.
Okay. Jack has turned off RING 1 that was on MAIN A, and he's still reading 30.2 volts.
Roger that, Jim. What's his amperage? Did he read that off?
I guess. He says it's down in the mud; it's less than 2 amps.
Down in the mud. Okay, understand that. Request he turn them back on and - Okay, Jim, that's the AUTO coils back on RING 1, MAIN A, and when you get that done, I'd like you to copy the entry pad.
Okay, Joe. Standing by to copy the entry pad.
Okay, here we come. Entry pad: Mid-Pacific, 000153; 000. The next two lines will be the GET of moonset and the Moon-check attitude; 142:38:17, 178; NOUN 61, minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 06.7; 36211, 6.51; 1168.9, 36292; 142:40:40; 00:28. The next four are N/A; D<sub>O</sub> is 4.00, 02:04; 00:17, 03:22, 08:14; 33, 353.1, 29.9. Boresight star is Sigma Libra, down 08.8, left 0.4; lift vector up. Comments: GDC for entry alinement, stars 31 and 23. The roll aline 041, pitch 245, yaw 024, use EMS nonexit pattern. Maintain Moon-check attitude until moonset; then go to entry attitude or track horizon with the 36-degree window mark. Last comment: constant g entry is roll right. Over.
Entry pad as follows: Mid-PAC, 000153, 000; 142:38:17, 178; minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 06.7; 36211, 6.51; 1168.9, 36292; 142:40:40; 00:28. Next four columns are N/A; D<sub>O</sub> is 4.00, 02:04; 00:17, 03:22 08:14; 33, 353.1, 29.9. Zebra Libra, or something like that, Beta Libra is down 08.8, left 0.4; lift vector up; GDC entry alined, stars 31, 33. Roll 041, pitch, 045, yaw 024. EMS nonexit pattern to be used; maintain Moon-check attitude until moonset. and if all else is lost, the constant g entry is right - Roll is right.
Okay. Roger that, Jim. I want to verify a couple of things I'm not sure I heard you read back. The first one was Zebra Libra (laughter) that's Sigma Libra. The set stars 31 and 23. Did you get that? Over.
Okay. No, I had 31 and 33, and I got Sigma Libra now, and it'll be 31 and 23 for the set stars.
Okay. And your GDC pitch aline, I wasn't sure whether that was - whether you read back 245 or 045. The correct number is 245. Over.
Good show, because I have 045 down. 245.
Okay. And the Moon check here, unlike the horizon check, is on the 36-degree window mark all the way. Just wanted to repeat that.
Moon check on 30-degree window mark.
That's 36-degree window mark, Jim.
Three six. Roger.
Okay. Readback correct. And, Aquarius; Houston. If you want me to read you the landing area summary, I'll do that.
Sounds good.
Okay. In the mid-Pacific landing area, the weather is good. The cloud cover is 2000, scattered; visibility, 10; winds 060 at 10; wave heights are 4 feet, and the altimeter 2986, if you care. Scattered showers less than 10 percent of the area. Recovery forces are as follows: the Iwo Jima will be at the touchdown point, the aircraft call sign will be Recovery 1, on station with swimmers on board. The - we have the constant g backup reentry area covered with the USS Hall, the Good Liberty Ship, and the other recovery aircraft whose call signs you may hear are Samoa Rescue C-130s.
Okay, fine. We have the Iwo Jima as the prime recovery ship.
That's correct.
Joe, Jack tells me he is still having trouble looking through the optics. I'm just going to pitch up a little bit more here to see if he can get into the dark spot.
Okay, real fine. You might tell him when we get to that point, we have some - some stars with corresponding shaft and trunnion angles to pass to him as backups in case the computer doesn't happen to point him straight at one. And it's the Summer Triangle.
And are you tracking us, and do you have any results on that last midcourse?
Stand by. It looks good. I'll try and get you numbers.
It feels nice to use the hand controller again.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
I just said, Joe, it feels nice to use the hand controller again.
Oh. Roger that. FIDO says he's got you nailed within a half a foot per second; the midcourse looked real good.
Okay.
And I've got two things we'd like Jack to do in the command module to ease the load on MAIN A. One of them is to verify or turn the CM/RCS HEATER switch to OFF. We're done with that, and even though the circuit breakers are pulled, the switches might be drawing a little current. And the second one is, we'd like him to turn SCS LOGIC POWER 2/3 to OFF; we don't need it now. It's called up in the checklist at the appropriate time, and we'd like him to turn that off. Over.
Okay. I'll tell Jack to check that the CM/RCS HEATER switch is off, and, if not, we'll turn it off; and also to turn off the SCS LOGIC POWER 2/3 switch, OFF, since it comes up later in the checklist.
That's correct.
Houston, Aquarius. We're recording MAIN A voltage up to 31.0.
Roger. That's 31.0. We're smiling.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go, Aquarius.
Okay. How about if I hold a pitch attitude of about 115 instead of about 91. I think Jack can use the optics a little bit better at that angle.
Jim, that's perfectly okay with us, if it looks good for stars.
He just looked at them briefly; I'll go down and look at them a little bit better here.
Okay. With the new attitude, our shaft and trunnion angles we were going to pass him don't mean anything, but it's more important to have a good star field.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. We - We've been talking about your going to a different attitude than the pad attitude for better star field vision out the command module, and what we'd like to have you do is this. If you can predict now or sometime soon, what attitude it is that you would like to hold at that time, and go to that attitude now, we'd like to be able to compute the coarse aline gimbal angles for the CSM, and we can do that if you go to the selected attitude, hold it, call up a VERB 06 NOUN 20, and read us your LM gimbal angles, we can take those and compute CSM coarse aline gimbal angles on the assumption that, when we get back into the CSM coarse aline, you will return to that selected attitude. Does that sound okay? Over.
Yes. I'll try to hold the attitude we select directly, while you're giving us the coarse aline attitude. We're not too sure what - what's the best attitude. I'm going to ask Jack again if 115 is sufficient for him.
Okay. You can take some time figuring out the best attitude, and then you won't have to hold it all the way from now until then, if you just get back to it.
Houston, Jack would like to know what constellations are in his sextant, or scanning telescope, field of view at an attitude of about 105 pitch, zero roll, zero yaw. Can you give that to us?
Okay. We'll sure give it a go. As I said, we - We have some stars. They're not - They're not centered with the shaft and trunnion zero. Let us take a quick look at 105 pitch, shaft and trunnion zero, and see if we can get you an answer.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. These - None of these stars will be exactly centered, but, at a pitch attitude of 115, we had computed that Vega, Altair, Rasalhague, and Deneb would all be in the telescope field of view, and the first three were also in view at the 91-degree pitch, so he should be able to see one or more of those four stars. Over.
Okay. Thank you, very much.
Okay. And, Jim, I can give shaft and trunnions if - if he's interested.
Okay. Why don't you give us the shaft and trunnion for - say, Altair at 115, and I'll go up there, and I'll see if he can pick it up.
Okay. Real fine, At 115 degrees of pitch, Altair, shaft 274, trunnion 22.2. Over.
Roger. Shaft is 274, trunnion 22.2.
That's affirm.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay, Jim. In the LM, there we have - We show battery 3 only drawing about an amp, and we think it's probably time to get it off the line; battery 3 to OFF/RESET. Over.
Battery 3 is OFF/RESET.
Okay.
Just how's our power consumption, Houston, just out of curiosity?
I'll verify it, Jim. I'm sure it's okay.
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. With the present amount of power you've got in the LM, which is over 500 amp-hours, and the rate you're using them, we figure you've got almost 12 hours of power left.
Twelve hours, huh? We could reenter with it.
That's affirm.
That's enough for two touch-and-goes and a full stop, Jim.
That's right, Joe; if you could dig a crater like Cone Crater, I could might hit it.
(Laughter) Okay.
Jack reports that he thinks he can see Altair.
Very good.
He says, he thinks he can see Altair.
Okay. I'll take back the "very," but I'll leave the "good."
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
I ran back there to take a look and see what I could see in the - in the scanning telescope. It looks pretty grim back there right now. It might be that we have to go with the coarse aline, and maybe computation of some fine aline docking angles, if we have time.
Okay. We'd like to do that, too. Wait a minute; stand by, Jim.
Aquarius, Houston. How do you read?
I read you loud and clear.
Okay. What we'd like to do, Jim, is - We'll go ahead and get the coarse aline to the gimbal angles that - that you're going to be holding for us; and we'll get the platform up, and then when you call P52 and you use PICAPAR, it probably won't be close enough to put the star in the sextant, but if you can see any kind of a bright star in the general vicinity, - and like general vicinity, I mean 2 to 3 degrees from the center of the telescope, so that you have some clue as to which way to go, then the identification problem shouldn't present much of a - of a difficulty. And once you get the thing in the sextant, then you can go ahead and treat it like any other PICAPAR.
That sounds great, Ken. One little problem: there's all sorts of bright objects floating around us, and also that just staring at part of Aquarius; it's just reflecting light like mad. We can give it a try. There's no problem there; if we can see it, we'll get it.
Okay. And in - in the event that that doesn't work, we're standing by with the original scheme, a set of LM FDAI angles to fly to that'll point the command module optics at the Moon and the Sun; so we can always go back to that.
Okay.
And, Aquarius, Houston. We'd like you to verify the SUIT RELIEF valve to closed. Over.
Stand by. It's closed.
Okay.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go.
We'll go with your original 91-degree angle, if you have the stars figured out, and the coarse aline angle for it.
Okay. Roger that, Jim. Then at - at your convenience here, we'd like you to go to that attitude, as close as you can get, and call up a NOUN 20 for us.
Okay. In work now.
Okay.
Houston, Aquarius.
Go ahead, Aquarius.
Okay. I take it that, if - if Jack cannot see stars at this attitude after you give him the coarse aline angles, we're just not going to read down to you our gimbal angles and have you figure out a target angle for Jack, but you want him to do sighting on the Moon and the Sun. Is that correct?
That's roughly correct, Jim. Jack will coarse aline at that attitude. This is what we're having you maneuver to the - to that attitude for. We're going to compute coarse aline gimbal angles and pass them up to him, and the first thing he'll do when he gets there, per his checklist, is to coarse aline his platform. Then he'll go into the P52, and, if he can't see stars, we will quickly pass up to you the - your FDAI angles to put him in the Moon-view attitude, and he'll do his P52 on the Moon, and then have you maneuver on the Sun and complete the P52 of the Sun.
Okay. But I'm going to have to maneuver to the Moon to help him out.
Oh. That's - That's affirmative. If he can't see stars at the - at the SEP attitude that - that you'll be holding, you'll have to maneuver to the Moon attitude and then to the Sun attitude for him.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Just like to mention that, even if, for some reason, we run out of time or something and don't complete the Moon-Sun P52, Jack will have a platform coarse aline to the entry REFSMMAT, which we feel will be plenty good enough.
Roger. That's my feelings, too.
Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Hello there, Houston.
Hi! Jim, we - We've gone ahead and computed the CSM coarse aline gimbal angles based on your being at the service module SEP attitude at the time that Jack cranks up the computer and - and coarse alines the IMU. That is, we assume that you're going to be at roll, 0; pitch, 091; yaw, 0; and, if you concur on that, I'd like to pass up the angles for - for Jack to have.
Okay. I'll be there to the best of my ability.
Good show. You ready to copy?
Go ahead.
Okay. CSM coarse aline angles: ROLL, plus 298.95; PITCH, plus 271.30; YAW, plus 000.20.
Okay. The command module angles will be: ROLL, 298.95; PITCH, 271.30; and YAW, 000.20.
That's affirmative, and that's for his VERB 41 NOUN 20 when he gets there.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston; Aquarius here.
Okay, Jim. We're getting about 9 minutes from the commencement of command module powerup, and we wanted to just mention to you for Jack's benefit that, although the batteries are looking real good, in case they're cool and have a little difficulty hacking the load just at first, we'd like him to monitor main bus voltage to 24 volts or above during the powerup procedure and, if it falls below, we'll have a couple of circuit breakers for him that - that will solve the problem.
Okay. And I take it you're also monitoring main bus voltage.
Negative. Not in the command module at this time, because we don't call up telemetry until a little bit later on.
Ah so. That's right; I forgot. Okay. I will tell him.
Thank you.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. You're GO to start powering up the command module.
Right-o. We're starting now.
Okay.
Okay. We have LM power breakers.
Okay. Houston, you're looking at it.
Okay. Roger. Stand by.
Okay. Press on, Fred.
Okay.
Okay. That's - That's it, Joe.
Okay. Real good.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We have command module AOS. Request OMNI Charlie in the CM. Over.
OMNI Charlie. Okay. Standby.
Coming up.
Okay.
That was sent through a new onboard communication system known as yelling through the tunnel.
(Laughter) The 1MC.
I've got Fred up there with Jack now helping to power up the CM, and I'm staying down in good old Aquarius.
Understand, Jim.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Just to inform you. We've got data from the - from Odyssey, and it looks good.
Hey, great
Houston, Aquarius. Odyssey is trying to call. Can you read them?
Negative. Don't read Odyssey yet; has he got his intercom panel configured?
I'll doublecheck. They're hearing you.
Okay. Good deal. I don't hear them, yet.
Are you ready for an E-MEMORY dump, VERB 74?
Stand by for just 1 minute, Jim.
We've got a lot of things to do, Houston.
I know it. Okay, Aquarius; Houston. Recommend in Odyssey that he switch the POWER AMPLIFIER to LOW. Over.
POWER AMPLIFIER to LOW.
It's been switched to LOW, Houston.
Roger. Okay. Verify the POWER AMP talkback is gray, Jim.
Okay. That's verified.
Okay.
Aquarius Houston.
Go ahead.
We have high bit rate; we are standing by for the VERB 74 ENTER and the E-MOD dump.
Roger. Thank you.
Joe, how do you read?
Okay. Read you, babe.
Okay, Loud and clear. VERB 74 coming down.
Okay. Copy that, Jack.
And I'll be ready for your P27 update.
Okay.
And I'm in ACCEPT.
Okay. Understand you are in P00 and ACCEPT. Verify OMNI Charlie.
Okay. Joe, we are OMNI Charlie. We have little bit better signal strength on another OMNI.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay, Odyssey; Houston. Select your own best OMNI and then repeat VERB 74 ENTER. Over.
Okay, Odyssey; Houston. We are locked on solid high bit rate now; repeat the VERB 74 ENTER. Over. Delay that; hold the VERB 74 1 minute. Wait.
You're too late, Joe; it's coming down.
Okay, Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We are going to skip the E-MOD dump for right now and get the uplink in.
Okay. P00 and ACCEPT.
Okay. P00 and ACCEPT. And, Jack, you can go ahead with the IMU and optics powerup. Over.
Roger. It's in work.
Okay.
... unable to read any BAT B voltage. We do have current, though, on BAT B.
Okay. Copy that, Fred.
Why don't you check?
You're looking good on the ground, Odyssey.
Okay.
And I think the reason you don't read voltage is it's a circuit breaker that we have called as being out.
All right.
Odyssey, Houston. The uplink is going well. We have one more load to get in.
Okay. Real fine.
Is the computer mine now, Joe?
Stand by 1 second.
Okay, Jack. We'd like the VERB 74 ENTER, and it'll take less than a minute for E-MOD dump.
Coming down.
And, Jack, Houston. It'll be 100 seconds on that.
Okay. Can I go to BLOCK on the UP TELEMETRY?
Not just yet, Jack.
Odyssey, Houston. You can go to UP TEL BLOCK. Over,
UP TEL BLOCK and the computer is mine.
Not yet, Jack. We're still in the E-MOD dump. And, Aquarius, Houston.
Go head, Houston.
Okay. We're coming up on time for the coarse aline, Jim, so you can hold your attitude real good.
Roger.
And, Odyssey, Houston. The computer is yours. You can press on.
Okay,
Houston, Aquarius.
Aquarius, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. He just did the coarse aline. I'm going to the jettison attitude.
Copy that.
Aquarius, Houston. I copied that you - that he's completed the coarse aline; he's going into the P52 now? Is that right?
Let me check. I think he is.
Okay. You're staying at your present attitude, aren't you?
Yes. We'll - I'll stay in the present attitude.
Roger that.
Okay, Houston. I got a 220 alarm here. ...
Roger that.
... ...
Odyssey, Houston. Have you set the drift light and the REFSMMAT light? Over.
Odyssey, Houston.
... flag.
You were noisy; I didn't copy. Have you set the drift and REFSMMAT flag?
Okay, Joe. I don't have a star in the sextant. I'm going to hunt for it in a minute.
Roger that, Jack.
Okay, Joe. Can you give me any stars that I might try here?
That's affirmative. Vega and Altair should be good. Vega is 36, Altair is 40.
Okay. We'll give that a try.
Okay. And you might look for them in the telescope if they're not in the sextant right off. They should be close to the crosshairs.
Okay. I got all that material that's venting from the bottom of the command module.
Roger that.
I have an RCS light, Houston.
Okay, Jim. That's the one we warned you about some time ago. Low helium; no sweat.
Oh, okay.
Okay, Houston. There's a star angle difference with stars 36 and 40.
How about that, baby.
An odd maneuver, Houston.
Roger that. Copy you're maneuvering to the LM JETT attitude. Is that right?
That's affirm - -
That's affirm.
I'm going to torque those gimbal angles.
Torque them, babe, full stroke gimbal.
There it is. Okay. I'll do a star check.
Okay.
Okay, Odyssey. You're suddenly ahead of the time line.
Odyssey, Houston. Request OMNI Bravo.
I am OMNI Bravo, Jim.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. The sextant star check passes.
Say again, Jack.
I did a star check, and it passes. It puts that star right in the telescope.
Good enough. You can press on in the checklist, Jack.
Find out LM gimbal lock, Jim.
It's the command module's gimbal lock I'm worried about.
(Laughter) Okay.
Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. If you concur, we would be inclined to recommend that you go to AGS for the maneuver because you'll have to be there later on anyway.
Okay.
And AGS PULSE is the recommendation.
We're having trouble maneuvering, Joe, without getting it in gimbal lock.
Okay. You can - -
You picked a lousy attitude, though, to separate.
Well, we apologize. Just take your time. Jim, we've got time now.
Okay.
Houston, why can't I stay in PGNS ATT HOLD for the LM attitude hold?
Stand by on that, Jim.
Aquarius, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. Our recommendation is that you stay in AGS for the LM JETT simply because we've thought it through. We've got the right deadbands and all set up. Over.
Okay. It's a lot easier for me to maneuver in PGNS, Joe, than it is AGS.
Yes. You can maneuver in PGNS, Jim. I'm sorry, I thought you were talking about the ATT HOLD and the LM JETT afterward. You can maneuver in PGNS if you want to.
I want to get way over here, Joe. To prevent him into gimbal lock, I have the yaw at about - I'd say about almost 50 degrees.
Roger that. Just stay out of gimbal lock and that 45-degree isn't critical - the out of plane, that is.
Odyssey, Houston. Request OMNI Charlie.
Okay. Going OMNI Charlie.
Thank you.
There.
Okay. Good.
Roger. That's VERB 46. Roger. Aquarius, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jim. The particular DAP configuration we have set up now is using more fuel than we'd like out of system B. We'd like you to reconfigure the DAP to 30021. Over.
Thank you.
Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'd like to have you turn the optics power off until you need them again, and we would like to have you check the RCS ring 1 and 2 temps for us. Over.
Optics power going off.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. Our ring 1 is 50; ring 2 is plus 42.
Ring 1 is 50; copy. What was the other?
42.
Got it. Thank you.
Okay, Houston; Aquarius. I am at the LM SEP attitude and I'm planning on bailing out.
Okay. I can't think of a better idea, Jim.
I'll go to AGS ATT HOLD, if you want me to.
We recommend that, Jim.
Okay, Aquarius; Houston. In AGS ATT HOLD, we recommend WIDE DEADBAND. Over.
I'm in the AGS DEADBAND.
Roger.
Aquarius, Houston. Don't forget the ...
You need to relay something downstairs, Jim?
Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead, Joe.
Okay. Our troops would like to have you go to the SYSTEMS TEST METER and read out the injector temps on RCS for us.
Okay. Okay. In work.
Okay, Houston. Let me read out the injector temperatures for you.
Go ahead.
5 Charlie, 4.2; 5 Dog, 4.6; 6 Alfa, 4.3; 6 Bravo, 4.3; 6 Charlie, 3.6; 6 Dog, 3.6.
Okay. Copy that. No complaints.
Okay. We're ready to proceed with hatch closeup.
Okay. Did Jim get the film out of Aquarius?
Yes. We - You mean the film we took this morning?
That's affirm.
Yes, We've transferred that.
Okay. Good deal. Jack, let me mention something about the hatch integrity check. You're going to vent the tunnel until you get a 3-psi DELTA-P. That should take 9 or 10 minutes, and it's our firm feeling that you don't have to wait another 10 minutes after that for a leak check. If it holds pressure for a minute or so or even gets down there, you know you've got a good hatch. Over.
Okay. Copy that.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. We've got an O<sub>2</sub> FLOW HIGH.
Okay, Jack, are you -
Well, we might be pressurizing a lot of the system that was not pressurized.
Roger. I expect that's the case. Let us check it.
Okay. Take a good look at CABIN.
Will do.
Odyssey, Houston, just verify your DIRECT O<sub>2</sub> is OFF. Over.
Yes, sir. That is verified.
Okay, and - -
... It's dropping now, Joe.
Roger. We think that you were just pressurizing the cabin up to that regulator's particular SPEC.
Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We're observing middle gimbal angle getting a little bit high. The LM appears to be deadbanding okay within its attitude, but just wanted you to know that we're keeping an eye on it and if it does get too high, we might want you to punch off early.
Okay.
And verify that the hatch is secured and that you are venting the tunnel. Over.
That's verified. We have a DELTA-P of 2.8.
Real good. Real good.
Okay, Joe. Since we're ahead of the time line, can I proceed on and kind of punch off early, or do you want me to punch off at exactly 1 hour?
Jack, when you are comfortably ready to punch off, you can go ahead and do it.
Odyssey, Houston. We just had a formal GO for LM JETT at your convenience. Over.
Okay. Thanks, Joe.
Okay.
Okay, Odyssey; Houston. We're ready for you to bring the BMAGs ON and WARM UP and all other things being equal, we'd like you to go through the LM JETT at - on the checklist you've got. And that is BMAGs 1 - -
Okay. Will do.
- - 1. That's BMAG 1 now, as you know.
Yes, BMAG 1 is in WARM UP.
Okay, Houston. Do you have a command module weight for me?
Stand by 1, Jack.
Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. I'm reminded that the entry DAP is all you've got. It'll initialize itself, and you won't have an - you won't have an RCS DAP, so you don't have to fool with it.
Okay.
Okay, Joe. I'm - Have you got your checklist out there on the SPS powerup?
That's affirm.
Okay. I'm coming down here to a step that says FDAI POWER, off. Is that what you want right now, I guess, huh?
Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. That FDAI POWER, OFF, is to stop momentary gliches as you bring up the BMAG to put it on, and you turn right around and put the FDAI POWER right back on 1.
Okay. And I don't have the BMAG TEMP light out yet. Do you want me to go ahead and put the BMAG ON with the TEMP light still ON?
That's affirm. We can go ahead and you'll have a good stable rate.
All right. Let's do it.
Okay, Houston. We'll punch off at 141 plus 30.
Okay, Jack. We copy and we concur.
Okay, Houston. Do we have a GO for PYRO ARM?
Odyssey, Houston. We can give you a GO if you'll put the LOGIC ON momentarily first.
Okay. The SECs LOGIC is on.
Okay. Just copied that, and you are GO for PYRO ARM.
Real fine.
10 seconds.
Five. LM jettison.
Okay, copy that. Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.
Watch gimbal lock there, Jack.
Yes, we did.
Odyssey, Houston. Request OMNI Bravo.
Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. We'll have a pad for you in a few minutes. We're getting data now on the tracking, and although we suspect the changes from your preliminary pad will be very small, we recommend that you hold off on initializing the EMS until we get you the final pad. Over.
Okay. Will do.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. The sextant star check passes.
Houston, copy. Good show. That was some P52, Jack.
Yes. I was kind of lucky, I guess.
Give you a big gold star for that.
Thank you.
Hey, Joe. We're standing by to copy your new pad.
Okay, Jack. It'll be a few minutes yet. We want to get it right up to speed.
Okay. I can proceed with EMS check, can't I, Joe?
That's affirmative, Jack. You can go ahead with that.
Odyssey, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Jim. Your CABIN is looking real good. We recommend you turn the SUIT COMPRESSOR to OFF now. Over.
Going OFF. Boy, it's nice and quiet in here.
Okay, real good. Incidentally, your power is looking real good also, Jim.
Thank you.
Odyssey, Houston. I have your final entry pad when you are ready.
Okay, Houston. Ready to copy.
Okay. Mid-PAC, 000152, 000; 142:38:19, 178; and you recall that's GET moonset and Moon-check attitude. NOUN 61, minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 05.2; 3621.1, 6.20; 1119.7, 36291; 142:40:46; 00:30; the next four are N/A; D<sub>O</sub> is 4.00, 02:20; 00:19, 03:38, 07:59. The rest of the pad is N/A for this one. You are lift vector up at the very bottom. And the remarks all remain the same; if you want me to copy them, let me know; otherwise, you can read back. Over.
Okay. Entry pad as follows: Mid-PAC, 000152, 000; 142:38:19, 178; minus 21.66, minus 165.37; 05.2; 3621.1, 6.20; 1119.7, 36291; 142:40:46; 00:30; all the DLS are N/A. DO is 4.00, 02:20; 00:19, 03:38, 07:59. All the rest are N/A, except lift vector which is up; and I have the the ...
Okay, Jim. That's a tiny hair shallower than we had you before, but it's based on solid tracking, and it still is lift vector up comfortably.
Roger. We never did bring that angle up, did we?
No, actually, we didn't.
Odyssey, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, Jack. We'd like P00 and ACCEPT for your final state vector.
You've got it.
And, Odyssey, Houston. We're also sending you a final PIPA bias update and clock increment. Over.
Okay. Fine; thank you, Joe. How does the LM look? Are you still tracking it?
All I've heard was that it's that the cabin was holding pressure. I haven't heard anything more. And, Odyssey, we're ready for you to warm up the BMAG number 2's at your discretion and we're curious whether the Moon check attitude is good. Over.
Yes, Joe, it's coming down. I got just about 45 degrees now and it's coming on down.
Roger that.
Odyssey, Houston. The computer is yours. Over.
Okay. Thanks, Joe.
Okay, Joe. The Moon is coming down to about 38 degrees. ... - -
Okay, Jack. Sounds real good.
Odyssey, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like the S-BAND POWER AMPLIFIER to OFF, center, at this time, Jim.
OFF, center, is done.
Okay. You're still looking real fat on power. We show you having over 30 amps on the water. If you do get into a bind and don't come up - that's amp-hours - don't come up with Recovery, you can always power down and you can always put the pyro batteries on the line if you need them after you're down.
Okay.
Joe, are you planning to run this all the way down without the suit compressor?
Say again, Jack.
Are you planning to turn on the suit compressor at all on the way down?
That's a negative Jack; I'll verify it, but I sure don't think so.
Okay. That's all right with us.
Okay, Jack. This is Houston. We've got POWER, and you can cycle it for 10 minutes if you so desire, but we don't think you need to do it. Over.
Okay. We'll hold out.
Okay. Real fine. How did the EMS check go, Jack?
EMS checked out okay - -
Good deal.
- - been initialized and sitting on ENTRY.
Roger.
Okay, Joe. Are you watching - you and FIDO taking a look at our NOUN 60 here?
That's affirmative. Hold it just a second; we are looking at 6.13 and 4.80. I'll get a check on that.
Okay. That's not too many g's.
Jack, FIDO says that's okay.
Okay.
Jack, Houston. Your NOUN 63 looks good to us.
Okay.
Joe, how far out do you show us now?
Oh, on our plotboard up here, we can't hardly see how far out you are.
Okay.
I know all of us here want to thank all you guys down there for the very fine job you did.
That's affirm, Joe.
I'll tell you - We all had a good time doing it.
Okay, Odyssey; Houston. Just for your information, it looks as though battery C will deplete around main chute time; that's expected; you've got plenty of amp-hours in the other batteries.
Odyssey, Houston. Over.
Odyssey, Houston. Over.
Odyssey, Houston. Over.
Odyssey, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay, I was just going to tell you about that handover we just had, but I was a little late on the - on the ball. Since we're fat on power and we'd kind of like to have S-band with you after blackout - we'd - We'd like you to delete the step on your entry checklist page 2-5, after "Begin blackout," it says "POWER PMP to OFF." We'd like you to leave it on if you think of it. Over.
Okay.
Okay.
Odyssey, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. At 10 minutes to 400 K, you're looking good; we're real happy with the trajectory, and a minute ago, we just lost contact with your friend Aquarius.
Okay. Where did she go?
Oh, I don't know. She's up there somewhere.
She sure was a good ship.
Hey, just as I said that, we got another burst of LM data, so I guess it's still ticking.
Odyssey, Houston. Your DSKY is doing all the right things. The G&N is GO. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
You have a good bedside manner, Joe.
Say again, Jack.
You have a good bedside manner.
(Laughter) That's the nicest thing anybody's ever said! How about that?
Sure wish I could go to the FIDO party tonight.
(Laughter) Yes, it's going to be a wild one.
Somebody said, "We'll - We'll cover for you guys; and, if Jack's got any phone numbers he wants us to call, why, pass them down."
Odyssey, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay; We just had one last time around the room and everybody says you're looking great.
Thank you.
Odyssey, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Okay. LOS in about a minute or a minute and a half; in entry attitude, we'd like OMNI Charlie, and welcome home. Over.
Thank you.
Odyssey, Houston standing by. Over.
Okay, Joe.
Okay. We read you, Jack.
We're looking at the weather on TV and it looks just as advertised; real good.

Roger. Houston, Apollo 8. Reading you loud and clear. TLI plan 24136 179 045 001 515 105196 35569 357 091 001; TLI plus 10, abort attitude 199 on the pitch.
Roger, Apollo 8. That is correct. We'd like to double check one number on the TLI plus 90 minutes. When you can dig that out, let us know.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. It's - the sextant shaft angle should be 2027. Over.
Roger. Sextant shaft is 2027.
Thank you, sir.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. S-IVB looking good, both from a guidance and a consumable viewpoint; it all looks GO.
Roger.
The DSE is all yours, Bill.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We will have LOS in 1 minute; we'll pick you up again over Tananarive at 02:09.
Roger, Michael. Thank you.
Roger. How does it feel up there?
Very good, very good. Everything is going rather well. It looks just about the same way it did 3 years ago.
Has Bill got time from playing with his tape recorder to look out the window?
Roger. We had one little incident here. Jim Lovell inadvertently popped one liferaft, so we've got one full Mae West with us here.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston through Tananarive. Over.
Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Roger, Apollo 8. We don't have anything for you; we are just standing by. You're looking good.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Gemini 8 - correction: Apollo 8.
Roger. Gemini 8, Houston. We would like to bring you up to date on the COMM situation while we've got some quiet time here. We'll be LOS Tananarive in another 2 minutes; we'll be picking you up over Carnarvon at 2 hours 25 minutes and 22 seconds. LOS Carnarvon will be 02:31:55; then we've got ARIA number 1 coming in about 02:37:30; and after that, we will have a hand-off to Mercury to Hawaii to Goldstone, and we should have continuous COMM. Over.
Very good. That's very good. Thank you.
Roger.
Thought you were Gemini 7, not 8.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo.
Roger. Loud and clear. We'd like to take your tape recorder for 2 minutes, please.
Can he have it, Bill?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
By the way, we read out the voice tape, and quality of the voice tape is good - from the DSE.
Good.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Alright, Apollo 8. You are GO for TLI. Over.
Roger. We understand we are GO for TLI.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We will have LOS in about 30 seconds, and we'll pick you up over ARIA 1 at 02:37:30.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. I hear you garbled but fairly clear.
Roger. Apollo 8, Houston. We're transmitting through ARIA 1, and you are also garbled.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Good; you're loud and clear through the Mercury, and you're looking good dawn here. Everything looks good.
Roger. Understand. Our O<sub>2</sub> flow is a little bit higher than I thought, but Bill says that it's just about what he expected.
Roger. Understand.
Your He flow looks good down here.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're looking good.
Roger.
Apollo 8, coming up on 20 seconds to ignition. Mark it, and you're looking very good.
Roger.
IGNITION.
Roger. IGNITION.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're looking good.
Apollo 8, Houston. Trajectory and guidance look good. Over.
Roger. Apollo 8, looks good here.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're predicting cut-off, 02:55:58, and it looks exactly nominal here.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. That predicted cut-off, 02:55:52, 52, and that's exactly as it should be.
02:55:52.
Apollo 8, Houston. You are looking good here, right down the center line.
Roger. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. You are looking good, right down the old center line.
Roger. Apollo 8.
Okay - We got SECO right on the money.
Roger. Understand; SECO.
Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like a good cut-off. Everything is looking real good down here.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Your cut-off looked very good down here. We have a whole room full of people that say you look good.
Roger. Thank you. The only situation we have here in the O<sub>2</sub> flow is high, O<sub>2</sub> flow is a bit high.
Roger. Understand; O<sub>2</sub> flow high.
We'll get to first status report here shortly.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Your booster configured normally, and we're not concerned with the O<sub>2</sub> high flow. We think it's normal.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. The DELTA-TIG looked like it was right on. Burn time appeared to us to be about 2 seconds longer, 517. VGX was reading 95485 when we got it. The attitude was nominal. V<sub>I</sub> was reading 35452 at cut-off, H-dot 04552, and H is 01791. ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> on the EMS was minus 20.6.
Roger. We copy that, Jim, and I've got some times here for you.
Roger. Go ahead.
Booster begins maneuver to SEP attitude at 03:10:55. Takes 5 minutes, so it arrives at 03:15:55, and SEP time, 03:20:55. Your SEP attitude, the gimbal angles on the PAD remain good.
Roger. I have those times. The SEP time will be 03:20:55.
Right.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Going to start charging battery B.
Okay. Battery B.
And would you keep a special eye on the purge tank and cryo O<sub>2</sub> tank 1 ΔV|DELTA-V for us since our flowmeter is pegged out, we got no warning on O<sub>2</sub> high flow.
Roger, Bill. We'll do that for you.
Thank you.
Okay. Maneuvers started to separation attitude.
Roger, Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Yes, reading you loud and clear, Frank. Understand you've started the maneuver to SEP attitude.
Roger.
Are you reading us alright?
Loud and clear.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. Coming up on 3 hours and 15 minutes as per flight plan; we have you GO.
Roger. GO.
You got any reading on that O<sub>2</sub> flow?
Stand by one.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
We're reading about the same as we were before on that oxygen flow. The reason it's that high is due to the cabin gas changeover. According to Apollo 7, if your data repeats theirs, you can expect it to be high for another few hours.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
You can expect that the S-IVB will be 10 degrees off in pitch at SEP attitude; however, that is GO. There is no problem involved.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We have you about 30 seconds prior to separation, and everything's looking good.
Roger.
What a view!
Looks pretty good, huh?
We've SEP'd Houston. We got the S-IVB|IVB, right?
Roger. Apollo 8.
Houston, do you read Apollo 8?
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
This is Apollo 8 on VHF and S-band. How do you read?
Hear loud and clear, Bill. How me?
Read you loud and clear. We have SEP and looking good.
Roger. Looking good here.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear, Frank. How us?
Roger. Loud and clear. We are taking pictures of the S-IVB; the postseparation sequence is completed, and we seem to have a high gain.
Okay; fine.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Is Bill reedy for his VHF test? We can configure any time he is.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We would like to ask whether you did a VERB 66 ENTER to transfer the state vector from CSM to LM slot. We didn't copy that down here.
We did not.
Okay.
Do you want us to do that now?
At your convenience.
Roger.
We see the earth now, almost as a disk.
Good show. Get a picture of it.
We are.
Tell Conrad he lost his record.
We have a beautiful view of Florida now. We can see the Cape, just the point.
Roger.
And at the same time, we can see Africa. West Africa is beautiful. I can also see Gibraltar at the same time I'm looking at Florida.
Sounds good. Get a picture of it. What window are you looking out?
The center window.
Roger.
Are your windows clear so far?
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
How about your VHF check? We would like to get that done before you get too much further away.
Okay.
We are listening on VHF alfa Simplex.
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
We are listening for VHF alfa Simplex.
Okay, good. Thank you. VHF alfa Simplex, and we will get configured for it; and in between times, give us a clue as to what it looks like from way up there.
Roger. Well, Mike, I can see the entire earth now out of the center window. I can see Florida, Cuba, Central America, the whole northern half of Central America, in fact, all the way down through Argentina and down through Chile.
They picked a good day for it.
Stand by. We are going through the separation maneuver checklist here.
Roger. Standing by.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We've lost sight of the S-IVB here. The separation maneuver may be delayed slightly, or else we will go ahead and make it without having her in sight.
Roger. Understand, Frank.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
When does the S-IVB do their blowdown maneuver?
Stand by one.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go on.
Your blowdown will be 1 hour from now, a little more that 1 hour from now.
Roger. We have the S-IVB in sight again now. We have done the separation maneuver.
Good show. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
we would like to take control of the DSE for a while, Bill.
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We would like to get an approximate GET of your SEP maneuver to use for our ephemeris tracking data.
Roger. It was 3 hours 40 minutes zero seconds.
Good, 03:40 and a foot and a half - feet per second. Right?
Roger. About that --
Okay.
-- We have the - Mike, we have the exact callout here for you and a burn status report.
Alright.
Alright, ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> minus 00011, ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>Y</sub> plus 0002, ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub> minus 0002, roll 0, pitch 180, yaw 0. Over.
Roger, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. At your convenience, would you please go P00 and ACCEPT? We're going to update to your W matrix. And also when you get a chance, we would like to know about the SLA panels. Did they all depart? And do you have any comments about the SLA?
They all departed, and they worked fine.
Okay. Thank you.
We are in P00 and ACCEPT.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Will you give us the information when you want us to stop the venting and so on?
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
Apollo 8. Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. What is the venting information are you inquiring about: the O<sub>2</sub> flow high out through the waste tank or waste compartment, or are you talking about your evaporator?
Evaporator. We are configuring now to stop boiling.
Okay.
We concur in that.
Apollo 8, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK. We have gotten in the load to the W matrix update.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. The back pressure valve is closed, and the water flow is OFF.
Back pressure valve closed, and water flow OFF. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8 here.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. It looks like I might have to do a couple more small maneuvers to stay away from the front of this S-IVB, the way we are ending up now. Do you want me to do these with our P47 if we have to do them?
Standby one, Frank.
That's affirmative, Frank, on this P47.
Okay. And give me the time again when it starts to dump, please.
Roger. We're working on an exact GET of that, Frank.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
I'd like to give you some idea about your trajectory. It looks like a midcourse correction number 1, projected out to TLI plus 6 hours, would be only 7 feet per second. So, of course, any further maneuvers you do would add to that, which is probably good.
I just want to stay from away from in front of this thing.
Roger. We concur. Looks like it is chasing you, huh?
Yes.
OMNI D.
Boy, it's starting to vent now, blowing down.
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
The S-IVB is really venting.
Roger. Understand; that is supposedly a non-propulsive vent. The big blowdown maneuver, it starts maneuvering to blowdown attitude at 04:44:55, and the vent occurs at 05:07:55.
05:07:55.
Roger.
That is the nonpropulsive vent, but it's pretty spectacular. It's spewing out from all sides like a huge water sprinkler.
Roger. Get some pictures of it.
We are.
Say again that big vent time, so I can write it down please, Houston.
Roger. Big vent time 05:07:55, and it will start maneuvering to vent attitude beginning at 04:44:55. Bill has got the tape recorder back.
Thank you. Roger.
We're receiving VHF music now, Houston. Thank you.
Yes, you took the words right out of my mouth, Frank, and we would like to know also how far away from the S-IVB you are now.
I guess we are between 500 to 1000 feet.
Roger.
Herb Alpert seems pretty good.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. I believe we are going to have to vent or thrust away from this thing; we seem to be getting closer.
Roger. Understand, Frank; go ahead whenever - just give us some idea of when you did it and how much.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Could you stand by one? We are working on something here.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
You are loud and clear, Mike. Go ahead.
Okay, Frank. On your additional separation maneuver, we recommend that you make a radial burn, point your plus X-axis toward the earth, and thrust minus X for 3 feet per second. Over.
I don't want to do that; I'll lose sight of the S-IVB.
Okay. The reason we want a radial burn is to increase your midcourse correction so we can use the SPS. Stand by on it.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
How close to a radial burn can you get without losing sight of the S-IVB, Frank?
Well, I don't know because I can't see the earth now, Mike.
Okay.
We can pitch down some. Jim has the earth in the optics so we could pitch some and get pretty close to one, I guess.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
We can give you a pitch gimbal angle on radial direction if that would be a help. It's 181 degrees; pitch gimbal angle would be exactly radial at 4 hours and 10 minutes. I don't know whether that solves your visibility problem or not.
181?
That's affirmative.
Well, then zero would be just as good, wouldn't it?
Frank, if you use zero, then make the SEP if possible in the plus X thrusters. That's the direction of the burn we'd like.
Well, can't do that. I'll thrust right square into that S-IVB.
Yes, okay. Understand.
What will he maneuver to as far as the gimbal angle for his blowdown?
Apollo 8, Houston. At blowdown, that S-IVB should be oriented to perform a retrograde blowdown along the local horizontal.
Okay.
Is it still chasing? Does it look like it is closing on you, Frank?
It is about the same. The trouble is it is pointed at us pretty well.
Roger. Understand.
Frank, what we want to do is get a radial upward burn; and as long as you can, through the optics or some other means out the window, figure out where the earth is, then use the appropriate thrusters to thrust upward, radially upward for 3 feet per second. That is what we are looking for for trajectory reasons.
Okay. Understand. I just - as I say, I just can't very well do that now. I don't want to lose sight of this S-IVB.
Roger. We concur with that. I just thought perhaps Jim, through his optics, or you could get some feel for where the earth is. That's what we want to do, is radially upward.
Okay. As soon as we find the earth, we will do it.
Thank you.
Houston. The venting on the S-IVB is terminated.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Frank, do you think you are going to be able to do this burn radially? We would like to add to its magnitude if you are going to make it in some other direction. Over.
No, I am not even sure we are going to do it yet, Mike. If I can get - we seem to be drifting away from this thing a little bit, although it is still pointing at us quite closer than I'd like.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. We would like you to do some additional maneuver; it is just a question of how much and in which direction.
Okay. Right now, our gimbal angles are about - roll's about 190 and pitch is about 320 and yaw is about 340. We could certainly do it in this position. That would be alright.
Stand by. We will check those.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. You could help us out if you would explain where you are relative to the booster. In other words, with respect to the earth and the radius back there, are you above or below or one side, or where exactly is the booster relative to you?
Well, it's as I said before. We can't definitely find the earth. I think we are in front and a little bit above - a little bit above the - almost in front of the - directly in the front of the booster.
Roger. Understand; almost directly in front of the booster.
Perhaps a little bit horizontally displaced towards the - let's see - Houston, to help you, we are looking right directly above the S-IVB with the sun - it's on the right side of the S-IVB and on our - coming in our left number 1 window.
Okay. Understand; the sun is on the right side of the S-IVB and coming in your number 1 window. And are you - when you give us those angles, that means that your plus X-axis is pointed at it with those angles. Is that affirm?
Roger.
Okay.
The earth is in our plus Y, plus Z-direction now, Mike.
Thank you. Earth is plus Y, plus Z.
Right, and a little minus X.
Okay.
Houston, for information. I am looking through the scanning telescope now, and I see millions of stars; most of them - the venting from the S-IVB.
Right. Are you having any trouble telling which are the stars and which are the S-IVB particles?
Definitely; we are in sunlight, and it looks like they are all S-IVB, but we don't know. I am going to attempt a P52 realign at this time and see what I can do.
Understand you.
Mike, anything more on this separation maneuver you're on?
We are working on it, Frank. We are trying to compute what radially outward will be in close terms. Now, you still have the earth - as I understand plus Y and plus Z quadrant. In other words, it's down below you on your right and slightly to your rear? Is that still true?
That's right. Quite a bit to our rear and down below us. Off to the right.
Okay. Well, we - of course, in that attitude, you want to burn some upward and some to the left, and we are trying to be more precise than that. Frank, is it still about the same distance away? Are you opening or closing?
It sure is staying close to us.
Understand.
Mike, can you just tell us which way the S-IVB pitches and how far it will pitch to the sling shot maneuver attitude?
Roger. Stand by.
Frank, the S-IVB is within 10 degrees of its final attitude at this time.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, are you ready to copy the IMU align information?
Go ahead.
Alright. Star ID is 03, and star 36, star angle difference 0.01, torquing angle X minus 00034, Y minus 0027, Z plus 00100. Over.
Okay, thank you. For Y, I just got four digits here: 0027.
Roger. Three zeros: 00027.
Thank you.
Houston, we are going to have to hold up on the cislunar navigation until after this next little maneuver.
Roger, Jim. We understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead now, Mike.
Can you give us an updated readout of your gimbal angles. When your plus X-axis is pointed toward the booster, please?
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Could you give us those gimbal angles, Frank, when you have a chance?
I'm getting the COAS right on it now so it will be accurate.
Thank you.
Okay. With the COAS right on the S-IVB, the roll reads 105, the pitch is 275, and the yaw is about 325.
Roger. Copy roll 105, pitch 275, and yaw 325.
Roger. That should be 115 for the roll.
Thank you. 115 roll.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. If it will help you any, Mike, the earth is plus Y about 45 degrees in a minus X. I can see it out my side window, and it's a beautiful view with numerous cloud vortex.
Roger, Bill. Thank you. Understand; plus X 45 degrees halfway between plus Y and plus Z and slightly minus X.
Negative. It's 45 degrees in the plus Y, in the XY plane towards minus X. Over.
Roger. Understand in the XY plane, toward X 45 degrees.
Forty-five degrees from plus Y to minus X.
Roger. Thank you.
It's behind us to the right, if that will help.
Roger.
I can still see the Cape and isthmus of Central America.
Roger. Understand. Frank, what we want on this burn is 8 feet per second now, 8 feet per second. We want it radially upward, and we want you to use whatever thrusters are required to burn radially upward at 8 feet per second.
Why do you want to use - do so much, Mike?
Because of the separation distance we would like to achieve between now and the time of S-IVB blowdown.
Okay.
Mike, do you want me to go ahead and try to do this, or are you going to give me some gimbal angles?
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead and do it without gimbal angles, if you can do that. Over.
Okay. I don't understand why you want so many feet per second on it, but I think I can - with just a little maneuvering, I can get away from it a lot simpler than that.
Well, we would like the radial upward for trajectory reasons, and the magnitude we'd like because of the separation distance which we're predicting you will have at S-IVB blowdown.
Okay.
VHF sounds good.
Roger. On the VHF.
OMNI B.
Understand; OMNI B Baker.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. About 12 minutes before your big blowdown, there is a small continuous vent which opens at a GET of 04:55:55. You may notice that on the booster, 12- or 15-pound thrust.
Okay.
And, Apollo 8, could you give us your burn information whenever you have it?
Roger. We are maneuvering to the attitude now.
Okay.
Okay, Houston. I understand you want 8 feet per second burn, is that right?
Right. Eight feet per second, radially upward.
Well, we are as close to being radially upward as we can determine.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Are you going to use P47 to monitor the burn?
Yes, Jim, that's Roger. We are putting it in right now.
Thank you.
Maneuvering now.
Thank you.
Houston, we made the burn at 7.7 plus X plus 00001 Y; and Z's are all zeros. Gimbal angles, roll 180, pitch 310, and yaw 020.
Roger. I copy plus X 7.7. Y 0.1; and roll, pitch, and yaw 180, 310, and 20.
Did you get that information, Houston?
Apollo 8, Houston. How are you reading?
Read you loud and clear. Did you get the information?
That's affirmative. I say again, we copied plus X 7.7, one-tenth in Y, no Z; roll, pitch, and yaw, 180, 310, and 020.
Roger. The burn was made at - initiated at 04:45.
Roger. Copy 04:45 --
Okay. Do you want us to transfer that to the CS - to the LM state vector or just leave it alone? You --
Affirmative, Frank. We would like you to transfer from the CSM to the LM state vector.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
How is that booster looking now? Is it drifting away rapidly, or how does it look?
Bill is the only one that can see it. Just a minute
We're 90 degrees from its X-axis, and we must be out 1000 feet and moving out.
Roger. Understand; 90 degrees from its X-axis and about 1000 feet and separating.
Plus or minus a couple of thousand.
Understand.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. I think we've got clearance now; we got a little behind on our P23's, but I suggest we go ahead and start those now.
Roger. Stand by.
We're well clear of the S-IVB now, Houston.
Roger, Bill. Thank you, and at your convenience, could you give us the PRD reading? And as far as the P23 goes, that's just fine to get started with it. It looks like your first star, which is number 14, should be good until about 05:15 GET. Over.
Roger. We'll start P23.
Houston, Apollo 8 with a PRD reading.
Go ahead.
Roger. At 4 hours 4 minutes, Commander is 0, CMP 0.64, LMP 0.02.
Got that. Copy left to right: 0, 0.64, and 0.02 at 4 hours and 4 minutes. Thank you.
Roger. At 04:53, it was 0.01, 0.64, 0.03, and negligible on the survey meter.
Roger. Thank you.
I have a beautiful view of the S-IVB and the earth here on one. I'll try and get a picture for you.
Hope so.
Apollo 8, Houston. We've got you about a minute away from the continuous vent open and 14 minutes away from the big dump, and we would like an estimate on your distance now if you can give it.
Stand by. Our distance is about 3000 feet we would estimate.
Thank you.
And we can see the vent.
Apollo 8. Houston. Say again.
We can see the vent.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Jim.
Boy, it's really hard to describe what this earth looks like. I'm looking out my center window, which is a round window, and the window is bigger than the earth is right now. I can clearly see the terminator. I can see most of South America, all the way up to Central America, Yucatan, and the peninsula of Florida. There is a big swirling motion just off the east coast, and then going on over toward the east, I can still see West Africa, which has a few clouds right now. We can see all the way down to Cape Horn in South America.
Good grief, that must be quite a view.
Yes. Tell the people in Tierra Del Fuego to put on their raincoats; looks like a storm is out there.
Roger. Will do. Do you care to give them a 24-hour forecast?
Probably as good as any other.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. You might be interested to know the center window is pretty well fogged up, but the other four seem to be in pretty good shape.
Glad to hear you've got four out of five, and your big dump will be coming up in 2 minutes or so.
Roger. We're standing by.
The S-IVB has started dump.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Mike, did you say star 14 was good till about 05:30 or something?
Yes. Stand by while I give you that time again. Star number 14 should be good for about another 8 minutes, Jim - 7 minutes.
Okay. Now be advised, the optics calibration is very difficult to do because of all the other little stars floating here. I'm going to ..., bypass it and do it at the end of this.
Roger, Apollo 8. Understand.
You should have the LOX dump now, Apollo 8.
Houston, this is 8. I'm looking through the scanning telescope and that LOX dump and just blanked out completely the entire scanning telescope.
Understand.
It's a fantastic sight, Bill. Looks like the S-IVB, a small attitude excursion while it's dumping.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. I've got a flight plan update for Bill if he's ready to copy.
Stand by.
Stand by.
Ready to copy.
Okay. We are about 05:10 GET where we will record the BLOCK data TLI plus four and TLI plus 11. The TLI plus four PAD that we gave you before is perfectly all right. We will not require that one, and we will have the TLI plus 11 hour PAD for you shortly, then at 05:45 or 6 hours on that high-gain antenna checkout. Roger. Standing by.
We are on OMNI D, and we heard - we lost you after - TM plus four was okay.
Okay. The TLI plus 4 hour PAD is okay. We will have the TLI plus 11 hour PAD for you shortly, and at 05:50, for your high-gain antenna checkout, we would like you to leave that switch in WIDE BEAM with reference to our conversation the other day; leave it in WIDE.
Roger. Don't want to zap your receivers.
No, it has to do with some loss of tracking data, so it is better to leave it WIDE.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8. Are you recording what we are getting out of 23?
Stand by one, Jim; I'll check.
That is affirmative, Jim; we are copying your P23.
Pretty big numbers there.
Well, we think that is because you bypassed the trunnion check.
Roger.
Houston, we are getting some really big numbers in DELTA-R and ΔV|DELTA-V.
Roger. Understand, Jim.
Do you want us to proceed with this, or should we just leave them alone?
Apollo 8, say again.
Do you want us to accept these, or should we leave them alone?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We do not wish you to accept those marks. This is due to the fact that in bypassing the trunnion bias check, you still have big numbers left in those registers, so you go ahead when - after you do the trunnion bias check. Those numbers will become small later, but do not accept them right now.
Understand, Houston.
We have a TLI plus 11 hour update for you when you are ready to copy.
Stand by.
Roger. Ready to copy TLI plus 11.
Roger, Bill. TLI plus 11, and this assumes no midcourse correction number 1: it's an SPS/G&N; 63330 minus 163 plus 129. Are you with me so far?
Roger.
Okay. 013:56:47.59 minus 00489 plus 00000 plus 47250 177 144 000, not applicable, plus 00197 47253 554 47050 12 1278 256 023, up 265, left 18. Are you with me so far?
Roger.
Okay. Plus 1197 minus 16500 12681 35608 050:46:53, GDC align north set stars, roll 068, pitch 097, yaw 356, ullage none; other: one, fast return, P37, ΔV|DELTA-V equals 7900 for Indian Ocean; number 2, high-speed procedure not required; number 3, assumes no midcourse correction number 1. Over.
Roger. TLI plus 11. SPS/G&N 63330 minus 163 plus 129 013:56:47.59 minus 00489 plus 00000 plus 47250. You copy so far?
Yes. I'm with you so far.
Apollo 8, Houston. Affirmative; I'm with you.
Roll 177 144 00 NA plus 00197 47253 554 47050 12 1278 26, correction 256 023, up 265, left 18. Copy so far?
Yes, I'm with you so far, Bill; go ahead.
Plus 1197, minus 16500 12681 35608 0506, correction 050:46:53 north set 068 097 356, zero ullage. Note one: fast return, P37, ΔV|DELTA-V 7900 Indian Ocean; two, high-speed procedure not required; three, PAD assumes no MCC 1. Over.
That's all correct, Bill.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger, Mike. I'd like to give some comments on P23 data. The auto maneuver was quite accurate. Looks like we got some substellar point in the maneuver; auto optics put Canopus straight where it should be; minimum impulse control worked as advertised. At the altitudes at which I started to do the sightings, they have a definite hazy band line. The filter gives the earth a glow, sort of an orangey glow. It's very indefinite of where to put the star, but there does seem to be a solid line where you might expect the horizon to be that appears through the haze where we expect the atmosphere to be. I followed the procedure which we had done up at MIT, about two lines atop the haze layer a definite line for these sightings. In regards to the optics calibration, it was very difficult to find a star in the landmark line of sight in the venting of the S-IVB.
Roger, Apollo 8. We copied that, and we'd like for you to do that trunnion check, that calibration, prior to your next set of sightings.
Roger. Will do. Canopus just disappeared from view, and maybe when we get a little time here, I'll try to get a calibration the first time.
Roger. Understand.
And, Houston, we've rewound the tape; you can dump it at your convenience.
Roger, Bill. Thank you. Are you still picking up anything on the VHF?
Are you playing anything?
Affirmative.
No, I'm not picking anything up.
Roger. Thank you.
What's our altitude now?
Well, you're about 22 000 miles.
Okay.
Give or take a thousand feet.
I'll go ahead and turn VHF-A off and high gain.
Roger, Bill. Thank you.
It was some pretty nice music while it lasted.
Yes, I bet so.
Apollo 8, Houston,
Go ahead, Houston.
We're going to have to wait until we get the high-gain antenna locked on again to dump the tape.
Okay. And you are about ready for us to go to the PTC attitude?
Stand by one.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'd like to hold off on the PTC and get some more P23 information. We'll have some more details of that for you shortly.
Alright.
Mike, what I'm doing now, I'm going over to the star Sirius ...
Apollo 8, Houston. You faded out completely, Jim. I heard Frank, but it faded when you began talking. Say again.
Roger. I have switched to Sirius, the second star in the first set, to see if I can't get an optics calibration on it, at least.
Roger. That's fine. We'll have some more good words for you shortly.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, on your P23, we'd like to go ahead and do the calibration and then use star number 15 and take three sets, followed by star number 16, two sets. Over.
Roger, Houston. That's what we're trying to do. I'm trying to get 15 for an optics CAL. It's been very difficult with the bright earth to find a star that we can get into the sextant. I'm trying to use the auto optics in P23 to get the star. We have that now; we're trying to maneuver the spacecraft to bring the trunnion to zero so we can get the landmark line of sight.
Roger. Understand. And I also have your PTC attitude, which is different than you have. I'll give that to you whenever you get a free moment.
Ready to copy.
Alright. PTC attitude will be pitch 242; yaw is 020. Over.
Pitch 242, yaw 020. Copy.
Very good; thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We'll hold up on the high-gain check until we get out of P23.
Roger, Bill. Thank you.
You may have to delay your lunch a little bit. Are you hungry?
No.
First time I ever heard you say that.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. It looks to us like the S-IVB is behaving completely normally in regard to all the blowdowns and other sequential events that take place. It looks good.
Roger. How far away is it from us now?
We were going to ask you.
(Laughter) Okay.
Fifty miles.
Roger. Copy.
Let's make that 80 kilometers, since there are some international aspects to this flight.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. We did an optics calibration; we get zeros all the time.
Roger. Understand; optics calibration and zeros all the time. Good.
It takes a lot longer to do it, though. I had to go to a star like Sirius to finally see it.
Roger. Understand. We are real glad you got that so we can get a horizon calibration to put in the computer.
Looks like the number 5 window is starting to fog up, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Understand it's the number 5 that is fogging up.
Houston, P23 coming through with Sirius.
Roger. Thank you.
A little better, these numbers are a little better.
We would expect so.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Have you been getting the downlink on the P23?
That is affirmative.
Okay. Now how much longer do you want us to hold off going to PTC?
Stand by one, Frank.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Are you recording all of the data from 23, or do you want some read down to you?
Stand by, Jim. We think we are getting it all. We are confirming now. That is affirmative, Jim. We are getting all that is coming down. How is it going?
It's working very nicely. I finished - one set was Sirius, three stars, and one set with Procyon, or two sightings; three sightings with Sirius and two with Procyon.
Okay, Houston. This is Apollo 8. We are ready to go to the PTC attitude.
Roger, Frank. Understand. And we understand you've completed all sets, three on one and two on another in P23. Is that right?
That's affirmative. But we've finished the five sightings, three on 15 and two on 16.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. What we are doing down here is this. We'd really like the horizon calibration. We would like a total of 15 marks; you know, three sets on one star, two on the other. On the other hand, we are balancing that with the need to go to PTC, and we are not losing sight of the fact that you want to go to PTC right away. So if you will bear with us another couple of minutes, we are trying to decide whether to ask you to go back and do some more of P23 or whether to clear you at this time to go to PTC. Over.
Okay. We started maneuvering to PTC. We are getting kind of far behind, and what I am concerned about, Mike, Jim is now taking off his pressure suit.
Roger. Understand. How about you and Bill?
Well, we are standing by till he gets through.
Understand. And you are maneuvering to PTC. That's fine.
Well, I would prefer to do that, but we will --
Okay. Stand by just one.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We would like to hold off on the passive thermal control until 7 hours GET and, in the meantime, to get as many more P23 marks as we can, starting with the first star and doing two sets of three marks each, and then going to the second star we gave you. And concurrent with that, if possible, we would like Bill to run this high-gain antenna checkout if Lovell's attitude is compatible with that.
Okay. But they have not been to date. We are almost to the passive thermal control attitude now, and Jim is just halfway through taking his suit off.
Roger. Understand.
We'll have to hold off for a minute here.
Roger, Frank. And the reason for this is the horizon calibration requires a number of points to give you good data for the onboard NAV coming on.
Roger. We understand. We will be right back with you; just have to wait a minute here.
Roger. Thank you.
That failing to separate from the S-IVB kind of fouled us up a little.
Understand.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Roger. We are standing by. Are you about ready for the high-gain antenna trial?
Okay. Just a second; we will check on that. Then are you in a position where you can go back to the star sightings?
Well, we will be, but we can't until Jim gets ready.
Okay. We will stand, and you give us a mark on that. In just a second, I will check on the antenna. Okay. It looks like we are ready to go on the high-gain antenna check. And we can either go with commands called out from the ground, and you can monitor it, or you can be talked through it, whichever you prefer.
Well, stand by. I guess we are not quite in a proper attitude yet.
Roger.
We are slowly getting it.
Houston. Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you call?
Roger. There is the high-gain antenna on wide auto.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Are you getting the results you want from our high-gain antenna?
Apollo 8, Houston. Affirmative. We are getting your data, and we may have a beam width change, but stand by on that.
Alright. We're standing by. Jim's about ready to go back to the P23.
Roger. We have a GO until 7 hours on the start of the PTC.
Roger. Seven.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
We're on the PTC mode now waiting for Jim, and I noticed that out my window now I can see Orion very clearly, even though the sun is bright in the other window.
Roger.
It almost pained me to say that, but it's true.
Roger.
Speaking of the windows, the number 5 window is getting pretty well obscured and the number 3 window is unusable.
Roger. Understand; number 3 is unusable and number 5 is obscured. Can you make out any definition at all, or do you have a target to look at?
Well, I can see the sun. Wait till it comes around the earth, and I'll give you a better hack on that.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're going to go ahead and try to dump your tape right now. Circuit margins aren't too good at our present configuration. We're going to take a look at it. If it doesn't work, we may have to dump it again at a later configuration.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're maneuvering back now to do another P23.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. I'll do two more sets on 15, and then we'll do one set on 16.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay, Apollo 8. I'd like to fill you in on things we're thinking about doing in the next couple of hours, first chance you get there.
Go ahead.
Okay. In relationship to the midcourse correction, we'd like to put that one off until about 11 hours, and it will be approximately a 25-foot-per-second burn. The reason we're delaying the burn time is to allow for better tracking as a result of the 7-1/2-foot per second you put in on the separation. We'd like to take a little more time to look at the tracking data. And the dispersions in your correction aren't going to be growing very fast here. What we'll do then is to delete the NAV sightings that occur about 09 plus 10 in the flight plan, and this will be getting us back on to the normal flight plan sequence. So we'll go ahead and finish the P23, and the 7-hour limit on that P23 is due to the range limits on this test. Over.
Is due to the what did you say?
The 7 hours on the P23 problem is due to the fact that we want to get these sightings in at a certain range. Over.
Roger. Understand.
If you have any comments on that proposal, why, go ahead and pass them down, and we'll feed them in.
No, I think that's fine. We need to get out of the suits and get something to eat here too.
Roger. Looks like we'll be back on the flight plan by 11 hours. We'll be holding up on the updates and PAD's because of the later burn.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. I believe we have the S-IVB in sight. It would appear to be tumbling, and every once in a while, we are getting very bright reflections from it off the star, off the sun.
Roger.
Houston, 8. Are you getting the data from the P23?
Stand by one.
Affirmative, Apollo 8.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We're copying your P23 progress. FAO advises that it looks like you are finishing your first star, and we'll need one more set on the second star, and this 7-hour cut-off isn't that firm, so we would like for you to go ahead and complete the second star if you can.
We're on the last setting of the second star right now.
Okay. Real fine. And we've got a - it's about time for a cryo fan cycle.
Okay. We'll do them one at the time for about 4 minutes on each of them.
Roger.
We've got the cryo fan on in H<sub>2</sub> tank number 1.
Roger, Bill.
Houston, Apollo 8. We've just got finished taking two sets, six sightings on Sirius, and one set on Procyon.
Roger. I understand that's six on Sirius and one on Procyon.
Two sets on Sirius, one set on Procyon.
Roger.
And we're maneuvering now to PTC attitude.
Oh. Roger, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, when you get a chance down in the lower equipment bay, it looks like you're using the floodlights in the dim 2 position, and that one is a time-limited item. We would like for you to do your standard running in the dim 1 position. Over.
Roger. Just turned them off.
Okay. Anytime you have them on, running dim 1 position is preferred to the LEB.
Thank you.
Houston. We have the cryo fan on - the number 1 H<sub>2</sub> tank was on at 07:01. You can give us a hack when you want it - when you're ready for it to be turned off.
Wilco.
Okay, Apollo 8. You can terminate that one and go to the other tank.
Roger.
Okay. O<sub>2</sub> gage number 2 is on.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Are you having any problem on the ground with your COMM?
Negative. You're coming in loud and clear.
Okay. We seem to be breaking lock intermittently up here once in a while.
Roger. We'll keep our eye on it. It sounds good, though.
Okay. Houston, Apollo 8. We've initiated the PTC.
Roger.
Okay. Apollo 8, you can terminate the fans in the hydrogen, and we're ready to start on the oxygen tanks.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, we are through with the dump; you can have the tape recorder back.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are ready to go to the second O<sub>2</sub> tank.
Okay.
And for your information, it's Cleveland 24 to 10, and what we plan to do --
Say again.
That's Cleveland 24 to 10, not over yet.
Thank you.
Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like you can terminate your cryo fans now, and we're going to leave you alone for a while and let you get caught up. Things we have onboard, the high-gain antenna check, COMM mode check that you have listed at 7 hours, we'll put off and do whenever you are ready for it. So that's at your convenience. During the high-gain dump that we performed using a wide band, we were still getting real good data at 36K, which is a little bit further than circuit margins that were predicted for you. And we've got our SPS burn coming up somewhere around 11 hours, and we'll give you more information on that later.
Roger. We're doing the PROGRAM 21 now, determining ground track for LOI that we did not make at 5 hours.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Okay. We just broke lock on S-band high-gain. We're on OMNI B now.
Roger. OMNI B.
Apollo 8, Is that Bravo or Delta?
Dog, Delta.
Roger.
We can't get the PROGRAM 21 to integrate up to LOI; just stalled out around 69 hours and 2 minutes.
Roger. They are watching it.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Do you want us to stop the integration via VERB 96? Over.
That is affirmative; VERB 96.
Roger. Will do.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Do you want us to hold off on this P52 realignment, also?
Yes, that is affirmative, CAP COM. We want to do that a couple of hours when it is related to the maneuver, midcourse.
That is affirmative, Apollo 8. Let's time the maneuver and we will hold off and do that all in normal premaneuver sequence. And - We have got a score here - in the fourth quarter, 31 to 13. And I've got some words on your P21 discrepancy any time you are interested. And I'd like to confirm - -
Go ahead.
Okay. Before I get off on that one, I'd like to confirm that you used the VERB 37 procedure to go to P00.
Roger.
Okay. On P21, the thinking runs that you had a slight error in your state vector at the time you started, and when that was integrated out, it intercepted the lunar surface where it locked up and this is contained in a fairly recent program note.
Okay. Now, we've closed the - the waste vent, so we should see this O<sub>2</sub> come down now.
Okay. Understand you closed the waste vent, and how about the lithium change? Have you done that one?
Roger. That's done.
Okay. Thank you.
EECOM, FLIGHT. Did you copy that?
This conference communication is great. We won't have to have any debriefing.
(Laughter) That's pretty outstanding.
Right.
Did you copy that?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. With the delay in burn, do you mind if we have a urine dump the - before the burn? Will that foul your tracking up?
Okay. Stand by. Let me run that one by.
Apollo 8, Houston. We don't have any objections to going ahead with the urine dump now. And for your information, the waste water dump - our schedule, we plan to put it off until about 11:30, and this will get you up to approximately 90 percent in your waste tank. It's a little higher than normal, but we wanted to put this off until after the burn was completed; and some of the other things that we've got coming up, about 9 hours you have oxygen fuel cell purge; and we've already mentioned the deletion of the star landmark sightings. From 10 to 11 we have put aside for the burn preparations. And a final score is 31 to 20.
Cleveland won over Dallas, huh?
How about that?
Houston, how do the circuit margins on the S-band look as compared to your preflight calculations?
Okay, Apollo 8. It's a little bit early to give you any real numbers on your COMM performance. Looks like it's working as good as predicted, and everything else seems to be doing better, so this may be doing better, too, after we have done our next COMM checks some of these other things will have a better hack on; I can give you a quantitative answer to your question.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
Roger. Sure got a nice view of the earth from here. We can see Baja California and about where San Diego ought to be.
Very good.
I can't see my dad's flagpole out there today, though.
We'll tell the doctors about that.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We dropped off of high gain on the OMNI there for a bit and went to a low bit rate, and we're getting ready to command you back to a high bit rate. Do you want us to keep you posted every time we change tape speeds?
We're not recording now anyway, Houston.
Roger. Understand; but when we go to high bit rate, do you want to be kept informed every time we transfer? We hadn't planned on it.
If we think it we need the recorder, we'll ask you on that deal.
Okay.
Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. How does your tracking look on us?
Fido, FLIGHT.
Apollo 8, tracking still in progress and a little too soon to give you a firm answer on the results, but everything looks nominal so far.
Is it working okay?
Seems to be.
Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Okay. Sometime when it's convenient for you now, I would like to see an oxygen fuel cell purge. And do you have any estimate on when you might be getting around to this COMM test?
Right now we're right in the middle of trying to get something to eat, Ken. We can - I guess we can do the fuel cell purge.
Apollo 8, there's no rush. Just didn't know what you were doing at the time and - Give us a call when you have a free moment; we'll pick up.
We can start the O<sub>2</sub> purge now, if you wish.
Okay. That'd be fine, and I'll keep track of the time for you.
Okay. That'd be good. Now I'll turn on O<sub>2</sub> now on fuel cell 1.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. That's about 2 minutes on your first fuel cell.
Roger. It's up, and number 2 is on now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Houston. Go ahead.
While I'm waiting for my turn at the water gun, I might give some comments on the optics. There seems to be quite a band of light that goes all way across the scanning telescope anywhere in the vicinity of the sun. Just a little while ago we were in the position where I could pick up the moon in the scanning telescope. And then I looked at it in the sextant and the sky - the space around the moon was a very light blue, just about as light blue as we have it back on earth. And it's not black - that sun angle with the moon.
Understand. This light blue was - showed up in the sextant.
That's affirmative. I maneuvered the optics so I could pick up the moon in the sextant, and the - the space around the moon is light blue.
Roger. Can you make any kind of estimate about the proportion of the radius, how far out that seems to extend?
Well, it extends the full length of the sextant. Actually, I could see us coming as we moved across, because the band of light in the scanning telescope cut across where the moon was, and it moved in this area. I believe it's caused by the refractional light inside the optics themselves.
Roger.
Also, I've been occasionally looking out to see if I could see stars at various sun angles, and at this particular altitude, it's very difficult. In the scanning telescope the sun is very bright and the earth is very bright, And if I looked at the earth and try to look for stars, I lose my dark adaptation very quickly.
Roger. Do you have any problems seeing the moon?
No problem seeing the moon. When I looked for the star landmark line of sight, I - It's a very thin crescent, but it was very visible.
Roger. Does the area illuminated in earthshine show up?
Not at this altitude, and that's strange. I thought I could see that. At this altitude, the refraction of the light in the optics themselves, due to the reflection of the sunlight I suspect, or earth's light, completely blanked out the dark side of the moon to this altitude.
How about that.
Maybe we have an atmosphere around the moon.
Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like that ought to terminate the fuel cell purging.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Do you want to get started here around 10 hours? Is that what you said?
Well, what we had planned was to use the 10- to 11-hour period as your preburn preparation just as we would have done normally, and - -
That's fine. We can go ahead and do that.
- - and if you can work in this COMM check before that, it would be desirable, but that's not a constraint.
What do you want in the way of a COMM check, George?
Again, what do you want?
Okay. What we've got here is a couple of DTO COMM checks. We'll be switching around to five different modes, and only one of them will interrupt your activities. In that case, we'll be switching to the uplink backup voice, and that's the one time that you might lose temporary uplink voice COMM. You'll have downlink voice COMM throughout the entire procedure, and it ought to take you, I guess, 10 to 15 minutes MAX, the only requirement being that we should stay on a high-gain antenna.
Why don't we go ahead and start now then?
Okay. That sounds pretty good.
- whenever -
Okay, Apollo 8. Another couple of minutes and we'll be ready to go into our - our COMM check. And, for your information, looks like the signal strength is 3 to 4 dB better than expected on the wide range, on the WIDE BEAM mode, and approximately that gives you 1.4 increase in your range.
Roger. Let's not increase it by 1.4 more, though.
Okay.
Something else you might take a look at: as you go through the PTC, we have some who would like to know if you can see any detectable effect on the windows in the form of their fogging. Particularly, does the sun seem to vary fog intensity or does it increase it or decrease it or make it go in patches or anything like that that you might be able to notice?
The sun doesn't seem to change it much; however, the different incidences of the sun's rays magnify the - the fogging, or at least change it.
Okay, Apollo 8. I'm sorry. Would you say again, please?
The sun doesn't stem to have any effect on the windows themselves, but the different inci - angles of incidence of the sun rays change the relative amount of obscuration caused by the fogging.
Okay.
Okay, Apollo 8. We're ready to go into the COMM check now, and it's your option. We can call out switches and let you position them, or we can command it from the ground. In either event, there will be a couple of switches that you'll have to throw for us.
We'll have to command them, and we'll throw what we have - what you want.
Okay. And I'll keep you posted on what we're doing. The first test is an uplink voice and ranging with full downlink which is essentially what you're doing right now, is to be used for a baseline.
Roger.
Okay. We're starting on test number 1, and if you would verify that S-band NORMAL mode switch is in VOICE.
Roger. We're in VOICE.
Okay.
... Charlie.
And the up-telemetry DATA to DATA.
Roger. DATA.
Okay. And up-telemetry COMMAND to NORMAL.
Normal.
Roger. How about high-gain antenna track to AUTO?
We're on OMNI D now; we've got to wait till we get around the other way.
Okay. What's your estimate?
We're at 15 minutes from it.
Okay.
Maybe we'd better hold the COMM check till after the midcourse, because we'd better get fired here at 10 if we want to burn at 9.
That's affirm. We're viewing that right now.
... means we're on two vertical level.
Okay, Apollo 8. We're postponing the COMM test until after the burn.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Are you ready to go - for us to go through with the P52 now?
That's negative, Apollo 8. We would like to update things first, and we're going to give you a LM state vector and then an external ΔV|DELTA-V.
Roger.
And with P00 in ACCEPT while we'll go ahead and work on that.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We've got your PAD's. We're ready to read up to you, And we're standing by to uplink your state vector and external ΔV|DELTA-V whenever you're ready to give us ACCEPT.
Roger. Just stand by one, and we will get the PAD from you.
And we will put in - TM in ACCEPT now - at this time.
Roger.
We're ready to copy the PAD.
Okay, Apollo 8. I didn't copy that last one. We are sending you state vector up now.
Roger. We say we are ready to copy the PAD.
Okay. The first PAD will be a maneuver PAD, MCC one, and this will be an SPS/G&N beginning with the weight, 63295 minus 163 plus 129 010:59:58.30 plus 001 36 minus 00 045 plus 002 02 345 188 343 999 99 plus 016 85 002 48 002 001 86 23 2013 164 012 up 276, left 04, November Alfa for the remainder of that column. In the comments: north stars; 068 097 356, a no ullage start, and a single bank burn on bank Alfa. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. MCC 1 maneuvers: SPS/G&N 63295 minus 163 plus 129 010:59:58.30 plus 00136 minus 00045 plus 00202 345 188 343 all 9's plus 01685 000248 002 00186 23 2013 164 012, up 27-6, left 04 November Alfa for the remainder. North set stars, roll 068, pitch 097, yaw 356, no ullage single bank - bank Alfa.
Roger, Apollo 8. That's correct. And I have a TLI plus - 11 PAD for you.
Roger. Go ahead.
Houston, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Roger, Apollo 8. Loud and clear now. Are you ready to copy?
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay. This is a TLI plus 11, SPS/G&N. This assumes a midcourse correction number 1: 631 40 minus 163, plus 129 013:56:48.97, minus 005, 99, plus 00 00 0, plus 47016, 177 143 000 November Alfa, plus 001 97 47 020 5 51 468 18 12 12 83 257 023, up 263, left 17, plus 11 95, minus 165 00 126 83 356 08 050:47:05, north stars; 068 097 356, no ullage. For the fast return P37 ΔV|DELTA-V, 7900 for the Indian Ocean, high speed procedure not required for the MS. This assumes midcourse correction 1. Over.
Stand by.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. To the readback. Are you ready?
Go ahead.
TLI plus 11 SPS/G&N 63140, minus 163, plus 129 13:56:48.97, minus 00599, plus 00000. And I believe it's plus 47016.
Affirmative.
177 143 000 NA, plus 00197, 47020 551 46818 12 128.3 257 023, up 263, left 17, plus 1195, minus 16500, plus 126 23 35608 050:47:05, the north set, roll 68, pitch 97, yaw 356, no ullage, P37 high speed, 7900 Indian Ocean, and high speed procedures for the MS are not required; assumed MCC 1.
Roger, Apollo 8. Two corrections on the GETI. The hour's 013. Range to go EMS.
013.
Roger. Copy that and the rings to go in the EMS 126 83. Over.
12683.
That's correct.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. Be advised that we doubted that it would be possible to use the stars to get our backup alignment. We haven't been able to see any stars through the scanning telescope yet.
Roger.
Okay. And another comment for you, Apollo 8; like for you to use VERB 37 to select P00 and then wait for your computer activity light to go off prior to unzap of the LM NAV to CSM SLA.
Roger. You ready for us to do that now?
That's affirm.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Okay. Now we'll go ahead and start back towards the flight plan around 8 hours here of P52, right?
That's affirm.
Well, we - we have transferred - wait - we've transferred the state vector to the LM SLA already before we did a 52. So we're going to do the 52 now.
Okay, Apollo 8. That's good procedure and -
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Will you check your up-telemetry switch to BLOCK, please?
Thank you. It's in BLOCK.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. We've got a telescope alignment if you'd like to give it a try. Your sextant star is still good, but if you had problems with that, folks have worked out that if you look through the telescope at 10:35, we have a shaft and trunnion that should point you at the center of the earth, if you would like to give that one a try.
Okay.
Okay. At 10:35, the shaft angle 006.2, trunnion 18.9. Over.
Roger. 10:35: shaft 006.2, trunnion 18.9.
That's affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like to get a fan - a cryo fan cycle in here before the burn. About 1 minute on each should be fine.
Roger. I've already given 2 minutes on H<sub>2</sub> 1 and 2 and O<sub>2</sub> 1, and I've just started O<sub>2</sub> 2.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to dump your tape prior to the burn.
Roger. It's only been running here about 15 minutes.
Okay, Apollo 8. That's - that's correct. You're on high bit rate, and we're afraid you may run out before the burn, so we'd like to dump it, and give it back to you with a full load before the burn.
Roger. And give us a comment on the voice quality.
Wilco.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. We plan to stop charging battery B about another 5 minutes. You concur?
That's affirmative.
Okay. You might just remind us.
Wilco.
Apollo 8.
This is 8. Go ahead.
Go ahead, Houston. You were cut out.
Okay, Apollo 8. All your systems are GO, and we were about to tell you you can go ahead and terminate the battery charge, and you beat us to the punch.
I read your mind, and it's showing 37 volts right now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. If you'll go high bit rate, we'll give you a tape recorder back to your command.
Apollo 8, Houston. If you'll put your high bit rate on, we'll give you a tape recorder back.
Roger.
Houston, did you give us a tape back? Over.
Affirmative, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8's COMMAND RESET to get tape motion, we're now in NORMAL.
Roger.
Apollo 8, stand by for a mark at 1 minute.
Roger. Apollo 8 standing by.
Ten seconds.
Five seconds.
2, 1 -
MARK.
One minute.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. The burn time was on time - about 2 seconds; we have residual 4.4 X. We burned it out to 0.2. Attitudes are nominal. The ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> before the residuals were taken out was a minus 2.4. I have transferred the state vector to the LM's slot in VERB 66.
Roger. Copy 4.4 for X and 2.4 on Z. And negative residual on Y prior to the trim. Is that affirm?
That's affirmative, and we took out the 4.4 residual down to 0.2.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you want us to start charging battery A, now?
Standby.
Apollo 8. Let's go back to battery Bravo, and we'll finish that one off before we start in on Alfa.
Roger. Battery Bravo.
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you want us to maneuver to any particular attitude for a water dump, or do you want us to go to PTC attitude?
Okay. Let's go PTC.
And give us the angles, please.
Okay, Apollo 8. Let's do the same angles we had before: that's pitch 242 and yaw 20 on the PTC attitude.
242, yaw 20. Roger.
Houston, we're preparing to dump our waste water now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, 8.
We noticed on our system test battery vent pressure that when we opened the battery vent valve, we get an immediate drop-off to pressure which nulls out at about two-tenths of 2 - to three-tenths of a volt. And we think this is zero at the battery manifold. Do you concur?
Okay. Stand by. ... stand by one, and let's check it out.
Apollo 8, I cut you out there. What did you say on the last one?
It looks like probably that zero psi corresponds to about three-tenths of a volt on the test meter. We've had it happen a couple of times, where the pressure would drop rapidly to this setting, as if it were zero. Over.
Roger. We'll look at our data here and let you know what we see. Are you going ahead with the water dump now?
Roger. We'd - we're pausing here on the water dump, though, just to verify that the battery vent - the line is clear as indicated by a battery vent pressure of zero.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Number one on the list of things is that the flight plan shows CDR should hit the sack. Number two, kind of a summary of your burn. All your SPS and systems look GO. The trajectory shows that you have a CPA with a mode of 69.67 miles and the time of pericynthion is 69 plus 10. You do have a capture on a good free return. It's a little bit early to completely evaluate the trajectory for corridor control. You'll have no update to the TLI plus 11 block data. After looking through the CAL curves, it looks like the battery-vent pressure is actually zero at 0.2 to 0.3 volts, so that - we agree with you there, and you can go ahead with the water dump. We still have the COMM check to do whenever we get ourselves in a good high gain look angle and whenever it's convenient for you. Over.
Thank you very much. That was a very fine resume you sent in. We're right now in the process of trying to dump out the water and the UCDA's and so on and so on. So we'll get with you on the high gain as soon as we can.
Okay. Good burn.
Houston, what do you want to dump the waste tank down to?
Apollo 8, I would like you to dump the waste tank to 25 percent.
Okay.
Hey, we're dumping now, Houston.
Okay. Thank you.
We finally got some stars to see.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Do you folks have your WATER QUANTITY switch in the POTABLE or the WASTE WATER TANK position now?
We're in the WASTE TANK position now, and we're dumping UCDA's first, Houston.
Okay. We weren't watching any waste quantity decrease, and it looked like the nozzle temps indicated that something was going on, and we were trying to dope out what was going on.
Well, there's a lot of stuff going out I'll tell you. How do nozzle temps look?
Oh, about 81.
Okay. We'll keep on going then.
Okay, Houston. We're going to dump the waste tank on down to about 25 percent.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you copy?
Affirmative, Apollo 8.
Okay. Tell Zeke Thomas to wake up and keep an eye on the waste tank servicing.
It'll take a minute to think of something appropriate.
You're slowing down.
So are you guys.
How are the nozzle temperatures looking, Houston?
Stand by.
Man, you're looking pretty small down there now, Houston.
We're carrying a big stick, though.
Just barely make out Clear Lake.
Your nozzle temperatures have dropped from about 94 to around 66.
Okay. I'm showing just a little bit above 50 percent here, and we'll keep on going, and if it looks too cold, give us a call.
Okay. We'll do that.
Houston, we had a momentary O<sub>2</sub> high flow, but we think it's due to all the purging of the water lines we're doing here in the cabin.
Roger. We concur.
Apollo 8, Houston. We show you down to 25 percent of your waste water.
Okay. I'm just about 28, Houston. Stand by just a bit.
Okay. Waste dump stopped and then purge again.
Understand. Roger. Waste dump stopped.
Roger.
Houston, we're on a high gain, and it might be a good time to try your COMM check.
Apollo 8, we're going to go ahead and crank up to a COMM test now, and we will be a little bit late on your update for 12 hours.
Okay.
Do you still want our - have us command as much as we can on the ground, or would you like to move the switches yourself?
Oh, you can have the fun of doing it.
Sounds like you're dragging there.
... you suggest a ... We're using 1/250 on at f:11 on CEX and CMAX for earth shots. Do you verify? Over.
Okay. You got going before I got my pencil up. How about saying it again?
f:11 and 1/250 for CEX 16mm and C 70mm.
Okay. Thank you.
How about running in by the back room boys. My light meter doesn't seem to be helping out too much.
Okay.
Okay, Apollo 8. We're starting in - setting up for our first COMM test. This is going to be an uplink voice, ranging, and full downlink, which is not anything really different than what you have on board. I would like for you to verify that the S-band NORMAL MODE VOICE switch is in VOICE.
Roger. VOICE.
Okay. And the up-telemetry DATA to DATA.
Roger. DATA.
Up-telemetry COMMAND in NORMAL.
Roger. NORMAL.
High-gain antenna to AUTO TRACK.
Correction. That's -
AUTO.
We're in AUTO WIDE BEAM, and you can go ahead and dump the tape.
Okay. I'd like for you to go to NARROW BEAM.
Okay. Going to NARROW BEAM now.
Roger.
And I'll give you a call when we get ready to work on the tape.
Okay. We're still in PTC, so you're only going to have it for about 10 or 15 minutes.
Okay. We've had some problems with our displays, and I think they're straightened out now, but you may have to keep us advised if we run out of limits in case we display again.
Roger.
Say, while we're standing by here, Apollo 8, the service module quantities that we had listed - we're going to try to update them, if you want to call out your quantities. Have you checked them with your charts?
Negative. I haven't gotten around to that. Stand by.
Okay. There's no hurry on that. Just wondered if you had done it; we will check it against what we've got on our norma-gram.
I'm showing a SPS helium pressure, about 3570, indicated on board.
Roger.
And fuel LOX tank pressures are 177 and 176, respectively.
Okay.
N<sub>2</sub> A is 2400, B 2500.
Okay.
Okay. And our back room tells you that you've got the right F stop.
Okay. Then we'll keep using it.
This PTC attitude really isn't the greatest for taking pictures of the earth.
Roger.
Or of the moon.
Apollo 8, kinda stand by for a burst of noise as we change configurations on the ground. We're going into test 1; You'll still have up and downlink, and we'll be in this mode for 2 minutes, but you may hear some burst of noise as we change.
Roger.
Okay, Apollo 8. We're in the middle of our first test, and how about giving me a voice check.
Roger, Houston. This is Apollo 8. One, two, three, four, five, five, four, three, two, one. Apollo 8, out.
Roger. And read you loud and clear. This COMM is unbelievably good.
Good.
Okay, Apollo 8. We've finished the first test, and we're now going to change the uplink mode to UPLINK COMMAND AND RANGING, and we'll be going without upvoice. We'll be in this mode for 2-1/2 minutes and will be sending a test messages. It'll have no effect on either your computer or your panel switch configuration. What you might see will be the S-band noise that's associated with the break lock. However, you should still have a good signal on your power meter. This is not a loss of signal, but rather just a loss of the voice modulation, and I'll do you a mark just before we do that so that you can turn your S-band volume down if you so desire, and we'll be back up in this mode that we're in now in 2-1/2 minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're about to disable the voice modulation on uplink, and we'll be back up no later than 12:31.
Apollo 8, Houston. Voice check.
Read you five-by, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear and am with you. Completed our second test.
Okay.
Okay. Our next test will be a test of the uplink voice and ranging with downlink voice and ranging and on low bit rate, so we'll be changing bit rate on you, and we'll be making a voice check in the middle.
Okay. You've about had it on the high gain. You might try to get it in, but it's going to hit the scan limit at any second.
Okay, Apollo 8. Looks like we'll get our information before we lose the high gain.
Okay. We'll just leave it go.
Roger.
They got the scan limit. We'll let it go, Houston, until it breaks lock.
Okay, Apollo 8. Go ahead and switch to the OMNI.
How're you doing with your test?
Okay. We've got three-fifths of the test. We'll have to pick up the rest next time we get a look at high gain.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Reading on P21 at 269 10 indicates a parallel of about 67.4 miles. I guess we can carry her.
You guys are getting pretty good.
That's a lot better than our first answer.
We don't care if we're right, just so MPAD is right.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. I'd like to ask a question about this TLI plus 11 maneuver that we copied. In the remarks, you put P37, ΔV|DELTA-V 7900. Is this the ΔV|DELTA-V that we would use with P37?
Okay. That's the option that you use with minimum time.
Roger. What I'd like to do is check on our P37 with your TLI maneuver update.
Okay, Apollo 8. We'd like to make sure that we don't have a misunderstanding that this 7900 feet per second is the ΔV|DELTA-V. It's not associated with the high speed per feet work around procedure. This is just a standard P37 ΔV|DELTA-V.
Roger. But was that the ΔV|DELTA-V that you used to give us the TLI plus 11? Okay.
Okay. That's not the one that the maneuver PAD was based on. That's the number you put in for the minimum time.
Roger. Understand.
Okay. Sounds like a good idea if you want to go ahead and check out the 37. And we're standing by to work on COMM as soon as that high gain is available.
Roger.
Okay. Houston, you got the high gain.
Houston, do you read? Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. High gain yours.
Okay. And if you're ready, we are. We'll go right ahead with our COMM checks.
Go ahead.
We're starting in now on our fourth test. Like for you to put your TELEMETRY INPUT switch to PCM HIGH.
It's in HIGH.
Okay. And now we're going to switch uplink to the upvoice backup for about 2 minutes, and it may take a couple of seconds when you hear the upvoice lost. So you can place your up-telemetry switch to upvoice backup, and in the event that all of this doesn't work out too well, I'm reading 12:47 on my clock now, and let's meet back in our present configuration no later than 12:50.
Roger. On upvoice backup.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
That's pretty good. That's upvoice backup, and will you confirm that you're in NARROW BEAM on high gain?
Roger. NARROW BEAM.
Okay. Thank you. We're going to continue tracking and watching high-gain antenna for a couple of minutes. Then I'll give you a call when we're ready to go back.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have completed this test. We'll be switching back to full uplink. When you hear the noise associated with the loss of modulation, you can go back from the up-telemetry switch to DATA.
Thank you.
All the way.
Okay. Loud and clear.
How's everything looking down there?
Real fine. We've just got one to go here if you'll put your telemetry input PCM switch to LOW.
Roger. Go in LOW.
Okay. We'll be in that configuration for about 2 minutes, and then we'll be completed with the COMM test.
Roger.
I have some service module RCS quantities if you would like to take them sometime and check them against your onboard calculations.
Stand by.
Roger. Ready to copy. Could you give quad A, B, C, and D in that order?
Okay. Will do. And I'll give you weights in pounds and percentages. Quad A 231 for 76 percent.
Roger. Stand by. What time is that for?
Oh, 12 plus 15.
Okay. Got it.
Okay. Quad Bravo 251, 82 percent. Quad Charlie 240, 79 percent.
Slow down.
Quad Delta 245, 81 percent. P and C advises that these numbers are still good even though it is a 12:15 time. And we are completed with the COMM test. You can take your high-gain antenna and go back to MEDIUM.
Roger. MEDIUM.
Apollo 8, we would like to dump your tape again, if you are not using it. And the reason we want to do this is we have some - we didn't completely get dumped before the burn. We would like to get that and get the rest of the burn data. There is no hurry on it. We can do it whenever it is convenient for you.
You got it.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Do you call?
Negative, negative. Negative, Houston.
Okay. Thank you. Say, we're curious about what you did with your Mae West?
We thought we might bleed the CO<sub>2</sub> out into the vacuum connector here in our next water dump. We forgot it the last time. Did you copy?
Roger, Doesn't seem like there is any problem with going ahead and dumping it in the cockpit if you like.
It is CO<sub>2</sub>, isn't it?
That's affirm.
Apollo 8, Houston. We asked it again, and it looks like no problems at all with going ahead and bleeding it down in the cockpit. And then if you need it again on entry or after entry, well, we can blow it up with oral tube.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 8. Read you loud and clear. How us?
Okay. Loud and clear. Didn't get you there for a while.
We have been reading you all along, Houston.
Roger. Did you attempt to transmit, or were you just not getting through?
Roger. We attempted to transmit, and it sounded like you had a stuck mike there for a little while.
Okay. That shouldn't make any difference to us on that Duplex mode. Okay. What I was calling for, Apollo 8 - we have got a maneuver PAD that is TLI plus 25. I would like to read up to you when you are ready for it.
Go ahead, Houston. TLI plus 25.
Okay. TLI plus 25, and this will be an SPS/G&N. 63087, minus 162, plus 129 027:56:29.64, minus 001 63, plus 00001, plus 527 59 177 137 001, November Alfa, plus 00201 527 59 623 525 43 14 2347 337 023 up 195 left 17, plus 11 45, minus 165 00 127 80 358 90 074:38:16, north stars 068 097 356, no ullage. For the fast return P37 ΔV|DELTA-V, 7900 to the Indian ocean. High-speed procedures are not required. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Maneuver PAD as follows. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear.
Roger. TLI plus 25, SPS/G&N 63087, minus 162 plus 129 027:56:29.64, minus 00163, plus 00001, plus 52759 177 137 001, not applicable, plus 00201 52759 623 52543 14 2347 337 023 up 195 left 1.7, plus 1145, minus 16500 12780 35890 074:38:16. North set 068 097 356, no ullage, P37 fast return of 7 - 700 and 7900 ΔV|DELTA-V Indian Ocean. High speed not required.
That's correct, Apollo 8. And we'll have a couple more things for you before too long. We're working on a flyby PAD at this time. And we're going to be talking some more to you about the problem of looking at stars in the sextant and telescope. And what we'd like to do as soon as the black team comes on the MOKR, while we have two teams here, we would like to get a rehash from you on exactly what you see and what you don't see and under what conditions, and see if we can define it so that everyone here understands what you've been telling us. And if you have any comments concerning the timeline - knowing that we got off our timeline before the burn - if you have any comments about that method of getting back on schedule, we'd like to hear those, too.
Roger. We have one request. CDR would like to get clearance to take a Seconal.
Okay, Apollo. That's a GO.
Roger. And, Houston, this is 8. We might go over our future NAV sighting schedule if it's going to be revised at all.
Okay, Apollo 8. No planned revisions.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Have your flyby PAD now so I can give that to you whenever you're ready for it.
Stand by. Ready to copy.
Apollo 8. Here we go on a flyby maneuver PAD. This will be an SPS/G&N 63087, minus 162, plus 129 060:59:48.04, plus 009 62, plus 005 68, minus 020 77 000 000 000, November Alfa, plus 00202 02359 022 02282 03 0399 314 013 up 048 right 37, plus 1418, minus 16500 129 04 361 60 146:29:11. North stars 323 090 056, no ullage. Remarks: number one, this requires realignment to preferred REFSMMAT. Two, this will raise the perilune to 550 nautical miles. Over.
Roger. Read back.
Go ahead.
Flyby SPS/G&N 63087, minus 162, plus 129 060:59:48.04, plus 009 62, plus 00568, minus 02077, 000 000 000, NA. Are you with me so far?
Keep going.
Plus 00202 02359 022 02282 03 0399 314 013 up 048 right 37, plus 1418, minus 16500 129 04 361 60 146:29:11, north 323 090 056, no ullage. Realign for preferred REFSMMAT at perigee is 50.
That's a perilune to 550.
Understand. 550.
That's affirm, and that's perilune.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We've completed the dump and the tape recorder is yours, and we listened to the call data voice playback, and you've been given a GO for your first test in creative writing.
Roger. Are we in low bit rate now?
That's negative. You're in high bit, and you understand that it's your tape recorder?
Roger. Are you going to stay in high bit all along, or are you going to be back to low here soon not that it matters much to us, really.
Okay. We plan to stay in high bit rate. We were going to ask you if it made my difference, and you read our minds. That's pretty good for 63K.
Roger. That's an altitude record for mind reading.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Onboard calculations indicate that at 13 hours 30 minutes GET we are not 64 200 miles above the earth. That's using alternate slide rule.
We've got 63 855.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We're going to try to keep the conversation down here for a while so the CDR can go to sleep.
Okay. We would like to get some comments from you before you sign off concerning the telescope, sextant, and verification that you have done something with the CO<sub>2</sub> in your Mae West and comment on the window status.
Roger. Is it a requirement that we do something with the CO<sub>2</sub> at this time? Over.
No. That is negative.
Roger. We have maintained the same condition. We have left it as it was, and it will take care of it later.
Okay.
Let me at this time go over the comments about the navigation as I see it so far.
Go.
In the beginning, the operation with the S-IVB precluded immediate starting up of our sightings as we had scheduled since we had another evasive maneuver. The dumping of the S-IVB caused a tremendous amount of - of pseudo stars in the area which made an optics calibration practically impossible. The method which we had worked out did not seem to work too well. The method which I finally used was to go into P23, go to Sirius, which was our brightest star, get the shaft and trunnion, and then fly the spacecraft up to Sirius to use that for the optics CAL, which we did at a later time. With regards to light scatter, it appears that at almost any attitude during our passive thermal control, we are receiving light scattering in the scanning telescope. It takes the form mostly of a wide band of light right across the center of the scope about 10 degrees either direction of zero. It is very difficult to see stars in this area. The realignments have been good. I have been able to pick up the star in the sextant to do the alignment, but I was not able to identify the star which we used in such cases as Regor or Menkent in the scanning telescope. The first star sighting which I took of the earth showed a very indistinct horizon. But there did appear to be a very - or somewhat sharp line between what appeared to be the earth's horizon and the atmosphere. The landmark line-of-sight filter appeared to help out this horizon definition. There is a very hazy and indistinct horizon through - between the space and the top of the atmosphere itself, and this is a very difficult one to use. As I said before, at times, looking at the moon with the Sun in the near vicinity, the area around the moon, the space around the moon is not dark, but is a light - appears as a light blue. And this is also the same case as looking into the sextant during alignments with the star - with the sun in somewhat vicinity of the optics. However, I have no difficulty in finding these stars in the sextant. I also had no difficulty in spotting the stars I used, such as Sirius, Procyon, or Canopus against the earth during our star-horizon measurements. I can see all three of those stars against the earth background. I believe it will be very difficult to do a backup GDC alignment using the north set stars, since Navi is not too bright of a star. I was able to spot star constellations in the scanning telescope if they were very bright and well known, such as Cetus and Orion, stars of this nature. I was not able to perceive other constellations. That's about the only comments I have at this time. Over.
Okay. Fine; thank you very much.
We are going to do - Houston - future maneuvers for P53 in a lower - slower mode of AUTO maneuver. Essentially, we are going to load the DAP with 11101 to save fuel.
Roger. That will be a 11101 DAP load.
Roger. We are going to try to save fuel that way.
Good show.
With respect to the window, Houston: the windows 1 and 5 have moderate haze on them. Satisfactory for visual observation, but possibly not for photography. Windows 2 and 4 are clear. Window 3 is almost opaque. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
And how is battery B looking to you?
Apollo 8, Houston. It looks like it may take another 6 hours on this battery B charge. It turns out that the charge rate is less than what we are getting on our ground curves, but it is still above the Apollo 7 curves, and it looks like it is going along now in good shape. And I would like to have verification that the timeline leading up to the midcourse correction was satisfactory from your point of view.
Roger. Seemed quite satisfactory.
Okay. Thank you. And we will stay off the loop until you give us a call.
Roger. You don't bother us, but our replies make a lot of noise.
Okay.
Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're very weak. You got the proper OMNI?
Houston. Apollo. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Bill. Go ahead.
Okay. I'm just wondering how your tracking's doing.
Okay. We're still tracking you. We don't have any firm solutions, yet.
Okay. Things looking nominal up here. How about down there?
Okay. The systems basically look good, Bill. We're going to be coming up on a cryo fan cycle period in another few minutes, and you can go ahead and do that when you get ready.
Okay.
And I guess we picked up some suspicions about the fuel cell 2 radiator out temp. How does that compare on board?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, you called?
Roger. We're showing RAD OUT temp on fuel cell 2 would be about 90 degrees, and on 1 and 3 it would be slightly lower - maybe 75 or 80 degrees. About an hour ago you wondered about fuel cells performance; it looks like 1 and 2 are lower in performance than 3. Over.
Roger. We show the same numbers on your outlet temperatures and thought that was a sensor failure. We've been watching the thing and we'll keep you advised of anything we see.
Okay.
And on the performance, you're right - they are not quite the same, 1 and 2 are a little bit lower but all of these are sitting within the ballpark.
Roger. Fuel cell 1 has shown slightly a proportionately higher H<sub>2</sub> flow than O<sub>2</sub> flow all day long.
Okay.
I'm showing 0.062 H<sub>2</sub> and 0.48 O<sub>2</sub>.
Roger. We'll take some CAL curves on those.
Okay. These things look reasonable to me and we'll keep looking at them. Our RAD OUT shows about 0.43 as opposed to your 0.48 on the oxygen, and we'll keep an eye on the CAL curves and just sort of watch it for you.
Okay. Thank you.
If you'd like to set up some kind of a COMM check or specified time like every 30 minutes or so on these quiet periods, that would be okay with us. Might help to let us know that we're still in business.
All right. Just give me a call every now and then.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Sometime when it's convenient, get your BIOMED switch over to the right, and you don't need to answer; just pass it up to you.
Apollo 8, Houston. How about a COMM check, and did you get that fuel cell purge - correction, the cryo fans ON?
Roger. We've had the cryo fans ON each for about 3 or 4 minutes.
Okay. Real good. We weren't real sure that's what we were watching, and you're coming through loud and clear.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Okay, Jim. Got an update here to the flight plan. You've got the 16:55 star visibility check, and what we've got on that looks like Navi is still our star, and the numbers associated with that are roll 102.6, pitch 328.9, yaw 346.3. That gives you a shaft and trunnion of zero. And if you think you can - if you think you can do something with this, why we would like to go ahead and give it a try and see if we can either verify it or maybe we'll both learn something if we verify it if you can do it with Navi.
Roger. Standby one.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We'll maneuver at this present time and try to pick up that attitude and get Navi, although I think it's a waste of time, but we will give it a try.
Roger. Standing by for results.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We're at that attitude right now and looking through the scanning telescope. I can barely see any stars at all, and every time that the thruster will fire, you know, just completely blanks out my vision.
Roger, 8. Understand.
Now the attitude is good, Houston, as far as not having glare on the optics, and it might be a certain amount of data adaptation is required here.
8, Houston. Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. I've got a new PTC attitude for you when you finish P23. Give you a better look at the earth. Over.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay. Pitch 224, yaw 20.
New PTC is pitch 224, yaw 20.
Affirm.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We are taking our time going to this new P23 attitude; going to Navi is quite a ways away from the attitude we need for P23. I have a correction to make on 20 - on Navi after getting dark adapted; you can pick out Cassiopeia and you can pick out Navi itself. It is difficult to see what stars are around. We still have quite a bit of particles that are floating with the spacecraft, especially when we move the optics and shaft. It seems to throw off a lot of particles.
Roger. We copy that. What's your spacecraft lighting situation inside now?
We have the center window - the round window covered, and we have - the other windows are opened.
Roger, 8. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. While you're maneuvering for your P23, we have an update for DELTA-H for you if you're ready to copy.
Roger. Stand by.
Roger, Houston. You say you have a DELTA-H update for us? Just what do you mean?
Roger. DELTA horizon update.
Roger. Go ahead.
This is as a result of your P23 calibration; the update follows: VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER 1354, ENTER all balls, ENTER 214 50 ENTER; comment: continue to mark on the horizon destination that you've used previously. Your marks are looking very good.
Roger. DELTA-H update as follows: VERB 24, NOUN 01, ENTER 1354, ENTER all zeros, ENTER 214 50 ENTER. Understand those are two octal numbers.
That's affirmative; both octal.
Roger. When do we get the maneuvers here? I'll go out on 23, and I'll put these in; then I'll continue.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. There's no requirement for you to leave P23; you can enter those right now if you want to.
Roger.
Houston, are we in low bit rate now?
Apollo 8, Houston. You're in high bit rate.
Roger. We'd like to record you this P23 stuff.
Okay.
How about commanding low bit rate record FORWARD.
Roger. Low bit rate, record FORWARD.
All right, Houston. Have you sent those commands yet?
Apollo 8, Houston. They have been sent.
All right, Roger. Thank you. I am on the other side, too lazy to go over and get it.
Apollo 8, Houston, We'd like to go back to high bit rate in order to get this P23 data recorded. Over.
Our checklist says low bit rate, Houston. If you want high, you can have it.
Roger. We're going high bit rate.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Do you want us to turn off your DSE for you? It's probably about half full. We're getting good high bit rate down.
Do you want to get the rest of this data?
We're getting good high bit rate down.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. And, also, we're - your state vector is now based on about 5 hours of tracking. We have you on a pericynthian of 69.7 miles with a free return. Your entry flight path angle looks like about minus 14. You will need only a few feet per second to get you back on a nominal entry angle.
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you get the words on the state vector?
Houston, did you read? Apollo 8. We got a lot of noise.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, this is Houston reading you fairly weak. I'll repeat the state vector information. Your state vector is now based on 5 hours, more than 5 hours of tracking. We show you on a pericynthian of 69.7 miles with a free return with entry path flight angle of minus 14 degrees. Will only need a few feet per second at the lunar distance to get you back on a nominal entry angle. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go. Reading you weak, but clear.
Roger. Our sighting schedule is complete, and I'm maneuvering to PTC attitude.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. I'm at the PTC maneuver now. Like a distance status from you - how the battery looks and how the fuel cells look and et cetera. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We figure battery B will be charged in about 2 to 3 hours. All your systems look GO; your RCS usage so far is about 60 pounds, six-zero pounds over nominal. Over.
Roger. How about fuel cell 2; is that looking all right now?
Roger. Fuel cells are all looking good.
Okay. We're going to have two of us hit the hay now and one man minding the store so you might have everybody keep an extra sharp eye on ...
Roger, Bill. You think you're going to be able to sleep okay?
Yes. I think we kinda warmed up to a good sleep here by now.
Houston. Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Onboard navigation indicates a pericynthian altitude of 38.4 miles.
Understand; 38.4 miles.
That's affirmative. It's on the DSKY right now, if you're reading it.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Be advised your downlink now is getting very noisy.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with some comments on navigation.
Go ahead, Houston.
Good morning, Frank. Apollo 8, this is Houston. We're wondering about your GDC backup align; we'd like your opinion on the possibility of doing this align using Sirius and Rigel rather than Navi, as it's in the north set at this time. Over.
Stand by one.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We concur. Sirius and Rigel would be two stars that would be much better than Navi and Polaris. However, I did Cassiopeia after I became adapted, but I'm afraid that the time required to do that type of alignment would be extensive if we ever had to go to that alignment.
Roger, Jim. We understand. We'll go ahead and work in that direction, and we'll quit bothering you. Good night.
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. At 19 GET, we're due for another cycle through on the cryo fans. Over.
Roger.
Roger. Give us a call when you're complete.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Give me a call when it is time to quit charging the battery, will you? I can't watch it very well over there.
Wilco.
And I'm starting with the fans now.
Roger. Copy.
Hydrogen 1 first.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. We cycled through the fans 2 minutes each, and we'll stand by for the call for battery charges.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. The battery charge will be complete around 21 hours.
Okay. Just give me a call.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Houston. Crew status report here. We're behind on water and food, and we don't seem to have too much of an appetite. We're trying to stay up with the water, but the food is - not that there's anything wrong with the food, but we're just not very hungry.
Roger. Understand, Frank.
The CDR got 5 hours of fitful sleep and rest, and the other two people are trying to sleep now.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. At 21 hours, we'd like you to terminate the battery B charge and start battery A charge and then begin an O<sub>2</sub> purge. Over.
Roger. Understand; terminate battery B, start battery A, and an O<sub>2</sub> purge.
Roger. O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. We are now charging battery A, and say again about the purge.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Copy your battery charge setup; now begin a fuel cell O<sub>2</sub> purge. Over.
Fuel cell O<sub>2</sub> purge. Roger.
Houston, the fuel cells are all purged.
Roger, Frank.
How's the tracking going, Jerry?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8. Houston.
How's the tracking looking?
It's looking good, Frank. We just took in another batch of data, and we are processing it. It looks initially like we won't even need a midcourse number 2. As soon as we process this data, we will have some confirmation for you. It should take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes to finish the job.
Thank you.
Apollo 8. Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are showing your pericynthian 64 nautical miles. Your next midcourse at 28 will be less than 1 foot per second. We will have a firm confirmation on this in about 2 hours.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
How do you read?
Reading you loud and clear, Frank. Good morning. How are you doing?
Just fine. We just broke lock for a minute, and I wondered why.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Your break lock is due to the fact we switched our antennas over from Honeysuckle to Madrid. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. We would like to bring you up to date on your trajectory. This midcourse coming up at 28 hours GET turns out to be very small, 0.7 feet per second, and we would like not to do it. Our data is looking extremely good and extrapolating it forward; it shows the midcourse number 4 at LOI minus 8 hours would be about 4 feet per second. In the meantime, the free return trajectory is looking very good with a water splash point off the coast of Africa. So it looks like you are right down the old center line, and we propose not to do the next midcourse. Over.
Fine with us.
Okay. And in regard to your timeline here, we suggest that you let Bill and Jim sleep for an extra period of time and don't wake them up until 26:30 GET, and that would cause deletion of P52 and P23 at 26 hours GET. Over.
Roger. Understand. Delete P52 and P23.
Affirmative. Delete those at 26 hours, wake the other two guys up at 26:30 at which time they can eat, and then chlorinate the water supply after they have eaten.
Roger.
That would put us back on our nominal flight plan at 28 hours GET. Over.
Roger.
How's all that grab you?
Fine.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston, Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, we're switching antennas again at 23:40 GET. You can expect a momentary break lock, and also we would like to bring you up to date on the passive thermal control. We expect to keep the same PTC attitude until 28 hours GET. Over.
Fine; thank you. How is the thermal control working?
Working good, Frank. I can give you some details if you want it.
Go ahead.
I am all ears, Houston. Go ahead with the details.
Okay. Stand by one until we switch our antennas, Frank. We'll be right with you.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
On your PTC, quads A, C, and D seem to be just about identical. Quad B is running slightly cooler, but only very slightly so. The temperature readouts in all respects are normal, so apparently the PTC is working well from a thermal viewpoint. And as far as the fuel consumption goes, it's minimal, just about like we expected. Have you got any comments about PTC? How does it seem to you?
Seems fine. Seems to be working all right, just like you said. I was just wondering how the readouts from the SPS were, too.
Apollo 8, Houston. The SPS temperature is normal. If anything, it's slightly warmer than we expected, so you are in real good shape in that respect.
Thank you.
Frank, the PU valve temperature is running about 72 degrees, which is better control than we got here in this room.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. It is time to do a cryo fan cycle, Frank, on all four fans, a short burst from each of them as you did before.
Understand, 2 minutes each on all cryo fans.
Roger.
Cryo fans OFF and cycled, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead. Over.
I said the cryo fans are OFF and completed the cycle.
Okay. Thank you, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Just a COMM check, Frank. Do you read me all right?
Loud and clear.
Same here.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go.
How've you been reading our tape dumps?
Stand by one, Frank. We noticed that you've got your PTC attitude peaked up a bit, and I'll check on your tape dump.
Apollo 8, Houston. The quality of the tape dump has been very good. We have about 15 minutes to dump, which we will do the next time we get high gain. Over.
How's the voice quality been?
It's been very good, Frank.
Okay. We'll send you something down here shortly.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Frank, on this tape recorder, we have the tape motion stopped right now. If you would like to record some, we will give you the tape in motion so that you may do so. Is that what you would like? Over.
Roger. Houston, why don't you just give us salvo so we can control the switches here.
Okay. Stand by.
... PCM LOW and stop.
You should have it now. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Are you capable of taking a high-bit FM dump for voice on the OMNI's?
That is negative, Bill. Not quite, on the OMNI's.
Okay. We will catch you next time around then.
Roger. Thank you.
Good morning, Mike. How are things going down there?
Hi, Jim. Things are going real fine. How are you doing up there? Did you get a good night's sleep?
Oh, you know. The first night in space all the time; it's a little slow.
The old man woke you up earlier than he needed to.
Well, we just couldn't sleep any longer.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. The next time you are locked up on the high gain, give us a call, and we will configure for a dump. Over.
Roger. We would like an evaluation of the voice comments. Over.
Roger. Understand. So far, it's been very good. We will evaluate this one as soon as we can.
How are the systems looking down there, Houston?
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. I've been in the sack. How do the systems look?
Everything is looking real good, Bill.
Okay. How much longer do you expect on charging battery A?
Stand by, Bill. We will get you an exact number on it.
Just a rough estimate. And also, have you seen any more hints on that sensor problem on fuel cell 2?
Stand by one. I'll get the latest scoop on it for you, Bill.
Bill, there is nothing new on fuel cell number 2. We don't think there is anything at all wrong with the fuel cell. It's some sort of a sensor problem, but we don't have any new information on it.
Okay. They all look pretty good from here, Mike.
Roger. Thank you.
I've got some updates for you whenever you are ready to copy.
Stand by.
Okay.
What kind?
Well, I've got a TLI plus 35 hour update, and then I have an update to Jim's checklist.
Let's have the TLI plus 30 before we get the checklist update.
They never give up on the checklist, do they?
Okay. This - when you get your maneuver PAD book out - the last maneuver PAD we gave you for the flyby PAD still remains valid. We would just like to remark that the entry angle, the Gamma, is slightly steeper than we consider ideal, but it's within our - sort of the noise level of our ability to predict at this time. So that flyby maneuver PAD remains valid. Over.
Roger, Houston.
Okay. Now on that page with the flyby maneuver, under your north set of stars, I have some new numbers for you because we've changed those stars from Navi and Polaris. As you recall, we changed to Sirius and Rigel, so - And that also, by the way, is the checklist update which I will give you later - but on that maneuver PAD, I have got three new angles for you using Sirius and Rigel when you are ready to copy those.
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Roger, Apollo 8. Houston. You are loud and clear now. We had a lot of background noise there for a few minutes. How are you reading me?
Roger. I'm reading you okay, Mike, and I read you the last time you asked me that, so I guess maybe I wasn't getting through to you.
Okay. Well, did you copy on this flyby maneuver PAD? We've got three new angles. Are you ready to copy those?
I'm ready to copy the flyby angles.
Okay. Roll 137. pitch 310, yaw 340. Over.
Roger. Roll 137, pitch 310, yaw 340.
That's affirmative, and I have the TLI plus 35 hour PAD when you are ready for it.
Roger. Ready for the TLI plus 35.
Roger. TLI plus 35 hours, SPS/G&N, 63023 minus 162 plus 129. Are you with me so far?
Loud and clear.
Good. 037:56:51.38, plus 00068, plus 00000, plus 46420 178 134 001, not applicable, plus 00202 46420 547 46211. Are you with me? Over.

Good. 12 1383 327 023 up 172 left 22, plus 1293, minus 16500, 12905 36180 074:11:16. Comments: on your stars Sirius and Rigel, roll 010, pitch 294, yaw 320, no ullage. Other: one, fast return P37, ΔV|DELTA-V equals 7821, for mid-Pacific landing for MTL; two, high speed procedures not required. Over.
Roger. Are you ready for the readback?
All set.
TLI plus 35, SPS/G&N 63023, minus 162, plus 129 037:56:51.38, plus 00068, plus 00000, plus 46420 178 134 000, NA. Are you with me?
Yes, I'm with you, Bill. That last one should be 001.
Roger. Y 001, NA, plus 00202 46420 547 46211 12 1383 327 023 up 172 left 22, plus 1293, minus 16500, plus 12905, plus 36180 074:11:16, Sirius, Rigel: 010 294 320, no ullage, fast return P37, 7821 mid-PAC; high speed not required. Over.
That's about the size of it. You're getting pretty good at this thing, Bill, for a rookie.
Not bad. I just learned to read about a year ago.
Roger. Hey, I've got a flight plan update for Jim. It's on page G, George, 82 Able of his checklist. Over.
Roger. I've got it open. Go ahead, Mike.
Okay. It's simply changing these north set of stars around. For Navi substitute Sirius, which is number 15, and for Rigel - correction - for Polaris substitute Rigel, number 12.
Roger. Substitute Rigel for Polaris and Sirius for Navi. How about shaft and trunnion; remain the same?
Your shaft and trunnions remain the same. Sirius remains on the 50-degree line just like Navi used to be. Rigel is down 1.3 degrees from your horizontal, from your M-line. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Okay. And let me know when it gets to be breakfast time. I've got a newspaper to read up to you and a few other things.
We're ready.
Okay. I've got a Haney special here for you. The Interstellar Times latest edition says the flight to the moon is occupying prime space on both paper and television; it's THE news story. The headlines of the Post says "Moon, here they come". We understand that Bill Anders will be in private conversation or communication today with an old man who wears a red suit and lives at the North Pole. A suspect in the Miami kidnapping was captured late yesterday, and the 11 GI's that have been detained 5 months in Cambodia were released yesterday and will make it home in time for Christmas.
Roger. With reference to the first, we saw him earlier this morning, and he was heading your way.
Roger. We'll pass the word along. David Eisenhower and Julie Nixon were married yesterday in New York. He was described as "nervous".
Right.
The Browns took Dallas apart yesterday 31 to 20. We're sort of curious, who do you like today, Baltimore or Minnesota? Over.
Baltimore.
How many points are you giving?
(Laughter) He's not making many points at home with that comment.
Roger. Understand. Oh, I've got another score for you when you are ready to copy. Are you ready to copy?
Stand by. Go ahead.
Roger. Navy 14, Army 21. Would you like for me to repeat that? Over.
You are very garbled; Houston; I'm unable to read. Will call you back in another year.
Okay. We also notice the University of Houston lost their first home basketball game in 3-1/2 years last night. Illinois edged them out 97 to 84. And some really big news: the State Department announced only a few minutes ago that the Pueblo crew will be released at 9 p.m. tonight.
Sounds good. Outboard calculations indicate that Apollo 8 at 25 hours is 104 000 miles from home.
Yes. Our plot board shows a similar number.
Mighty nice view from here.
We're showing about 104 800 miles, and we're guessing another 8 to 10 hours on your battery charge.
Okay.
Frank, say again about the view. You were blocked, I think.
This is a mighty nice view we have down there today. A little bit more than a half earth. Looks like Africa and the Red Sea is visible; we're not quite sure as there is quite a bit of cloud cover; but even through the hazy windows, it's mighty nice.
How are your windows? Do you have a couple left that are real clear?
The rendezvous windows are good. The others are all about the same as they were when we last reported. One and five have a slight haze and a little fog on the inside.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
...
Roger. Just as a matter of curiosity for Bill, we can say a few words about the heaters for the cryo tanks, and also for the fans. We've noticed that the heaters are doing their thing normally, cycling on and off; and as time goes by, this cycle rate increases, indicating a little bit of stratification in the tanks. And then when we've been turning the fans on every 4 hours for a couple of minutes, this stirs things up and the heaters then cycling on and off again more slowly for awhile, until again a little bit of stratification occurs, and the cycling becomes slightly more rapid. This is, of course, normal; we just point it out as a curiosity to you. Over.
Roger. I haven't really been following it that close. One thing I have noticed is when you turn the fans on you get a glitch in the quantity, which might correspond to a glitch in AC. Maybe the next time we'll look at the AC volts and see what happens.
Our experts say that's not the reason for the glitch. They say the stratification fakes out the capacitance sensor there for a second.
I knew they would have some big deal answer for me.
... got you today.
I'll buy that.
Roger.
Any other information you want us to send up to you?
No, we're going to zap you with the high gain here shortly.
Okay.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. How do you read on the high gain?
Reading you loud and clear, Bill. How me?
I'm reading you loud and clear. I'll go ahead and dump this. You might want to listen to it in real time to evaluate the voice.
Okay. We'll do that as soon as we can.
Give me a call when you are ready.
Do you want to dump it by your command, or would you like us to command the dump on it? Over.
Oh, you can go ahead and command whenever you are ready.
Okay. we are starting now; thank you.
I've already rewound.
Roger.
Roger. I've already rewound.
There is only about 5 minutes worth on the tape, Houston.
Roger. Understand, Bill. You promised me you would wait 3 days before you started doing this, Bill.
It has been a long trip.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Bill. We've got your dump, and the voice quality is very good. We we going to take about 20 minutes or so to get it back to Houston to play it.
Roger. Where are you taking it through, Houston?
It comes through Madrid and then Ascension, Bill.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Roger, Bill. We are reading you loud and clear now. We had an antenna problem down here. We had an unexpected switch of antenna, which probably caused your high gain to quit.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead,Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Jim. When we lost our antenna down here, we interrupted your tape dump, so we are in the process of doing some rewinding and continuing the dump, in case Bill is wondering what is going on with the tape recorder.
Okay. No strain.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. At 26 hours GET, we'll be switching our antennas back again at Madrid, and you can expect a glitch on your COMM system.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Jim.
I noticed that you skipped the IMU alignment for about 26 hours because we were still asleep. Do you want to include that again, or do you think it is required?
Roger, Jim. We think it is going to be required prior to the next set of P23 sightings, and we're suggesting that it be put in at 27:45. We'll have a flight plan - a more complete flight plan update in here shortly.
Okay. Fine. We're in the process of having breakfast.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
The tape dumps are complete; it's rewound. You can go ahead and record in low bit rate if you ...
Roger. Will do.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Disregard. We were going to talk about the high gain, but you beat us to it.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. We would like to take control of the tape for a few minutes to make sure that we got all that last dump. Over.
Okay. Stand by one.
Roger.
You've got it.
Thank you, sir.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. I just noticed that I can hear those RTC's coming through on normal voice.
What does it sound like, Bill?
A little squeak.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. I have a flight plan update for you sometime at your convenience.
Alright.
Ready to copy.
Apollo 8, Houston. Were you calling? Over.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay, Bill. This will be on page 2 dash 22 of your flight plan.  For the command module pilot - I've already mentioned it to him - but at the top of the page, at about 27:45, actually, we would like him to do a P52, an IMU alignment, and then the P23 should be done as scheduled. Those four stars, Procyon, Regulus, Alphard, and Spica: we realize Alphard may not be too good a star, Regulus is about 3 degrees above the horizon, and Spica is at a 48-degree trunnion angle; so I guess what we are saying is if Jim has difficulty doing one set on each of those four stars, we suggest that he omit whichever one he is having difficulty with and pick it up by doing two sets on some other star that he likes. Over.
Roger. Understand.
All right. In the lower right hand corner of page 2-22, the passive thermal control attitude should read "pitch 224 degrees, yaw 020."
Roger. Copy.
And on the next page, at about 29 hours, you can resume the normal flight plan. We would like to make one addition; at 29:30, add a waste water dump. Even though one is not really required at that time, we would like to get the dump out of the way so we can track you uninterruptedly without any dumping, you know, as we are coming up on midcourse correction number 3. Over.
Roger.
That's about all, Bill. You got any questions on this?
No, it looks pretty good. We've been saving up some water of our own to dump here, so that will work out all right.
Very good. And don't ruin Jim's optics.
Right.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go.
Roger. We would like P00 in ACCEPT, please. We would like to send you up a P27. It's a LM state vector, going into the LM slot only, and we do not want you to transfer it over to the CSM.
Apollo 8. Houston. Did you copy?
Roger. You got it.
Okay. We got it. We're sending you a LM state vector, and we would like you not to transfer that vector over to the CSM slot.
Roger.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8. Roger. Are you still planning an MCC 2 at 28 hours? Over.
Stand by one, Bill. Bill, negative. Now that midcourse correction number 2 has been cancelled. Its magnitude was less than 1 foot per second, so we decided not to do it. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
And you've got the computer again, if you go to BLOCK.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Are you still computing the pericynthian time of 6910.
Stand by. We will get an update for you.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Your 6910 pericynthian is still good plus or minus a minute, and we will get it down to a fine map measurement ...
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. This is Apollo 8.
Okay, Bill. We just got your readout on your voice tape, and we will be back with you on it shortly. Over.
Okay.
Houston, I'm going to be doing my alignment at this time. I'm in a good position for viewing the stars.
Roger, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with voice check. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Read you loud and clear now. How us?
Oh, good. Reading you loud and clear. One, two, three, four, five, five, four, three, two, one. Am I cutting in and out still? Over.
Nope. All the numbers are coming up nicely.
Okay. Thank you, Jim.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are going to switch antennas at 28:20. Stand by for our blitz.
Roger, Houston. And we will start passing thermal control, and we are maneuvering to P23.
Roger. Understand; maneuvering to P23; I understand.
Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. You copy high bit rate now for this P23?
Negative, Bill. We are getting low bit rate now.
If you go high bit rate, we will not bother recording it.
Roger. We just went to high bit rate.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. Cislunar NAV accomplished. We did two sets on star 16, two sets on 22, and one set on 21.
Roger. Understand P23 completed, two sets on 16, two on 22, and one on 21.
Roger. It was getting a little late, so we didn't want to start on 26.
Roger. Understand, Jim.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Is our previous PTC attitude okay for the next session?
Roger, Bill. The one that we updated an hour or so ago, (i.e., pitch 224, yaw 020) is a good one.
224 20. Roger.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We will change antennas in about 2 minutes. You can expect a glitch in your COMM.
Roger.
Roger.
How are all of the systems looking down there, Houston?
Apollo 8, Houston. You are looking good here in all respects.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger. Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. We are dumping some water we collected here, and we are ready to dump the waste water down to 25 percent. Do you concur?
Roger. We concur. We are standing by for your dump.
Alright. We've already started the other.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. This is Apollo 8.
Roger. We are getting geared up down here to do the first of the COMM checks. We will be doing an OMNI COMM check, which is on your flight plan, listed mode 7.8, and we will let you know when we are ready to proceed.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger, Houston. We are dumping waste water now. How is the nozzle temperature?
Stand by. Looks good, Bill; 64 degrees. Over.
Roger. We just got an O<sub>2</sub> flow high from purging to vent line on the cabin.
Roger. Understand.
How is everything in Houston?
Oh, just fine, Frank. Everything down here is GO. How are you?
Fine. What is the news?
Well, did you get the intergalactic news summary we sent up to you a couple of hours ago? It might have been during your rest period. We gave you a couple of football scores. One of them in particular was - I don't know if you copied that - Army 21, Navy 14. Over.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven; testing out.
I got that one.
Roger. The Cowboys were destroyed by the Cleveland Browns yesterday. The Pueblo crew is expected to be released. And I now hear our air-to-ground has got a lot of background noise. Stand by; we are going to go through these COMM test modes on page 223 of the flight plan. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Would you go S-band AUX switch to DOWN-VOICE BACKUP. Over.
DOWN-VOICE BACKUP. Roger and out.
Thank you.
Houston, be advised that it looks like your Quindars are clipping your voice during your transmission.
Roger, Understand. Are we still experiencing this intermittent condition that was there a few minutes ago?
Not always, but often in the beginning and in the end of your transmission.
Roger. Understand. I'll give it a little extra time.
Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Could you try to find us a better OMNI antenna? Over.
...
Apollo 8, Houston. We are unable to read you on this OMNI antenna. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. ...
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. We understand you are copying us. While we are trying to reestablish contact with you, would you put your optics switch to zero? We show you are drifting off in trunnion and request that you zero your optics.
Apollo 8, Houston. We copy your optics zeroed, and how are you reading us now? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are down to 25 percent on your waste water dump and ready to terminate. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Our next COMM test is ranging only test. I have four switches I would like you to throw, which will cause you to lose voice communications for approximately 3 minutes. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Alright. The first one is S-band NORMAL mode voice, OFF; the second, S-band NORMAL mode PCM, OFF; the third, S-band NORMAL mode RANGING switch to RANGING; and fourth, the S-baud AUX tape switch, OFF. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Request S-band NORMAL mode RANGING to OFF and S-band NORMAL mode PCM to PCM. I say again. S-band NORMAL mode RANGING, OFF; S-band NORMAL mode PCM to PCM.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'll stand by in this configuration for a moment.
Apollo 8, Houston. Three communication switch positions. First, S-band AUX tape to DOWN-VOICE BACKUP; S-band NORMAL mode PCM, OFF; TELEMETRY INPUTS PCM, HIGH. I say again, S-band AUX tape to DOWN-VOICE BACKUP; S-band NORMAL mode PCM to OFF; TELEMETRY INPUTS PCM to HIGH.
Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 8. How do you read?
Reading you weak but clear now, Bill.
Roger. We still have a bad look angle on this antenna.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Please be informed that the ... Over.
Apollo 8. Houston. Unable to copy. After about a minute of this configuration, we're going to return to normal voice, and at that time we should be able to hear you better.
Roger. What ... are we going through right now?
Roger. We are in Mode 7 dash 10, and the COMM test mode is on page 223. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Three switch positions. TELEMETRY INPUTS PCM switch to LOW; S-band NORMAL mode VOICE to VOICE; S-band NORMAL mode PCM to PCM. I say again, TELEMETRY INPUTS PCM switch, LOW; S-band NORMAL mode VOICE to VOICE; S-band NORMAL mode PCM to PCM. Over.
Roger. We're switching over to backup now.
Reading you very weak.
We are reading you loud and clear, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Requesting S-band NORMAL mode ranging to RANGING. I say again. S-band NORMAL mode ranging to RANGE. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Requesting S-band NORMAL mode ranging to RANGING. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Houston, Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Beautiful, Frank. I'm reading you loud and clear. How me?
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
You're loud and clear, Michael.
Okay. We're still looking for the S-band NORMAL mode ranging to RANGING.
I guess we didn't hear that one. Going to RANGING.
Roger.
It's in RANGING now.
Thank you.
And - Houston, Apollo 8 - what size antenna are you going to now?
Apollo 8, Houston. We're working through Ascension, a 30-footer. Over.
Okay. We - our signal strength is ... AGC is pretty low up here.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Requesting S-band OFF state to OFF. This should put us back in the normal configuration. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. S-band OFF state to OFF. That returns us to normal configuration, and we need a couple or items from you. First, the CMP and LMP status report (including PRD readings on all three crewmembers), and we'd like to know did you chlorinate the water after your last meal. Over.
No, we haven't chlorinated the water, yet. We'll get the other for you.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston, do you show the FM - Houston, Apollo 8 - do you show the FM on now?
Stand by and we'll check it, Bill.
Because our S-baud off state has been OFF. Possibly - we don't have control of it.
Apollo 8, Houston. We've switched on all the communications switch; functions are operating normally, Bill.
Okay, Mike. Thanks.
Mike, the PRD readings for the CDR are 4 - that's 0.04, for the CMP is 0.64, and for the LMP is 0.25.
Good. I copy 0.04, 0.64, 0.25. Thank you.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Oh, hi, Ken. How are you doing?
Roger. Fine. How you been?
Is this Jerry?
This is Ken.
Hey, listen, we still have this TV coming up here - let's see - 31:20?
Affirmative.
We're about in the right position for high gain; we wondered if you wanted to take a trial run and see if it will work. Or do you just want to wait and try it when they're supposed to go on the air with it?
Okay. Stand by on that.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Could you ask the GNC to give us an update on our prop quantity, please?
Wilco. You're referring to the RCS?
Roger.
If you'll give it to me kinda slow, I'll plot it.
Roger. It's coming now.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. In reference the early TV, we're losing the high-gain antenna now, and it looks like the only way we would have gotten the early TV pass in anyhow was to send it to remote site and look at it there. So we're going to scrub that idea and we'll just pick up with the scheduled TV. The COMM checks that are remaining are the high-gain dependent type, and we'll put those off until the TV session is completed, and we are working on the fuel propellant curve for you now.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay, Apollo 8. What we're going to do on the TV is to go ahead and let you crank it up as soon as we get back on the high-gain antenna, and it looks like - my guess is that this will be about 31:07, and we'll just use this to - as long as we have the coverage there. I have an update to your TLI plus 35 PAD. Now we have to correct a couple of times on there. So when you get that out, let me know and I'll read it to you.
Go ahead.
Okay. On the TLI plus 35 pass, the update I want to give you is the last three lines in the block: the EMS range to go 13084 35985 0984217. Over.
Understand. Range to go 13084 35985 0984217.
Affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are about to have a handover to Goldstone, and our downlink isn't improved then. I don't know if you'll notice any difference in the uplink or not.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. You are loud and clear.
Okay. We have switched sites over to Goldstone now. I don't know if you can tell any difference in our uplink.
Negative. You're about the same.
Okay. You have cleared up quite a bit. Sounds a lot better to us.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
I have some RCS quantity data for you. We are all set up to receive the TV whenever you get high gain looking at us.
Okay. Let me get the chart out here.
Go ahead with the quad propellant quantities, please.
Okay, Apollo 8, Alfa, I have 225 pounds, 74 percent; Bravo 240 - -
Slower, please.
Roger. I will repeat. Alfa 225, 74 percent; Bravo 240 pounds, 79 percent; Charlie 236, 78 percent; Delta 238, 19 percent. I would like to remind you on the TV that we need narrow beam width when you get up in high gain. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8. Loud and clear and standing by.
Say again.
We read you loud and clear, and we're standing by.
Okay.
Are you receiving television now?
Apollo 8, Houston. We just got it.
You are getting it?
Okay, Apollo 8. We have a good picture.
We're rolling a -
Okay. We're rolling around to a good view of the earth, and as soon as we get to the good view of the earth, we'll stop and let you look out the window at the scene that we see. Jim Lovell's down in lower equipment bay preparing lunch, and Bill is holding a camera here for us both.
Bill's going to take the camera down to the lower equipment deck with Jim.
Roger.
Okay. We're getting a pretty good picture, but if you'd move it a little slower - every time you move it around, it breaks up the scan.
We gotcha.
(Laughter)
This is known as preparing lunch and doing P23 at the same time.
You've got everybody standing on their heads down here.
How go - Has he got it turned upside down? You've got the wrong REFSMMAT.
Well, we all have our problems.
How is the picture now, Houston?
They are really good.
Okay. Now we are coming up on the view that we really want you to see. That's the view of the earth, and if you will break for just a minute, Bill is going to put on the large lens. So we will be right back with you.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, we are now showing you a view of the earth through the telephoto lens.
Okay. We are not receiving a picture right now.
How about now?
Okay. We don't have a picture yet.
You seeing anything at all, Houston?
Okay, Apollo 8. We don't have a picture yet.
Alright. We will put the other lens back on, and we will show you that.
Apollo 8, how about standing by on that for just a minute. Let's check our ground link.
Apollo 8, we have a picture now.
Okay. Let's try the other lens again then, once again.
Okay. Thank you.
Do you have a picture now?
That's negative.
Apollo 8, ...
Okay. Do you have anything. Houston? We have it on the earth.
We are having no joy.
Okay. Standby.
Okay. How about now, Houston?
Still no joy.
You don't have a lens cover on there, do you?
No. We checked that, as a matter of fact.
Anything?
Still no joy.
How about now?
Still no joy. There is a picture. We have a picture. Okay. It is a little difficult to see what we have.
That is the earth, but it is not the telephoto lens, unfortunately. It is just a regular inside lens.
Okay. It is coming in as a real bright blob on the screen. It is hard to tell what we are looking at.
You are looking through some haze on the windows too, unfortunately.
And the earth is very bright, besides.
Okay. We got the earth in about the center of the screen and a little bit low, and it looked like there were some objects that moved across it - the screen at the same time. Do you have any comment on those?
That is some of the water - ice coming off the vent nozzle.
Roger.
How does it look now?
Still the same thing; it is - the target is extremely bright, and it is very difficult to make out what we are looking at.
It is unfortunate that we do not have - we can't make the other lens work here. I don't know what the problem is.
Okay. Apollo 8, would you verify that the ALC is on?
We have tried it both ways.
Oh, okay; thank you. What we are getting now is a good picture.
Say again.
Okay. That's a - that's a real good picture. That is the best one that we have had. And how about going ahead and just leaving your pictures inside until we can think some more of what we can do to adjust for that light?
Roger. Jim, what are you doing here? Jim is fixing dessert. He is making up a bag of chocolate pudding. You can see it come floating by. Bill is coming up from the lower equipment bay. It is unfortunate that this telephoto lens. doesn't work. Show them the lens that's the culprit here, Jim. This lens doesn't seem to be working; I can't understand why we're not - perhaps it's a problem of light transmission through it.
This transmission is coming to you approximately halfway between the moon and the earth. We have been 31 hours and about 20 minutes into flight. We have about less than 40 hours to go to the moon. You can see that Bill has his toothbrush here. He has been brushing regularly. To demonstrate how things float around in zero g. It looks like he plays for the Astros, the way he tries to catch those things. I certainly wish that we could show you the earth. It is a beautiful, beautiful view, with predominately blue background and just huge covers of white clouds, particularly one very strong vortex up near the terminator. Very, very beautiful. Perhaps we will get some assistance from the people on the ground and be able to deter - to determine why this other lens is not transmitting properly.
Houston, did you get any light at all coming through that telephoto lens?
Apollo 8, we were getting what you were showing us on your normal lens, and I don't think we got anything on the telephoto. We are working on this now. One of the problems seems to be that it is a low light level lens; we're afraid that you might burn it out pointing it at something too bright.
Well, the earth is very, very bright. There is nothing in the lens you can burn out. The camera still seems to be working. We can give you a lumens reading of the earth right now if you like.
Hey, Frank, how about a couple of words on your health for the wide world.
Well, we are all in very good shape. Jim is busy working preparing lunch. Bill is playing cameraman right now, and I am about to take a light reading on the earth. We all feel fine. It was a very exciting ride on that big Saturn, but it worked perfectly, and we are looking forward now, of course, for the day after tomorrow when we will be just 60 miles any from the moon.
Roger. You all look great on candid TV.
Okay. I just got a reading on the earth, Houston. It is 320. The earth is showing 320 lumens now. If you get a closeup of Jim Lovell, Bill, you can let everyone see he has already outdistanced us in the beard race. Jim has got quite a beard going already.
Happy birthday, Mother.
Okay. Jim is going to take a shot of us from the lower equipment bay, and then we have to get back to our passive thermal control in the bar-b-que mode so that we don't get one side of the spacecraft too hot for too long at a time. So we will be signing off here, and we will be looking forward to seeing you all again shortly.
Roger.
Goodbye from Apollo 8.
Thank you. That's a good show.
I hope we can get that other lens fixed or some reading on it.
Roger. We are going to work on that one. The one that is sensitive to light is the lens that you were just using. You want to be careful about pointing that at some bright object.
Roger. We are starting PTC again.
I believe that's only if it hasn't been used for quite a while, Ken.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead Houston, Apollo 8.
Okay, I've got a few items for you I'd like to clear up and then we'll let you alone for a while. The first thing is we would like for you to confirm that your spot meter had an ASA setting of 100.
That is confirmed.
Okay, we thank you. That's one of the first questions that came to mind. We are ready for a cryo fan cycle at any time and use your normal procedures.
Okay.
All right. You can anticipate a fuel cell purge at 35 hours, and we ought to be through with battery A charging somewhere after 34 hours; and looks like you'll have just about a full battery there. And we will give you a call on the exact time to cut it off. We would like to get some confirmation from you on the chlorine procedures. Did you get some in last night or not? Just a quick summary of how much sleep you got on Lovell and Anders?
Okay. We got the chlorine in and the water has been chlorinated and just a minute I will check with them on their sleep.
I am sorry I didn't copy that sleep.
Say again, Ken.
I am sorry I didn't copy your last, Frank.
I was asking you to say, to say what you said. Jim had about 4 hours sleep, and Bill had about 3 hours sleep.
Okay. Thank you very much.
We feel pretty good today. We would like to see, in looking over the flight plan - perhaps we ought to put the rest periods a little bit shorter and more frequent. It seems it might work out better. We got all out of kilter on it yesterday. We are sort of trying to get back in a normal cycle.
Okay. We will look into that.
You all are doing good work. Keep it up.
Thank you. Looks like the only other thing we have left over is a COMM check and if we can work that in without interrupting your present schedule we would like to.
Okay. Right now we are stopping for a break, but we will go ahead and do that. What does it involve?
Okay. We will need the high-gain antenna, and there should be no COMM loss during this mode.
Okay, Ken. I think we are going to lose the high gain here shortly. Why don't we pick it up next time it comes around?
Real fine.
Remember, the most important part of the trip occurs in two days when we start back. So you all get better rested too.
We'll do that.
Affirmative, Apollo 8.
Houston, we're starting the H<sub>2</sub> fan now.
Roger, thank you.
Houston, you just wanted 2 minutes cycling on those fans don't you? Two minutes each?
That's affirmative, Apollo 8.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8 on high gain stand by for your communications check.
Okay, standing by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead Houston, Apollo 8.
Okay. Apollo 8. Looks like we're going to have to put this COMM test off because of some tracking requirements. We can do it in about an hour if this will not interfere with your present operations too much. It'll take maybe 15 to 20 minutes, and it will involve some conversation on the part of the people onboard the spacecraft. So if that's going to interfere with your sleeping and all, why go ahead and we'll defer to that and we'll pick these requirements up at another time. And, we've got a score here, looks like Baltimore 21 to nothing.
Who were they playing?
How about Minnesota.
That's from that other league.
How did last year's Army-Navy game come out?
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. We've stirred up all the cryos. Could you give me your quantities, please?
Okay. Stand by.
Roger. Be advised the CMP just hit the hay for awhile, and the LMP will go down in a little while.
Okay. And our guys down here are watching high-gain antenna pointing program, so anytime you're not using the DSKY for anything else, they'd like to watch it for a couple of cycles, so if you would leave that NOUN 51 on the display it will help a lot down here.
Okay. Why don't you give us REACQ angles, and we'll try that for the next time.
Okay.
Apollo 8, are you ready to copy some cryo quantities?
I'm ready. How about O<sub>2</sub> first.
Okay. O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, I show 88.1 percent.
Okay. Could you give it to me in pounds, please?
Okay. You'll have to stand by while we convert that.
Thank you.
That's okay, Gene, go ahead, I'll take the percent.
Okay. We will try and get the pounds for you, too, Bill. Tank 1, oxygen 88.1.
What time is that for?
This is present.
32:30, okay.
Okay, I've got 32:35. And O<sub>2</sub> - -
In weight not percentage.
Okay, O<sub>2</sub> tank 1, 88.1, O<sub>2</sub> tank 2, 87.37.
Is that 0.37 or 0.36?
0.37.
Roger, 2. Got it.
Okay, 2 tank 1, 75.97. Tank 2, 78.06. Over.
Okay, thank you very much. It looks good.
Okay, thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 8.
Okay. I've got a couple of things we need from you. I would like to get a battery C voltage. I would like to check a battery manifold pressure. Your high gain - -
Battery C is 37 volts.
Understand 37 volts on battery C. Is that affirm?
3, 7.
Okay, thank you. And if you can get to the battery manifold pressure, like to read that one.
0.6 volts.
All right understand 0.6 volts. The angles you asked for on the high-gain antenna are pitch minus 45, and yaw 90.
Okay. Houston, this is Apollo 8. I'm going to just go into high gain now, and we're about ready to pick you up ... works on REACQ.
Okay, and I have a scanning telescope star visibility item for you to pick up, when you're ready to copy that.
Roger, we'll get that on high gain when we get back to you.
Okay, thank you.
We'll come back on high-gain.
Roger.
That's not fair, we're there already.
That's pretty good acquisition, huh?
You guys are reading the DSKY. Go ahead Houston.
Okay, Apollo 8. Maybe we ought to try that one again next time, and the scanning telescope star visibility is scheduled for a 34 10 in the flight plan, and it'll be star number 31. The angles are roll 184.7, pitch 23.4, yaw 14.3, shaft and trunnion zero. Over.
Understand; star 31, roll 184 7, pitch 23 4, yaw 14 3, and star shaft and trunnion at zero.
That's affirm, and that's copy star 31.
That's Roger, 31.
Okay, thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
The LMP would like to take a Seconal and hit the hay.
Okay. That's a GO.
Okay, thank you.
And that ...
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We'd like to go ahead and get into this COMM check here, on the last of this high-gain period. If you're ready to go on it I'll read you some witches.
Stand by. We're ready. Go ahead.
Okay. Number 1. S-band normal mode voice to VOICE.
Go ahead - keep going.
Uptelemetry data to DATA.
CDR Normal mode voice to VOICE. Uptelemetry data to DATA.
Okay, uptelemetry command to NORMAL.
NORMAL.
High-gain antenna track, AUTO.
Roger. Going AUTO.
High-gain antenna beam width to NARROW.
Beam-width NARROW.
Okay, this will be our base-line data check. This will be a full uplink voice with ranging and full downlink.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are going to have to delay the COMM check again.
Houston, Apollo 8. how do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you call?
Roger. We lost you for a while there. Are you reading us there now?
Loud and clear now.
Okay. Thank you. So are we.
Okay, Apollo 8. Do you want to try that AUTO REACQ? 33 plus 24 looks like a good time and the angles are the same. And the late ball scores is 24 to 14 - -
...
All right.
Say it again.
I say a late ball score there is - -
... the ball score?
2, 4 to 1, 4.
Baltimore over the Vikings?
Affirm.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
We have reached the scan limit on the high gain. what do you want us to do about it now?
Apollo 8, what we would like to do with these angles is to set it in AUTO REACQ over on panel 2, and it is under the tracking for the high-gain antenna, and it'll - the lower position will say REACQ, and on the position dials we would like to set pitch to minus 45 and the yaw to 90.
Pitch minus 45, yaw 90.
Okay. Stand by 1.
Roger. If we could leave it in REACQ if you want to use the high gain, it would keep from waking us up every REV.
Apollo 8, Houston. I think we may have gotten off on a tangent. These pitch and yaw angles that we called up to you for the high-gain antenna were in response to Bill's request to know what positions we could put on there for a - for the AUTO REACQ position. The constraint still remains if we don't want to be on an OMNI antenna at the same time. We are in the AUTO REACQ position; we should be in one or the other. So you can use that information if you want to try it out. Otherwise, the procedures you've been using all along will be just fine. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. I am transmitting in the blind right now. Our downlink isn't working so well; I'm just going ahead on an uplink.
Houston, do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, read you weak but clear now.
Roger. Thank you.
Okay. Looks like we had a ground problem there.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
- okay. Looks like we're - -
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
- - Looks like we're in a good attitude to try this high-gain antenna on the COMM check one more time. I believe you're still on an OMNI. Is that correct?
Roger.
Okay. If we could try the high gain and maybe we can get started on this COMM check. I'd also like to verify that you've got the LMP and the CMP trying to get some sleep here, and we could use an oral temp from you, too.
Roger. My temperature is 97.5.
Okay. Thank you.
That's what it was this morning when I felt badly.
Alright; thank you.
Do you want me to go to OMNI now, Ken?
I'd like for you to go to high gain.
High gain?
Yes, sir.
High gain.
This is Apollo 8 on high gain.
Roger. Reading you kind of weak now, but we're gonna take a look at it.
Houston, Apollo 8 on high gain.
Okay. I'm reading you loud with just a little background noise.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're not getting a good lock. I wonder if we could try making sure that we're in AUTO on the tracks and that we're in narrow beam width?
Standby.
How's that, Houston?
Okay. That works reel good.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. What we're doing right now is collecting baseline data, and we'll be in this mode for another couple of minutes and then we'll be moving out to the second signal.
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 8. Read you five-by.
Okay. We are ... we have some ground problems, and we're reading you weak but clear. We're ready to start into our test. We're going to be changing our modes so you'll probably hear a burst of noise as we make the change. This will be a noise that sounds like an S-band onlock. However, your AEC leader will lock that off. This is due to the loss of modulation on the uplink. There will be about 2 minutes, and during this time, you will hear one burst of noise.
Apollo 8, Houston. Voice check. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Ready to check.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Do you read?
That's affirmative.
Okay. Thank you. Were you reading all along? We just - This is the first time we've heard you call back.
We've been reading you; we're trying to hold the noise down so we can get some sleep.
Roger. We'll be through with this in just a minute, I think.
Roger. I will answer you, but I'll try to do it quietly.
Okay, Bill.
Okay, Apollo 8. The next portion of our test is like we did yesterday; We'll be changing the uplink modes to uplink command and ranging with no upvoice. We'll be in this mode for approximately 2 and 1/2 minutes and send two test messages. During this time, we will not have uplink. We are going to this mode at time 33:48:30, and we'll be back in this configuration at 33:50:00. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.
Loud and clear, Houston.
Okay, fine. How about telemetry inputs PCM switch to LOW, please?
They're in LOW, Houston.
Roger.
Apollo 8, we've completed the third test; we're going into the final test now. PCM switch to HIGH, please.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're going to switch uplink to the upvoice backup for about 2 minutes, and may take a few seconds to link the transition. And we'll be back up at 33:56 in our normal mode to place the up-telemetry data switch to upvoice backup at this time. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston on backup voice.
Loud and clear, Houston.
Okay, fine; thank you.
Apollo 8, let's go back up-telemetry data switch to DATA.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Stand by; guess we've got 85-foot site voice back now; the noise went away.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Apollo 8. That completes our COMM test. Thanks for your cooperation. And I've got a change here to NAV sightings that will come up at 32:20. And we want to change your star a little bit there. Are you ready to copy?
Ready to copy.
Okay.
Ready to copy.
Okay, Apollo 8. We would like to change the NAV sighting as follows: we would like to use star 26, that is, two-six; we would like to make it earth-near horizon for two sets, two sets. Then we would like to take star 16 earth-far horizon, one set. If star 26 earth-near horizon is not possible, star 16 earth-far horizon, one set, and star 22 earth-far horizon, one set. Over.
Roger, Houston. Be advised the CMP is asleep ... putting those on for a while.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, okay; we can put this off. What we will probably need from you is some kind of an estimate of when you think somebody will be available to work on it, and we are working on how much lead time we need now.
Stand by ...
Roger.
Houston, why don't you figure the CMP will sleep another couple of hours, then the LMP, and then the CDR up to about 43 hours equally. Over.
Okay.
Then we will start off with the CMP again at about 44.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We can put off this NAV sighting. It was scheduled here at 34:20, and we can put it off, Judging from your comments about sleeping, we would like to get it as soon as we can, and right now, our plans are to slide it 2 hours. We will do the P52 by sliding it back to the same thing since it is associated with the P23. So If that's a convenient time for you, why we will plan on that.
We are doing the P52 now. Do you want us to continue?
Well, as far as we are concerned, that isn't going to help us any. We will have to do it over again anyhow.
Okay. And what time do you want to do it?
Well, if you think Jim's going to be up in a couple of hours, why that will slide us 2 hours to 36:20.
Okay. We will go ahead and make another one there and pick it up then if that's okay.
Okay. That will be real fine. Thank you.
What we are going to try to do is get back on the sleep cycle to those sleep periods just prior to LOI by taking shorter cycles for each man.
Real fine.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, go ahead.
How about giving us some REACQ angles, and we'll. stay in REACQ.
Say again, please.
Could you give us some REACQ angles?
Wilco.
Say again.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. I hadn't said anything at that time. We're digging some angles out for you now. In reference to your earlier question about the sleep cycle juggling and so forth: we agree with your comment. We would like to get back on the flight plan as far as the sleep cycles and so forth are concerned by the time we get into lunar orbit. So we'd like for you to use your own judgment about the most efficient way to accommodate the sleep cycles and proportion it up among yourselves. We would like to have you keep us informed of who's doing what and what your plans are. We have the one P23 that we had slipped 2 hours. We'd like to get the other one in. We can also adjust the time for the other P23, if it's going to conflict - I guess that's two more P23's. We can adjust the time for those if you'll let us know what your forecast is for when Jim will be available to take some sightings. So the big message is that we'd like to work around whatever your desires are. If you'll let us know, we'll pick some stars and some angles and have them ready for you.
Okay, Houston. The CMP will be up at 36 hours. The LMP is going to sleep now, and he'll sleep through until 40 and then I'll stagger that in and try to go to sleep around 30 to 37 so that by the time we get to day 3 we'll all be back on the same direct sleep cycle.
Okay, real fine. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. REACQ angles look like minus 45 in pitch, plus 90 in yaw, and 34 23 for the time.
Roger. Copy. This is good using REACQ because it keeps the caution and warning from going off again.
Roger. I understand that. Are you leaving the high-gain antenna on after it swings over to the reset position?
Do you have any reason for us to use the high-gain antenna?
EECOM, do you think we need that, really, very much?
Standby.
Why can we just not use the high-gain antenna for a while? Getting high bit rate on the OMNI's. Okay, let's tell them that we'll just not worry about the OMNI for a while.
Houston, this is the LMP. Before I hit the sack, could you give me a rundown on our systems the way you see them?
Okay, we'll put that together for you and we were just talking about the redundant ECS components check and we were going to put that off until everybody's had a chance to get some sleep. Trying to keep you from having going to the left-hand couch.
Oh, that would be nice. I sent Lovell under the couch, though. I've got one man sleeping under the left couch here - right couch and one man sleeping on our right couch.
Okay. I understand you've got one under and one on the right couch.
Roger. That's affirmed.
Okay. And in reference to the OMNI versus the high gain, it looks like we can live with the OMNI antennas here for several more hours, if you would like to delete the use of the high gain.
Okay. Goodnight, Houston.
Okay. Before you pitch your eyeballs there, we'd like to terminate the battery charge.
I knew you guys would get me.
Got you.
Okay. The battery A charge is terminated at 37.3 volts.
Okay. Thank you.
Standing by for your systems status.
Okay. We're pulling that together now.
How are the PU valve and SPS line temps looking?
Okay, I'll test that.
We just had ... I understand.
Systems look okay to you Houston?
Okay, Apollo 8. All the systems - giving a quick look around the room - look real fine. You've got an RCS quad update on the quantity, so you have that information. The SPS oxidizer feed-line temperature and the fuel temperature are both at 73 degrees. The cryo profile is running right on the line: Battery A - our calculations have 39.63 amp hours. Battery B, 37.94, and battery Charlie, 38.46. The COMM continues to be running ahead of predictions in quality and circuit margins. Everything else looks like it's real fine.
Roger. Do you expect to have a low bit rate voice on the DSE off the OMNI's at lunar distances?
That's negative on DSE off the OMNI's. Not looking forward to that much improvement.
Roger. We need about a 30-foot dish, I figure, for that on the spacecraft.
Roger. It runs up the fuel required for PTC, though, Bill.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 8.
Okay. I know you're trying to be quiet, so I'll just read up some information to you. One of the things that we just turned up that might give you some confidence, if you lose oxygen cryo tank now: you have 80 pounds remaining now at CM/SM SEP. The limiting factor on single tank operation right now is the hydrogen tank which has a positive margin at CM/SM SEP, assuming our standard profile gives you about 143 hours. So it looks like you are over the hill on those. Notice that you're flying in the rate 2 position for you BMAG|BMAGS which is fine. Only make sure that you still were maintaining a PTC attitude. Looks like you're pretty close to it.
Roger. We are flying PTC, and I was wondering why it was going out of the deadband; now I know. Thank you.
Okay. Thank you.
That's what happens when you let Anders fly. He's asleep so he can't defend himself.
Roger. But we've got it on tape though.
Good. They're both conked out; how about just filling me in on some news, and I'll keep quiet just to give me some words on what's going on in the world.
Okay. Give me a few minutes to collect some data, and we'll do that.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
I'm going to have a maneuver PAD and --
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
I read you loud and clear, Apollo. 8. How me?
Apollo 8. Houston.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 8. Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, loud and clear.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Apollo 8, Houston. I believe we've lost our uplink. I'm transmitting in the blind. Read you loud and clear.
Houston, Apollo 8. Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Read you loud and clear. We may have some uplink problems; transmitting in the blind, at this time. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Hawaii Network GOSS Conference. How do you read?
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, I read you loud and clear. How me?
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Hawaii M&O. This is Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
Okay. Thank you, Hawaii. How do you read?
Hawaii, Houston Network. Voice check on GOSS Conference.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Hawaii LOS. Unable to find.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Hawaii, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Houston CAP COM, Hawaii.
Hawaii, Houston CAP COM. I would like to have a voice check.
Roger. I read you loud and clear.
Okay. I'm reading you loud and clear. I understand you have contact with the spacecraft. Is that affirm?
I have uplink voice to the spacecraft; the downlink is too low in the mud.
Okay. Understand that you have good uplink, but your downlink is in the mud. You don't have any way of copying it either, is that correct --
Houston, Apollo 8. ... again. How do you read?
That is affirmative.
Okay, Hawaii, we can hear Apollo 8, calling down. Would you answer and tell them that we did copy that?
Roger.
Apollo 8, Hawaii M&O. Houston reports they copied your last.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Hawaii, Houston Network, GOSS Conference.
Hawaii, Houston Network, GOSS Conference. Your NET 2.
Houston Network, Hawaii.
Roger. Did you copy the CAP COM?
Affirm. We copied the CAP COM.
Is he keying the transmitters out there?
He did key it one time, Network.
Okay. I'm going to ask him to call the spacecraft again, and I would like for you to give me a report if he does not key the transmitters.
Roger, Network. Is our NET 1 now conferenced up --
Your NET 2 is conferenced to our GOSS Conference here.
Roger. How about our GOSS Conference loop?
Your GOSS Conference loop is dead.
Roger. We are GO for command. We were unable to transmit before.
Understand.
We transmitted to the spacecraft as per CAP COM and they acknowledged our transmission.
Apollo 8. Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. We got back together again. You're loud and clear. We've been reading you. We have a problem down here on the ground getting our signal from MCC out to remote site.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8. Houston. I've got a ball score for you. It was Oakland 41, Kansas City 6 is the final score. That's 41 to 6, Oakland. We're trying to get some news releases over here for you. I suspect we're going to find that the staged TV show was probably the biggest news of the day.
I'm sorry that the TV lens broke down.
Well, we're working on that some more. I'm not sure that the whole thing is lost yet. It appears that our problem is one where the light intensity which is sensed by our light meter in there is picking up an average field which is much larger than the earth, and so it's sensing a great deal of deep space environment which is dark, and we're suspicious that this is probably opening up the lens aperture as wide as it will go, and then when you point the camera at the earth while the earth is only filling about 3 degrees of cone angle, whereas lens takes in 9. So it looks like you're probably just saturating the tube. Now we're playing around now with some --
We just lost you again, Houston.
Say again.
I just lost your last transmission; you were clipped.
0kay. Did you get any of my comments about the TV tube?
Roger. Got them.
Okay. What I - what we've got in mind here is that we are looking at some of the lenses you have on board for cameras, and we are going to see if one of them can possibly be used to attenuate some of this light so that you will be able to take one of these pictures, and we are running some tests now, and we'll let you know about those. I also have a maneuver PAD that I need to read up to you whenever it's convenient.
Let me get a pencil. Be fine right now.
Okay.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. The first one I will give you is a TLI plus 44 maneuver PAD. I will start reading down the left-hand column. TLI plus 44, SPS/G&N 62970, minus 162, plus 129 046:56:04.31, plus 00197, plus all zeros, plus 607 01 180 133, 001 November Alfa, plus 002 03 607 01 704 604 51 12 1375 349.
Boresight star is earth, down 037, right 22, plus 10 68, minus 165 00 128 56 361 18 098:27:17. The GDC alignment stars: the primary star is Sirius, secondary Rigel 010, 294, 320, no ullage, path return P37 ΔV|DELTA-V, 8750. This goes to the Indian Ocean and requires a high-speed procedure, that is minus Mike Alfa, and that will refer to your checklist page November Charlie 1. Over.
Okay, Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear.
TLI plus 44, SPS/G&N 62970, minus 162, plus 129 046:56:04.31, plus 00197, plus all zeros, plus 60701 180 133 001, plus 00203, plus 60701 704 60451 12 1375 349; earth, down 037, right 2.2, plus 1068, minus 165 12856 36118 098:27:17; Sirius and Rigel. Hello, Houston. How do you read now?
Loud and clear.
Sirius and Rigel, 010 294 320, no ullage, path return P37 ΔV|DELTA-V 8750, Indian Ocean minus MA, checklist NC 1.
That's affirmative, Apollo 8. And I have a flyby PAD for you, also.
Go ahead.
Okay. This flyby PAD is an update to one that we gave you yesterday so you might want to note that this is the second one. And it will be a flyby SPS/G&N; 62970, minus 162, plus 129 060:59:48.07, plus 00966, plus 00552, minus 02079. Roll, pitch, and yaw are all zeros, November Alfa, perigee height plus 00202 02358 022 02281 03 0407 317 013, up 047, right 39, plus 1418 minus 16505 12904 36160 146:29:12, primary star Sirius, secondary Rigel, 136 310 340, no ullage, requires realignment to preferred REFSMMAT. This burn will raise perilune to 550 miles. Over.
Okay, Houston. The second flyby SPS/G&N. Are you with me?
Yes sir.
62970, minus 162, plus 129 060:59:48.07, plus 00966, plus 00552, minus 02079. Next three are all zeros, NA, plus 00202 02358 022 02281 03 0407 317 013, up 04.7, right 3.9, plus 1418, minus 16505, plus 12904, plus 36160 146:29:12. Sirius, Rigel, 136 310 340, none, requires realignment to preferred REFSMMAT. Pericynthian to 550 miles.
That's correct, Apollo 8.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Okay. The CMP is now up. We'll proceed with the 52 option and start on the cislunar navigation.
Okay. Thank you, and we'll start looking for some star data.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. When you pick up your activities, I have a preferred alignment here that I want you to be in when you do your P52, and I'll have about four items to change on your time lines, so if you give me a call when you're ready for it.
We're ready right now. We were doing the P52. You want to hold off and go to a particular alignment, is that right?
Affirmative.
All right. I'm ready.
Okay. The attitude is pitch 23.4, roll 184.7, yaw 14.3. And the reason we're doing the alignment in this attitude is, the next thing we'll be coming up with is the scanning telescope visibility test and that will be 70 degrees sun and Arcturus with a shaft and trunnion of zero. and then we can go ahead with the P52 and then a trunnion bias followed by P23 with the same stars we read to you before.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're maneuvering to the angles you - you gave us.
All right. Thank you.
Houston, we've reached the preferred attitude, and we're proceeding with the P52.
Okay. Real fine, and I'll pass up some advice from your friendly flight surgeon. He says you're supposed to take one more Lomotil.
Okay. Everybody, or just me?
Just Frank.
Thank you.
Houston, the P52 is completed. We're ready for your other data.
Okay. Understand that you've done the P52. The next item on the flight plan should be a scanning telescope visibility test, and this is the same one that was on your flight plan previously at 34 hours and about 12 minutes, and we'll be checking that 70 degree sun's on Arcturus. Following that, we need to make a trunnion bias check, and then we'll go into a P23, and I can read you those star numbers and sets if you don't have them from the last time I read them up.
Okay. Standby.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. With such good visibility or such good communications, we'll just give you a verbal description without seeing the scanning telescope right now. Your angles for maneuvering to Arcturus were quite good. I've got Arcturus centered in the scanning telescope. At this sun angle, there is a shaft of light directly across the center of the scanning telescope and - band of light. It precludes seeing a lot of stars around us, and although I kept my eye glued to the telescope now for some time, it's very difficult to see any star patterns or anything. I couldn't recognize that with Arcturus unless I - the optics just drove me there. Now because I'm near zero shaft and zero trunnion, I'm getting quite a bit of shaft movement. Everytime the shaft moves, more particles leave the optics, and they're just as bright as the surrounding stars. And they mingle in the stars, and you can't tell star patterns or constellations. With this particular attitude, the shaft of light precludes any identification of constellations or individual stars.
Okay. Copy that. Can you tell us something about the orientation of this band? You mentioned that last night also - that you also had a band about 10 degrees wide that ran across. Is there an orientation that we can tie that to?
I believe so, Ken. This band is parallel to the M-line, and I think it has something to do with the design of the optics where we have that shaft or the rectangular entrance of the optics from the outside. At this particular sun angle, it cuts right across. Now I noticed that both the earth and the sun do this to the scanning telescope. In the sextant, the same light band is there, although it covers the entire sextant's field of view. However, the magnification brings out the stars quite well, and it is possible to mark on it. But the identification of the stars with the scanning telescope makes it very difficult. Now the attitude that I found the optics are best at are the attitudes which give the constellations Canis Major and Orion in the scanning telescope. At this, this particular attitude of the spacecraft, the band is gone; we're at a position whereby the sun is behind us, and I can see quite a few stars. Now yesterday I could also, after getting dark-adapted, see quite a few stars around the constellation Cassiopeia which at first I couldn't. But right now this band precludes you see anything at all except Arcturus which, of course, I know we're aiming at right now.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Ken, what stars did you want to use? Did you want to read them off?
Okay. First star will be 26, and we'll be making two sets of measurements, earth near-horizon using star 26. Then we would like to have one set on star 16, that's 16, using the earth far-horizon. If it turns out that star 26 earth near-horizon is not possible, then we'd like to have star 16 on the earth far-horizon for one set, and star 22 earth far-horizon one set. Over.
You want star 26, earth near-horizon, two sets; star 16, earth far-horizon, one set; and star 22, earth far-horizon, one set.
Okay. That's star 22 only in the event that 26 on the earth's near horizon is not possible? Over.
We won't even do star 22 then unless we can't get 26 on the near horizon.
That's affirmative.
COMM sure is good all of a sudden, isn't it?
Yes, this is outstanding.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Okay, we have completed two sets on 26 and one set on 16.
Roger. Getting pretty speedy there.
Jim is getting to know the objects.
Are you receiving the data, Houston?
Affirmative.
Okay.
Keeping you honest.
Right.
Okay, Apollo 8. We have looked at the data and it looks good and they feel like you can go back to PTC attitude anytime you are ready to. And if you can - go ahead.
What attitude do you want to use? The same one?
That's affirmative.
Thank you.
Okay, if you can reach over Bill there and get to panel 3, I believe we would like to cycle the oxygen fans. And also like to get the BIOMED switch over to CMP.
Okay.
If you have to bother Bill to do that, why, we can hold off on the cryo fans.
No, he moved. We already chased him under the seat. Okay, now you want just the oxygen fans on?
That's affirm. Turn one on for about 2 minutes and when we turn it off, then we will turn the next one on. We don't want to turn them on simultaneously though.
I know that. I mean you don't want hydrogen though?
That's affirmative. Just the oxygen.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Ken, just recap a little explanation here on your maneuver PAD, something which I'm really not knowledgeable about, the way it was presented to us, you mentioned fast return P37 ΔV|DELTA-V of 8750, just briefly clarify that, will you please?
Okay, stand by.
Ken, can you give us a little report on how our trajectory looks and the tracking is going and things like that?
Okay, sure will. I will put a summary together here.
And the pericynthian sign.
Roger, we will get all that together for you in just a few minutes.
And we never did get the news.
You are the news.
Come off it, come off it.
Okay, the fans have been cycled 2 minutes each and they are back off.
Okay, thank you very much.
Houston, Apollo 8 is back in the PTC attitude, reads MHPTC.
Okay, thank you. And in reference to your question about the P37 ΔV|DELTA-V, 8750, that's the number that goes into the option at P37 for your minimum time return. That gives you a target for the Indian Ocean. And in this case, we are going to have to use the high-speed procedures that were worked out for you to use some minus number for the major axis.
Roger. Understand. I'm going to give that a try, Ken, in a run through. I tried it yesterday, I wasn't getting too much in the way of results. I will give it a try today.
Okay. And on the - your tracking that we have now, it still looks like the time we gave you last night for time of pericynthian is still good, 69 plus 10 and right now your flyby earth pericynthian altitude is 65.8. Looks like the midcourse number 3 is going to be something less than 1 foot-per-second. And all trajectory parameters are still holding real fine.
That's the things we like to hear. We would like to keep those holding very much.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. We're getting near - we're going to need to dump some urine overboard here. I wonder if that's going to foul your trajectory up. Or can we go ahead and do it?
No, that's okay. Something that is kind of interesting though is that the last time you had your water dump, they noticed a change in the trajectory tracking at the same time and they got through correlating it, they found some fellow that thought he knew the characteristics of a nozzle and how much water you're dumping and his estimates of the effect on the trajectory seemed to coincide with the tracked results. So I guess you have to stay onto some of those things.
Roger. Okay. We'll go ahead and dump it.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger. Go ahead.
You planning on using our computer any time in the near future, I thought I'd do a little P37.
Apollo 8, Houston. You can go ahead and run that 37 and we're going to kind of watch that from the ground, too, and see how it works out. A couple of items that are just of general interest in the trajectory world. Looks like the uncertainty in position was about 12 miles. Your uncertainty in velocity is about a quarter of a foot per second. And the perigee altitude of uncertainty is 5 miles.
Roger. Understand. Just for information, perhaps you read it out on the ground. I ran our pericynthian altitude determination using first of all, P21. The star state vector that we navigated with, we have plus 84.7 mile altitude and then we ran out your state vector that you updated with us the last time. We got 64.2 and then I ran P30, using our state vector and got 82.6 nautical miles. These are all plus.
That's good.
What I'm going to attempt to do on P37 is to input your ΔV|DELTA-V on your TLI plus 44 and use that 44 burn time. I notice that the entry velocity is a little high. We might not be able to do a normal P37, but we'll give it a try.
Roger.
Houston, one more question then before I start. Did you notice on this last update PAD, this minus MA NC-1. Was that referring to the P37 fast return or the nominal maneuver which you gave me?
Apollo 8, that's referring to the fast return procedures.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Are you following my procedure?
That's affirmative.
Okay. This happened yesterday, too. I'm trying to load the ΔV|DELTA-V you gave us in the maneuver TLI plus 44 in P37, but I keep getting an operator error everytime I try to load zeros for the termination of the middle and corner. Do you know what I'm doing wrong in my procedure?
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Okay, go ahead. I can take it.
Okay, looks like the decimal point in R2 under NOUN 60 is on the extreme right-hand side so the proper load will be 06070. Over.
Ah, so. Okay, fine. Thank you. I'll update my checklist. Don't know what I want to update it for, I can't read.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are about to hand over to another site so you may lose lock momentarily.
Roger, Houston. Did you receive the results of the P37?
Sure did. Looks pretty good here.
I concur.
Apollo 8; Houston through Honeysuckle. The switch is completed.
You are loud and clear.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Another comment on the optics. We're in PTC right now. We are passing the - we have the roll of about 182; we're about in 226 pitch and 18 in yaw. I can rotate the shaft all the way around at this particular attitude, and I get this band of light at about 10 degrees of this side of the M-line. It - it varies in intensity with the shaft position. However, it is there at this particular attitude.
Okay. Thank you.
Jim, we have just been looking at your marks with respect to accuracy and they figure they are within a couple of thousandths of a degree of the theoretical optimum. The integrator seems to bear that out.
Well, I hope that they are enough to get us home if we have to use them.
Well, I am getting a lot of confidence in your ability to run that mystery show now.
Hey, Jim, we have to spend four more days up here with him, will you take it easy. He is already talking about going back to MIT as a professor.
(Laughter)
Hello, Houston. How do you read Apollo 8?
Oh, loud and clear.
You sure do sound wide awake.
Hello, Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Honeysuckle network, GOSS CONFERENCE. How do you read?
Houston, this is Apollo 8. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
Go ahead Honeysuckle. How do you read?
Well, I would like to say hello to all of you in Australia. How is everything down there?
Pretty good so far. Thank you.
Honeysuckle, Houston network, on GOSS CONFERENCE. How do you read?
Houston network, this is Honeysuckle reading at 5, 5.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger, just checking with you. Hey, if you all start having ground switching problems, how about having some place that has COMM come in and tell us about it. Will you please?
Roger. Apollo 8. That's what we have been trying to do. Some of our problem seems to be getting from here to that site.
Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. How me?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We read you loud and clear and copy your remarks about having our remote site talk to you. Some of our problem has been in going from MCC to the remote site. We will attempt to do that anytime we can.
That's right. Just tell them you are having problems.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Reading you weak but clear.
Okay. Thank you, Jerry.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Roger, Frank. I've got a little news and some ball scores if you want them.
Go ahead.
Okay. The big news right now, on the wires, is that all 82 crewmen of the Pueblo have been returned. They walked across the Bridge of Freedom Monday night.
Wonderful!
Said it took about 30 minutes for all 82 men to come across the Bridge of No Return and that's the one separating North and South Korea. They started across about 11:30 a.m. and were over by about noon, and they brought the body of the crewman that was killed, also.
Okay, Frank. On ball scores, did you get the word on the Baltimore and Minnesota game today?
Not the final one.
Okay. Final score was the Colts 24, Vikings 14. That gives them the western conference, so it looks like for the NFL title it's gonna be the Browns versus the Colts on the 29th.
29th?
Roger. Slow return - you'll get it.
Say again.
Roger. Come back slow return and we'll get it.
I'd rather come back fast and watch it on television.
Atta boy! Let's see, for the AFL: the big game today was Oakland and Kansas City and Oakland dumped them 41 to 6, so it's looks the AFL title game will be the Raiders and Jets.
Righto! That's hard to believe, that score.
Amen! Okay. In yesterday's game, I don't know it you got the score on that. The Cleveland Browns and the Cowboys. The Browns dumped the Cowboys 31 to 20.
Yes, we heard that.
Yes, they're crying in Dallas. Basketball scores: Houston didn't do so good this weekend. Illinois beat Houston 97 to 84. And North Carolina took the Owls. The score was 85 to 77. We had a couple of words in the paper, Frank, on the Oilers. The Oilers voted George Webster their most valuable player and - although Houston didn't make anybody on the All Offensive Team this year, they put Walt Suggs and Hoyle Granger on the second team.
Very good.
But although the Oilers didn't do so well out on the field, they did great in the box office. Bud Adams, Don Klausterman and Wally Lemm were all - real pleased with it. By the way, they were at the Cape to watch the show. Houston in 11 games - the Oilers attracted 460 628 people.
That must be a record? For them? I don't believe they ever got that many in Rice Stadium.
I think so. Let's see the regular season attendance was about half that. This includes all the exhibition games. The paper says they averaged about 40 480 for the league games.
Great!
Well, that's about it for now, Frank. We got some more news that they promised they would bring over as soon as it comes off the wire. The only thing of real interests were - particularly the Pueblo release. I think you've already been told about the - Nixon-Eisenhower wedding. And about the only other thing is the weather which is pretty clear around here. We've got high overcasts. But it is cold, good visibility, and it's beginning to feel like winter again.
Good time for Christmas, good weather for Christmas.
Who have you got up now, Frank?
The other two guys are pretty sleepy. They sacked out again. So I am holding the fort down for a while.
Okay. Thanks.
Roger. Thank you.
Frank, we had a little egg nog over at Charlie Duke's tonight.
Say again.
We had a little egg nog at Charlie Duke's tonight. Val Anders dropped by. She's looking fine. Tell Bill she's doing real fine.
Fine.
How do you like shift work, Jerry?
It's great Frank. You've got the black watch watching you tonight.
Yes, that's what I figured.
Boy, Jerry. That earth is sure looking small.
Roger. I guess it'll get smaller, too.
Yes, we're getting along pretty good, though, now.
Real good. It looks like you're approaching 150 000 miles.
Roger.
How does the moon look, Frank?
Say again.
Have you looked at the moon lately?
No. I saw it yesterday, but we haven't seen it today.
Frank, you've probably already been told this, but you looked great on TV today. One little homey item, though. In the El Lago area you were upstaged by Santa Claus. He came along on a fire engine just about the time you guys came along. So most of the little critters were all outside.
That's good. I wish we could have got that one lens working. I'd like to share the view here we have of the earth.
Frank, we've got some guys looking at it. We might be able to find a way to make it work for you. Hopefully, by a couple of hours before TV time tomorrow, we'll have an answer.
Very good.
Jack Schmitt is working with us, too.
Very good.
Ah, Jack Schmitt's working with it, too.
Very good. That's Typhoid Jack.
(Laughter)
This COMM so good we don't figure we'll have much to debrief.
Roger. Probably the biggest part of the debrief will be the medical part.
Roger. You're sure right. Oh, we're all in fine shape.
Real fine, Frank.
Houston, Apollo 8. We have just completed the canister change.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We have a handover coming up in 2-1/2 minutes to Guam. Over.
Okay, Jerry. Thank you. Hey, Jerry?
Go ahead.
How about a long-range guess on what the weather is going to be like in the recovery area on Friday.
Roger, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston, with a weather watch.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. For 7 degrees, 38 minutes north, 165 west landing area, we are showing 2000 scattered, 12 000 broken, high over at 10; the wind's from the east at 12, 4-foot swells, about an 82 degree temperature. There will be some rain showers in about 10 to 30 percent of the area with ceilings around 2000. If there is - turns out to be a thunderstorm in the area, it will probably have a ceiling around 500 feet.
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you copy that weather okay?
Roger. I said thank you. Do you read me now?
Roger. Reading you much better. We got the voice coming down through Honeysuckle now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. Can you cycle the H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> cryo fans now for us?
Roger. Will turn her now, the H<sub>2</sub>. Manual - 2 minutes.
Roger.
You may need to call us now and then. Everybody is a little drowsy.
Okay, Frank.
That completes it, Jerry. They're all cycled through.
Roger, Frank.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
Did you get my message about the fans?
Sure did, Frank. Thanks.
Okay.
Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. The cabin temperature is down to 60, and it's getting pretty chilly in here. Have you got any approved solutions on how to bring it up without stirring up this nice thermal balance we have?
Roger. Stand by.
Frank, do you have your cabin fans on?
Negative.
Roger.
We haven't had them on since we separated.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Frank. Midcourse number 3 looks like just a shade more than 1 foot per second, so we don't recommend that you do it. That leads us off into a midcourse 4 of only about 3 feet per second right now. Your trajectory is looking real good. Your height at pericynthian is 70 miles.
Roger. Understand. Thank you.
Roger. Roger, Frank. Little few thoughts on what is coming up now. The star sightings when Jim gets up; looks right now like we've had enough of the earth horizon, and everything looks real good; and we are ready to start on some lunar horizon sightings. So when Jim gets up, we will pass the flight plan update to him for a set of stars with the moon. Also, around 48, or after the star sightings is when we would like to see your next water dump come up. So, if you can, I recommend you get a little shuteye.
Roger. Have you got any answer about warming this place up a little bit?
Roger. They are still cranking around. They are talking about cabin fans, but that sounds like sort of a noisy proposition.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. I have got two methods for you to warm up the cabin there. The first one is a one-man job - about the best way would be to put one or both cabin fans ON and go full hot on the cabin heat exchanger. It'll be a fairly slow process of warming up, and you won't get a whole lot of heating. Your second method would be to adjust with the mixing valve your radiator OUT temperatures. This, again, is a two-man job, and you have to be pretty careful.
Roger. Well, Frank just went to bed, and Bill isn't up yet. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll put on the fans and go HIGH on the cabin temperature and see what that does.
Okay, Jim. Remember, if you use just one fan, cover the other.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. If I use just one fan - You mentioned about covering the other one - are you sure that's true in this spacecraft?
Roger. That's affirmative.
I thought that was a BLOCK I problem.
Stand by, Jim. We'll recheck on that one.
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you get the word from Frank on the star-sighting plans?
Roger. I'll get out the flight plan if you have an update to it now, though, then we can update it right now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Are you ready for that flight plan update?
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. At 47:15, delete the P23 sightings you're shoving there; and at 45 minutes - correction, 45 hours, add one additional set of sightings to each star.
Okay. You said at 45 hours we're going to add one set of sightings to each of the three stars. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. Everybody's real pleased with the earth horizon work; and as far as we're concerned, you can knock that off, and just add one set to each one of your lunar horizon stars at about 45. This 45-hour time also is not hard. You can shift it as your - as you desire.
Roger. I see things coming up now. Jerry, we're going to get the block data around 44, and we'll do alignment around 44:30 and then we'll go into cislunar navigation.
Okay. Fine, Jim. Then remember after you do the sightings, we'll want you to go back to the PTC mode again. And a little curiosity, how's the water tasting, and how did you sleep?
Water's tasting okay; no problems. And the sleep is getting better: We find it better to sleep underneath the couch now. I was up here with Frank, and I was dozing off periodically over the last several hours. Frank's now below and Bill's below, too.
Okay, Jim; thanks.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, we've got a command handover from Guam to Honeysuckle coming up in about 2 and 1/2 minutes.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8. This is Flight -
... at this distance --
Say again, Apollo 8.
... at this distance, there is no problem - there is no problem in seeing stars in the daylight at this distance.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Flight.
This is 8; go ahead.
Jim, are you talking about out the window or out any of the - or out the telescope?
I am looking out the window right now. I have the lights out in the spacecraft, the window covered where the sun is, and I can see the stars very well out the left rendezvous window.
Okay. I guess that window is still pretty good for you then.
That's right. It is one of the few that is. The center window, unfortunately, is all fogged over; it looks like a coating of ice or coating of heavy fog. Bill claims it is something else, though.
Roger. By the way, I am just getting OJT on this CAP COM job while Jerry is out of the room.
Well, we all have to learn sometime.
Yes sir.
You picked a midnight shift, I see.
Yes, it is turning out to be kind of quiet, too.
We like it that way.
Well, things will pick up here by tomorrow night, I think.
I believe you are right.
We're starting to show cabin temperature at 70, so it may be warming up for you.
Well, we can feel it warm up. I have both fans on and the - our gages indicate about 70.
Okay. And I have got a real CAP COM back now.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Apollo 8. This is Houston, with a flyby, and a PC, pericynthian plus 2 hours maneuver PAD, when you are ready to copy.
Ready to copy.

Roger, Jim. That's all correct.
Apollo 8, Houston. That PC plus 2 is a fast return.
Roger. Understand. Fast return.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Just some interesting things on the - just done a NAV with the moon; the sun is currently right in the way. I managed to get one set on Antares and was working on the second set, and the rim of the moon just disappeared completely. The view through the sextant is a milky white, whether you're looking at black sky or the moon. The tint of the moon is slightly washed out by the brightness of the sun. I'll try the next star and see what I can do with it.
Roger, Jim.
Good morning, Houston. How are the systems looking here lately?
Mornin', sleepy head. Systems are looking GO.
Thank you.
How'd you sleep, Bill?
Oh, off and on, Jerry. There was quite a bit of noise in here, and anytime somebody responds to a transmission, why, it tends to wake you up. But it was a reasonably good rest.
Real fine. We got a little work scheduled for you here. We've got an ECS redundant component check to run and some fuel cell purging to do.
Okay. How about if we wait until this NAV exercise is over with?
Roger.
Bill, what we have planned for you right after Jim gets finished is a waste water dump, a cryo fan cycle, redundant component check, and a fuel cell purge.
Roger.
We'll be wanting an O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge; we'll give you a 20-minute hack on the heater.
Okay. Want me to turn them on now or when you give me a hack?
You better wait about 20 minutes.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Bill, are you still eating?
Doing what?
Are you busy eating?
Negative. I'm watching the store while Jim does his NAV sighting and then recording the data for him.
Okay. We have a correction to make to your TLI plus 44 hour PAD. If you've got a chance there, we'd like to fire it on up to you.
Stand by.
Roger.
Okay. Ready to copy the correction to TLI plus 44.
Roger. The correction is in the remarks at the end. Delete the reference to high speed procedure minus MA.
Roger. Delete minus MA slash NC-1, Charlie.
That's affirmative, and copy the following. This comment should read use P37 NC-4, step 1 through 11. Over.
Roger. Use P37 NC-4, steps 1 through 11.
Roger. Then proceed to longitude control for no COMM procedure, page NC-7.
You went a little fast. Say again the page.
Roger, That page is NC-7. I'll read that again. Then proceed to longitude control for no COMM procedure, page NC-7. Average 400k, V 400K, for corridor control charts is 36253. I repeat, average V 400K for corridor control charts is 36253. Over.
Roger. Say again. That's average G as in George.
Negative. Average Victor 400K for corridor control chart is 36253.
Roger. Average V 400K for corridor control chart is 36253.
Roger. The minus MA procedure is okay after abort when the GERU is less than 07990.
Roger. Minus MA procedure okay for abort when GERU less than 07990.
Roger. I'll read back the entire remarks now just to make sure we got it straight. Use P37 NC-4, steps 1 through 11; then proceed to longitude control for no COMM procedure on page NC-7; average Victor 400K for corridor control chart is 36253; Minus MA procedure is okay after abort when GERU is less than 07990.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Bill, you can turn on the H<sub>2</sub> purge line heater now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Jim, when you get a chance, either you or Bill, would you give us a crew status report on you and Bill?
Roger. We're going to finish up this one set of stars for you, then we'll do that.
Okay.
Have you been getting this data down there in Houston?
That's affirmative, Apollo 8.
Jim, so far we've only missed one point; we'll ask you to read it back a little bit later.
Which one do you need?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. What we need is the third mark on the first set, star 33, trunnion only. Over.
Roger. That's the only one we're in doubt of. We think it was 12020.
Roger. Copy.
Okay. That completes two for this time, Houston. Are you satisfied?
Roger, Jim.
Houston, for information, the last two stars, 34 and 40, were shot at the very tip of the lit rim. You practically have to imagine the rim continued on past where it goes into the darkness.
Roger. I understand they were shot at the tip of the lit rim.
That's affirmative, and the area around the entire moon now, both the sky and the moon itself, are all a milky white because of the nearness of the sun.
Roger. Copying.
Apollo 8, Houston. You can reestablish PTC same attitude, 224 and 20.
Roger, Houston. I'm heading that way now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
We'd like to have you start your waste water dump as soon as you can; dump to 20 percent. We're doing this in order to get 71 percent at LOI. Over.
Understand; 20 percent.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We see waste water coming down now. While it's on its way down, how about a cryo fan cycle?
Okay. Cryo fan cycle; I'll cycle H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> fans, one at a time, 2 minutes each.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing you at 20.0 percent now.
Roger. We're showing about 25. We'll shut it off now.
Roger. Next on deck is the fuel cell H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub> purge.
Stand by.
Okay. Houston, we're ready to start the purge.
Roger, Bill. While you're purging, can you give us a crew status report?
That's going to be O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>. Is that correct?
Affirmative.
Roger. H<sub>2</sub> first, okay?
Roger. That's okay.
We're getting H<sub>2</sub> flow, Jerry, but we don't have any of the - any vapor particles anywhere. Some are starting now.
Roger. We confirm your flow and understand you're seeing particles now.
Not much, though. Okay. Now going to number 2.
Roger.
You know, it's really too bad the side windows are fogged up because we never see any sun in the rendezvous windows, and we can't get very good pictures through these foggy ones.
Roger.
Start number 3. H<sub>2</sub>.
Okay. Start number 3, O<sub>2</sub>.
Roger, Apollo 8. Apollo 8, this is Houston. Would you set for ACCEPT for a P27 update, state vector to your LM side, and we'd like you to -
Say again.
Roger, Bill. Would you set up to ACCEPT a state vector update? We'll be putting it in the LM slot, and do not unzap. Over.
Roger. NORMAL ACCEPT.
We're going to put the word "zap" back in the dictionary.
Roger, Batman.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
It might be interesting to note that after NAV sightings, we ran out P21, and we get a pericynthian now of 66.8 miles.
Roger, 8. We copy.
I knew if he did it long enough, he'd finally get one that was close.
Okay. Start fuel cell 2.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Your state vector update is complete and verified. You can have the computer back in BLOCK. Over.
Roger.
Okay. Going to number 1, O<sub>2</sub>.
Roger, Bill.
Old Helmut Kuehnel's kitchen timer is pretty nice.
Roger, Bill. You can turn off your H<sub>2</sub> heaters now.
Wilco.
Bill, we show you 168 000 out, and we're getting - still getting pretty good high bit rate off the 30-foot dishes.
Okay. I'm in NARROW BEAM high gain now. Were you getting good high bit rate on the OMNI?
That's affirmative. We're back on high gain now.
Okay. Number 1 O<sub>2</sub> is off, and will you clarify your previous statement. Were you getting good high bit rate while we were on the OMNI's about 10 minutes ago? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. That's affirmative. We were getting fairly good high bit rate with a little bit of noise.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger. We only got two things left to do now. We need your crew status report and a redundant component check.
Jim will give you the latter - former, and I'll give you the latter.
Okay.
Bill, EECOM says thanks for the good job on keeping the OMNI's moving.
Roger. We'll make any sacrifice as long as they keep an eye on the systems.
Wilco.
Who's on the watch with you?
It's just me right now.
How about EECOM?
Well, we have Clint. The Black Watch is watching.
Okay. Stay alert.
Roger. The Black Watch is watching.
Roger. I'll stay alert.
Okay, Houston. Here comes the status report.
Roger. We're ready to copy.
Roger. For sleep, each of us has had two sleep periods; Frank's in his third one right now. Bill had 6 hours the last time; I had 4 hours the last time. Good to fair, both of us. Frank had 5 hours the last time, of fair. And Frank, of course, is sleeping now.
Roger, Jim. How are the three of you feeling?
We're all feeling pretty good now; no problems. We've all had about between 40 and 60 ounces of - or clicks of water so far today.
Okay.
The food: we're up to - we've eaten day 2, meal 2 so far. And both of us have eaten the rehydratables and the juices and about half of the solids.
Roger. Copy.
The cabin's running slightly cold. We do have one cabin fan ON, and we're in full heat, and it's running just slightly under 70. Might be a design note for future spacecraft.
Roger, Jim. That fan pretty noisy?
It's not as noisy as both fans when they're running; we cut it down to one fan.
Roger. We keep thinking we hear it when you're talking to us.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Houston, we're showing a glycol EVAP OUT TEMP around 44, and a RAD OUT TEMP of about 28. I wonder if we might try some manual mixing here to raise the glycol EVAP TEMP OUT a little bit?
Roger, Bill. Stand by.
Okay. Houston, secondary loop is coming up.
Roger, Bill.
Okay. We're boiling the secondary EVAP, and the temperature's stabilized, and so we're gonna close up the EVAP pressure valve.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Bill. Before you try the manual mixing, we'd like you to give it a whirl at the manual and increase on the cabin TEMP. Over.
We've done that. We're in full HOT, and what is your - what's the lowest RAD OUT - individual RAD OUT TEMP you seen here during our PTC?
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We saw 26 one time.
Roger. Understand; plus 26.
Affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead with your manual mixing. Suggest you set your EVAP OUT at about 55. Over.
Okay. We'll give that a try, and let us know if the RAD OUT TEMPs get too low.
Roger. We're monitoring.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We have it stabilized about 53 degrees, and we will leave it there, but we will go back AUTO if you start having any concern about the radiators.
Roger, Bill. We are showing 51.4 here.
Okay.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are going to have a command changeover to Honeysuckle in about 2 minutes. Over.
Roger, Houston. Standing by.
Apollo 8, Houston. That was Honeysuckle to Madrid.
Si, señor.
Goodbye, you chaps.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Did you delete the cislunar NAV exercise at 47:15?
That's affirmative, and we added the extra star sightings to the one at 45.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Buenas dias, muchachos.
Buenas dias. We're going to be answering your calls pretty quietly for a little while here to let the CDR get to sleep. If you can't hear us, why, just tell us so.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. My two cohorts are going to try and get some sleep here, so y'all might keep a good eye on the systems. I'm going to move over to the other side.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're getting low bit rate now. We could do better with a high-gain antenna before you move over to the other side. Over.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
You might give me a call every now and then, Jerry, just to let me know you're still there, as we're switching antennas, or play some music or something.
Say again, Bill. You're kind of garbled.
I say you might just give me a call every now and then as we switch antennas, just to let me know you're still there, or play some music or something, just to make sure we haven't lost COMM.
Okay, Bill. Your antennas are looking good now.
Hey, Bill. If you want music, I'll have Mike sing.
Ask him to sing "Anchors Aweigh", will you?
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger.
On your secondary coolant loop, looks like your back-pressure valve might be slightly open. I suggest you go to secondary coolant loop EVAP switch to the RESET position for 58 seconds. Over.
Roger. I did that again; I'll try it a third time.
Okay.
That didn't do it any good, Houston.
Roger, Bill.
Keep an eye on it, in case it starts dropping. It stabilized there right after I shut the evaporator off.
Roger. We will watch it.
What might have happened, Jim might have gotten the water control valve off before we completely had the back-pressure valve closed.
Roger. Understand Jim turned the water control valve off.
Roger. We have the secondary water EVAP control valve off, but he might have gotten it off on that return pump chart check prior to the time the evaporator back-pressure valve had completely closed, which might explain its lower-than-nominal state pressure.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Bill. We see your secondary steam pressure coming back up slowly, and we would like to just sit and watch it for a while before doing anything else.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. I just wanted to let you know we still have voice contact, and we have the morning news for you. We can give it to you now or some time later, your choice.
How about right now?
Very good. This is the 23rd of December edition of the Interstellar Times a la Paul Haney. We would like to let you know that there are only 2 more shopping days until Christmas. He says your TV transmission was a real big hit yesterday. Mickey Herskowitz is doing double duty for the Post. He's written a couple of columns on your launch in addition to his other sports columns, and, Jim, your mom certainly appreciated that birthday greeting. Twenty-one convicts broke out of a prison in New Orleans yesterday, and President Johnson went home last night from Bethesda Naval Hospital after his bout with the flu. He sends you guys a special message - not what to do for the flu - but congratulations on the flight. Are you reading me so far okay?
You're very clear, Mike.
Good. Well, we had a big blizzard down here in the midwest; I don't know if you can see that from up there or not. And in Houston, as a matter of fact, it's getting pretty chilly, about 35 degrees. And we would like to know who you like next Sunday, Baltimore or Cleveland? Baltimore defense looked pretty tremendous yesterday. They put on great pass rush, and it sounds to CAP COM like Haney is trying to con you guys into a bet. Over.
I like Baltimore.
Are you giving points?
Negative. I don't bet.
I guess you don't if you don't give points.
Not with you anyway.
Okay. That's about the size of the news. Houston, standing by.
How are the families doing, Mike?
They are doing just great, Bill; just talking to Valerie a few minutes ago.
That was Frank.
Oh, well, likewise with Susan. I have not talked to her since last night.
Roger.
Mike, this is Frank again. Would you tell the doctors I got about 5 hours of good sleep yesterday?
Roger. Thank you, Frank; we were wondering about that, about 5 hours of good sleep.
Right.
How is everything going up there, Frank; all three of you guys feeling okay this morning?
Feel fine. Jim went back to sleep. Bill and I are having breakfast and everything seems fine.
Good; glad to hear it.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Just checking in with you after about a 45 minute quiet break. Say, we notice on your high-gain antenna, if you like, you can get a little bit more use out of it by switching to it from OMNI when you have a yaw angle of 90 degrees and a pitch angle of minus 45 degrees. We are noticing that you are staying an extra 10 minutes on the OMNI, which is fine; but you could get more use out of the high gain if you use that procedure. Over.
Okay, thank you. It's a lot simpler for us, as long as the OMNI isn't working. We've got it all wrapped up here on the eight ball with the roll ... pointing to an OMNI number. We just switch it; it makes it a lot easier, if it is not bothering you.
Okay. That is fine. We are presently happy with the COMM, Frank. We are just trying to be helpful.
Thank you very much. It's unusual that Mike Collins tries to be helpful, but nevertheless, thank you very much.
Good; aerospace first, Frank.
Say hello to Howard Tindall for us, will you? His procedure seemed to be working.
Sure will.
I hope that you have got everybody looking this thing over very carefully. One thing we want is a perfect spacecraft before we consider the LOI burn.
Apollo 8, Houston. We concur, and we are doing that.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8. The water is in the process of being chlorinated at this time.
Roger. Understand you're chlorinating the water at this time.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
At your convenience, we would like the readout of your service module RCS propellant quantities. We haven't gotten one of those so far this flight.
Alright. Stand by. We are just about to - need to change the antenna. I'll give them to you.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Okay. A, service module A, you ready?
Ready to copy.
The temperature is about 111, the helium pressure - Do you just want the quantity, or do you want the whole works?
Well, if you are reading, give us the whole works.
Okay. The helium pressure is about 37, the manifold is 182, and the quantity is reading 80. B has got the temperature about 112, the helium pressure about 36.5, the fuel pressure 180, and the quantity about 77. C has got the temperature of 140 - incidentally, those other temperatures should have been 120 instead of 110; I was looking at the wrong calibration here. The pressure is 37, the manifold pressure is about 182, and the quantity is 80. Temperature on D is 115, pressure is 37, the manifold pressure is 181, and the quantity is about 83.
Roger, Frank. I read you loud and clear. On the temperatures, quad A and B should both be 120. Roger.
Roger.
Thank you.
I will trade all of that good information for a readout of the actual quantities. If you will give us a minute, we will go ahead and plot them up, Mike.
Roger. We will stand by until we get them for you.
Apollo 8, Houston. I have your service module RCS quantities available. Over.
Roger. We are ready to copy at 50 hours 16 minutes.
Okay. I have them both in percent and pounds; I'll give you both numbers. The pounds are slightly more accurate for plotting on your chart. Quad A 72 percent, 219 pounds; quad B 76 percent, 233 pounds; quad C 70 --
Take it a little slower, Mike; whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.
Okay.
Slow up. We just got quad A plotted. They are on separate charts.
Okay.
Okay for quad B.
Quad B 76 percent, 233 pounds.
Okay. Quad C.
Seventy-six percent, 231 pounds.
Quad D.
Seventy-six percent, 229 pounds.
Okay.
Would you give us the O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> as long as we are plotting?
Roger. Stand by for O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have got those numbers in a percent. We are going to switch them over to pounds, and in the meantime, we are going to be changing our ground antenna in about another 2-1/2 minutes. You can expect a COMM glitch. Over.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. I have your oxygen and hydrogen quantities when you are ready to copy.
Ready.
Oxygen tank number 1 270 pounds, 270; oxygen tank 2 267, 267 pounds. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
Roger. On the hydrogen, hydrogen tank 1 19.7; hydrogen tank 2 20.1. Over.
Understand; 19.7 and 20.1.
Roger. You are a little bit low on the line on your graph due to the fact that they started out low.
Roger.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. How me? Over.
Loud and clear. I was just checking. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Frank. Your 51-hour update of block data will be omitted. The block data you have on board is satisfactory. Over.
Understand. The block data we have aboard is satisfactory.
Right. That's for the flyby and pericynthian plus 2 hour block update. We would like also to get a current up-to-date report on all your windows. We are trying to make some alternate plans for using the center hatch window when you are in lunar orbit, and we would like to make sure we understand exactly what the condition of all five windows is. Over.
Okay. Number - window number 1 and number 5 are clouded, but they may be partially useful. The hatch window is very badly clouded. Windows number 2 and 4 are good.
Okay. Understand the hatch window is unusable, 1 and 5 are partially usable, and the rendezvous windows are both good.
Right.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. We would like to ask you about the next few hours in the flight plan. We are inclined to let Jim go ahead and sleep and to slip the P23 that occurs at 52:15. On the other hand, we would think it would probably be a good idea if he returned more to the normal sleep rest cycle; and if you got him up nominally to do the 52:15 work, then perhaps he would be ready to go back to sleep at about 61 hours, when he nominally is expected to do so.
Okay. He's up now, eating. We are planning to go to normal procedures on the flight plan.
Okay. That - that's fine then. If - you know, there is no - it's not time critical that P23 be done at 52:15, but if you get up to do it then, that's just fine.
Well, we thought we might give it a try.
Roger.
This sleep cycle here is - we're just going to have to real time it, I guess. I'm supposed to be asleep right now but, obviously - or I'm supposed to go to sleep here shortly, but I just got up. We are going to have to play this by ear.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Are the stars in the flight plan proper for this next exercise of P23?
We would like to talk to Jim about it when he is ready to copy.
He's ready.
Okay.
Good morning, Mike. How are you doing?
Fine, fine, Jim. You are sounding good this morning. We would like to give you a little rundown on these stars. As you can see in the flight plan, we've got you scheduled for a number 33, Antares, number 34, Atria, and number 40, old Altair. Now, the first of those, Antares, is in plane; the second two are out of plane. As you know, we would like to get a mixture of the in and the out of plane. Antares, number 33, is close to the sun, and we expect that you are going to have difficulty getting these measurements on number 33. We would like very much for you to try, but if you are unable to do number 33, then we propose that you use number 42, which is Peacock, to the lunar far horizon. We realize Peacock isn't the greatest one available - greatest star in the sky - but it's about the only one available. Over.
Roger. Understand. I'll - we will go to Antares first and try it. You know, we tried it last time, but I got one set before I lost the moon completely in the white haze. I'll give it another try, and if it doesn't work out, we will go to Peacock and give it -
That - that is affirmative, Jim, and if neither Antares nor Peacock work, well then, we just will be happy to go with Atria and with Altair. We would like them to increase the number of sets and do three on Atria, that is, number 34, and two on Altair, number 40; but that is only in the event that you can get neither Antares nor Peacock.
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you copy?
Roger. This is 8. Copied. We'll increase the number 34 to three and the number set of 40 to two if we cannot get 33 or 42.
Yes, that's exactly right.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We're getting low bit rate from you, rather than high, and on this P23 work, for us to get our data, you're going to have to delay the DSKY display about 10 seconds when it comes up with NOUN - NOUN 87. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are past that 87 display now. Did you write down what your trunnion bias was?
Negative.
Houston, we haven't started 23 yet. Our CAL is zero.
Roger. Understand. Thank you.
We are in the process now to - to go to P23 attitude.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Downlink data shows that on star 33, Jim is using the lunar far horizon when he should be using the lunar near horizon. Over.
Okay. Thank you. 220?
Roger. 220.
Let us check it.
Roger.
You want the far horizon now, Houston?
Roger. Far horizon.
We have far horizon in now, Mike, on 220. I will check again, though.
Yes. That is right. We are requesting the lunar near horizon as per the flight plan, the lunar near horizon. We show that you are using the lunar far horizon.
Okay. Roger. I thought that you had copied up 220 to me. I will put it in the near horizon.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Mike, it's getting kind of damp - we're getting a playback, Mike. It is getting kind of damp in here. It might be a good idea to go back into AUTO on the temp in - the glycol temp in for awhile to try and get some of this moisture out of the cabin.
Roger. Stand by, Bill.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
We concur. We would like you to go back to AUTO on the glycol temp inlet valve. Over.
Okay. When was our lowest radiator OUT TEMP during the last couple of hours while we have been in MANUAL?
I will get it for you.
And we are back in AUTO.
Roger. Back in AUTO, and 29 degrees is as low as we've seen.
Okay. We are showing a CABIN TEMP of about 76. It is very comfortable, but we are getting a lot of condensation on the walls now.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
Roger, Mike. While we are waiting for the spacecraft to maneuver to the moon, I might note that as we get closer to the moon, the light from the sun comes right into the scanning telescope, and it is impossible to use. You have to rely on the sextant alone.
Roger, Jim. Understand that light from the sun is coming into the scanning telescope making it impossible to see, and you have to rely on the sextant alone. Can you attach any angle to that?
Well, Mike, I am right now at the substellar point of 33. I don't know where the sun is exactly from there, but that is about the angle. We're - the optics are pointed right at the moon now.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are going to be changing our antenna in a couple of minutes. You can expect a COMM switch-over.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. The LMP is going to take a little snooze here for a while. I am wondering, can you give me a quick - your view of the system status here before I depart, and, also, give me an idea of when the next cryo stir is due?
Roger, Bill. Will do; stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Your systems remain unchanged. They are all looking good. You can go ahead and stir up the cryo starting right now.
Okay. Will do.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Before Jim makes his next mark, could he call up VERB 01 NOUN 91? We missed the last trunnion. Over.
Roger. The last trunnion was 10660.
10660. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Before Bill gets his snooze, we would like him to give us a PRD readout on all three crewmembers. Over.
Roger. CDR is 0.06, CMP is 0.64, and LMP is 0.64.
Roger. Thank you, Bill.
Looks like I'm the only one that is radioactive.
Understand.
Okay. Houston, we got three sets on 33; we are going now to 34 lunar far horizon for one set. Don't you agree?
We agree. Star 34 lunar far horizon for one set.
Houston, the cryos have been stirred, and could you also give me a quick rundown on how the SPS line temps are doing?
Roger, Bill. Understand you stirred the cryos. Last time we checked, the SPS line temps were excellent; they were nice and warm. We will give you another number right now.
And a PU valve.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. On your SPS system, your oxidizer is running 75 degrees, fuel 74 degrees, and PU valve between 78 and 82 depending on where we measured it. Over.
Real good. Everything really is working fine, isn't it?
Yes, it's really humming along, Bill.
Okay. See you later.
Adios.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
I understand you want two sets on number 40, lunar near horizon. Is that right?
That's affirmative. Two sets on number 40, lunar near horizon.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We missed your last trunnion angle, Frank.
21450.
Roger. 21450, and Paul tells me Valerie is over here and wishes Bill a happy nap.
Okay. Thank you. Tell her that he makes us tired sometimes too, will you?
Roger. I will deliver a modified version of the message.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. On star number 40 that you are doing now, the flight plan only calls for one set of marks. You called down two sets, and it's really your choice. Only one is required. We are glad to have the data if you do a second set. Over.
We will only do one then, if you want to. Our flight plan has been updated to include two sets. That is why I called it down.
Roger. One set is - will suffice.
Apollo 8, Houston. We missed the last trunnion.
Very well, I will read it to you; 21455.
21455. Thank you. Just a matter of interest: it is taking your voice about 1.6 seconds to get down to us.
I'm a little hoarse, that's why.
Okay. Houston, do you want us to go back to the PTC attitude now and start the rotisserie again?
That is affirmative, Frank. We will have the PTC attitude for you in just a second here.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Those PTC attitudes remain pitch 224 degrees, yaw 020 degrees. On the next page, page 239 of your flight plan, those PTC numbers should be changed to reflect that.
Pitch 224 and yaw 20.
That's affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
When you have a few minutes, we would like to hear the detailed crew status report from you.
Like what?
Well, like we would like to know, in the last 24 hours, has anybody had any symptoms similar to Frank's. We would also like to know - You know, we told you the other day to take Marezine as you like - we would like to know if anybody had taken any drugs, and then we would like to talk over there about sweet breads and water and such.
Okay. Nobody has taken any other drugs; nobody took any Marezine; nobody is sick. Bill took one of those pills, a sleep Seconal pill, last night. Everybody had breakfast this morning and ate most of a meal - 1 day 3 - meal A day 3. What else do you want?
We would like to tell you to drink plenty of water. We think that your water intake may be down. We copied your dosimeter readings. The only other thing is we just were wondering how in general you feel. We show you to have about 15 hours sleep total - Frank or Bill about 10, and Jim about the same, and we were wondering just how you are feeling in general.
We all feel fine; we are going to fix it now so that we all have one more rest period before the LOI.
Roger. Thank you.
Happiness is bacon squares for breakfast.
If you don't eat them all, bring them back, and we'll polish them off here.
Okay, Houston. Apollo 8 here. I stand corrected, William had one Marezine. He didn't tell me about it; he snuck it.
Roger. Understand Lovell took the Marezine. Understand.
That's Bill Anders, and he took one when he took the - with the Lomotil, when the doctors told him to.
Roger. We copy that. Thank you.
Okay. We are back on the bar-b-que attitude, starting PTC.
Roger, Apollo 8. Thank you.
Mike, we ran the latest state vector we have through the P21, and it showed the pericynthian at 69.7 miles.
Yes, we were all having big talks about that down here. It looks like you are giving us a real good comparison on our system. Looking - looking extremely good.
We've got the navigator par excellence.
I believe.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. What was the time you used on that P21?
6910 there, Mr. Slide Rule.
Thank you.
Mike, I wonder if Buzz wants us to change the time?
No, that is fine.
Oh, okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. Are you going to give us an update for a maneuver PC plus 2 that does not assume a flyby maneuver?
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Roger. Here is a rather brief summary of the updates that you will be getting. The one that you have now for PC plus 2 following an LOI minus 8 flyby maneuver is still good. That will not be updated. The next update you will get will be MCC 4. After that, you will get two PC plus 2 maneuvers, that assume MCC 4 completed. One will be a minimum ΔV|DELTA-V, and the other will be a fast return. Do you copy?
Roger. Understand, and also I take it for MCC 4 you are going to give us a new alignment. Is that correct?
That is affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. I've got a lot of talking to do regarding TV cameras and brackets and whatnot. I would like to start in on it whenever you are ready to talk about it.
Let me get a piece of paper out.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Okay. First a question. Are you planning to show us TV pictures of the earth today?
Well, that is what we wanted to do. It seems that would be the most interesting thing we can show you, but we - you know, we had trouble with the lens.
Well, okay, that's good. All this procedure that I am going to give to you here is relative to what we hope are fixes to the lens and for looking out your rendezvous window at the earth, and all the gimbal angles and all that good stuff is based toward looking out the window at the earth rather than at the moon. Over.
Roger.
Okay. First, unstow the red filter, the polarizing filter, the red and blue filter holder, and some tape. Over.
Okay. Let me write this down.
Roger. I'd suggest that. I've got a whole page full.
Okay.
Alright. Tape the red filter to the telephoto lens. That red filter is the 25A red filter, not the one that is in the red and blue filter holder.
Roger.
Attach telephoto lens to the camera.
Okay. We can figure out how to do that. Roger.
Insure that the automatic light control, the ALC switch on the camera, is in the IN position. Over.
ALC IN. Roger.
Roger. Attach camera to the adjustable TV bracket and attach the bracket to the TV mounting point on the commander's side of the hatch to point out rendezvous window number 2.
Roger.
Okay. There is a note here that says use dovetail on top of camera, rather than the side dovetail. Use the dovetail on the top of the camera for mounting to bracket and place the rocking nut on the bracket down, and down means toward your minus X direction.
Roger.
Okay. They say this step I just got through giving you is somewhat complicated. You might want to get the cameras set up early using the instructions I just gave you. When it's properly - -
We are not reading you.
Roger. I say again, the instructions that I just gave you should end up having the camera looking out the window and about 30 degrees yawed left from your plus X-axis, so I suggest you get the camera set up that way early; and if there are any problems, come back to us; we will talk them over. These mounting instructions are sort of complicated.
Roger.
Okay. The next step: dim the interior lights. Over.
Dim interior lights.
Roger. Next, stop passive thermal control at gimbal angles pitch 224, yaw 020, roll 270. Over.
Pitch 224, yaw 020, roll 270.
Roger. Next, acquire on high-gain antenna, switch to AUTO tracks, narrow beam upon acquisition. Over.
Got it.
Okay. Yaw spacecraft left to get good view of earth and your rendezvous window number 2. You may have to pitch slightly as well, but primarily a left yawing maneuver to get a good view of the earth.
Got it.
Okay. This maneuver is going to put you very close to your scan limits for the high-gain antenna, so while you are making the maneuver, check your lights. If your scan limit light comes on, you still have got 15 degrees to play with. But the only message is, should you break lock, then you are going to have to go back and reacquire and do that maneuver over again, because you are going to be very close to the edge of your high-gain antenna capability.
Thank you.
Okay. And then finally, now that you have got the spacecraft over there, aim the camera as required to include the earth in the field of view, and do not touch the body of the lens while televising. Apparently, if you put your hands on the lens itself, it causes electrical interference. Over.
Okay. Aim camera and do not touch lens while televising.
Right. And in all this stuff in all these pictures using the ALC, it is important that you let the camera stabilize for at least 10 or 20 seconds, to let the ALC do its thing.
Stabilize for 10 to 20 seconds. Thank you.
Right. Now we have some additional instructions in case this does not work. They say a full 20, Frank, on that ALC. It requires a full 20 seconds undisturbed for the ALC to properly do its thing. Now if these procedures that I've given you do not work, then we will be giving you some more, and they have to do with other filters and various combinations thereof. So I'd have the polarizing filter and the red and blue filter holder at hand because we will be attempting to use those in addition to the red filters if this procedure doesn't work.
All very well, Mike.
That's all we have right now. We will have a few more remarks on the TV coming up to you later. I would suggest that you get set up for this early, and if you have any questions on it, shoot them down to us. We have a bunch of experts down here to help out.
Thank you; will do.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Just a voice check, Frank.
Roger. You're loud and clear.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We would like some high bit rate data when you can get it locked up on the high gain. We haven't had any of that for a while.
Roger. We will do that.
Thank you. How is that camera bracket thing working out?
We are doing it right now.
Houston, this is Apollo 8 transmitting to you on the high gain. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear, Frank. Thank you.
Apollo 8 transmitting on the high-gain antenna.
Apollo 8, Houston. You are loud and clear. Thank you for the high gain.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. Are you getting high bit rate all right?
That is affirmative, Apollo 8. We are getting a good high bit rate.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I've got some more talking to do about the TV any time it's convenient for you.
Go ahead.
Okay. First thing, we've made no provisions in these instructions for taking pictures of the moon. If you get some moon shots after it's all over by looking out a different window or by making some small maneuver, of course, we would be happy to have them, but the show as scheduled is just out the window at the earth only. Over.
Roger.
The second point is, of course, when you stop your passive thermal control, you are about 90 degrees to the earth line, so when you make that yaw left, you are going to have to yaw left until your middle gimbal angle is in the vicinity of 60 degrees. You will get the additional 30 degrees by offset between where the camera is pointed and your plus X axis. But the two together are going to total up around 90. We just wanted to make sure that you understood you were going to be working with a large middle gimbal angle. Over.
Roger. We understand that. We also are looking at the earth right now, and there is a spectacular long thin band of clouds. Looks like it may be a jet stream. It's absolutely spectacular - going almost all the way - or half way around the earth.
Roger. Well, you might want to repeat that during the TV narrative, and we would like you, if possible, to go into as much of a detailed description as you poets can on the various colors and sizes of those things and how the earth appears to you, in as much detail as you can possibly muster. Over.
Roger. I figure we will have to do that because I bet you - I won't bet - but I bet the TV doesn't work.
Well, we won't take that bet, but anyway, we are standing by for a nice lurid description, and we would suggest that you talk a little bit slower than you did yesterday. Over.
Okay.
And the only other thing on this TV is that the experts tell us that - do not point - with the wide angle lens on the camera, do not point at either the earth or the moon. It comes close to damaging interior of the instrument due to the fact that it's too bright. Over.
Understand.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're going to have to switch to an OMNI.
Roger, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Just checking the voice COMM, Frank.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We'll be switching antennas from Madrid to Goldstone in another 3 minutes. You can expect a glitch on your COMM.
Thank you.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're reading you loud and clear through Goldstone. Over.
Okay. We have the television ON now, and we're trying to maneuver to the - to the earth.
Roger. Understand.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. We're maneuvering to position now for the TV. Bill's got it set up in Frank's left rendezvous window, and I'm over in Bill's spot looking out the right rendezvous window, and the earth is now passing through my window. It's about as big as the end of my thumb.
About as big as the end of your thumb at arm's length, huh?
That's right. I think what we see now is South America down below us.
Roger. Is the TV camera pointed about 30 degrees yaw left from the plus X axis?
Stand by a moment. We're checking it. We think we've got it in the right position. We're going into position now.
Okay.
Houston, are you getting any sort of a picture?
Apollo 8, Houston. Negative; not yet.
Okay. Houston, Apollo 8. We should have - -
Hello, Houston; this is Apollo 8. We have the television camera pointed directly at the earth now and have followed the instructions you gave us.
Roger, Frank. We're picking something up on our TV. It's not very good so far, but let it sit for a second, and we'll have more instructions for you.
Okay. It's coming into view now, Frank.
It is?
Yes. We have it in the corner of our screen. You're slightly off on your pointing, but we're getting a darn good look at the corner of it.
It's moving off, Frank. It's moving off our - 3 o'clock on our TV screen. I have no idea what to tell you about which way to point.
It's moving further away. We've lost it now.
Apollo 8, Houston. Receiving nothing now. Over.
Okay.
We're receiving the picture; we're just not seeing the view of the earth.
Roger. I got you.
Okay. We are just picking it up at 3 o'clock on our screen.
Okay.
It is moving up toward 1 o'clock and in toward the center; keep it going in that direction.
Okay.
It's looking better. You're holding it about 1 or 2 o'clock. Looking better. Give us a little more in that same direction. You're down at 3 o'clock now. We see about half of what you see. Too much. It is disappearing at our 5 o'clock. Now it is coming back. It is half off - screen at our 2 o'clock.
And it's disappeared off at our 3 o'clock. There, It is coming back in now. It is headed toward the center of our screen.
MARK.
It is right in the center of our screen. Just hold her - hold her steady. It is really looking good. Okay. We have - -
What you're seeing, Mike, is a - Houston, what you are seeing is the Western Hemisphere. Looking - at the top is the North Pole; in the center - just lower to the center is South America - all the way down to Cape Horn. I can see Baja California and the southwestern part of the United States. There is a big long cloud bank going northeast, covers a lot of the Gulf of Mexico, going up to the eastern part of the United States, and it appears now that the east coast is cloudy, I can see clouds over parts of Mexico; the parts of Central America are clear. And we can also see the white, bright spots of the subsolar point on the light side of the earth.
Roger. Could you give me some ideas about the colors, and also, could you try a slight maneuver? It is disappearing. We're seeing about half of it. It is going off to our 12 o'clock. Now it is going off to our 3 o'clock. That is the wrong direction. Yes, that is a good direction.
We need another small correction to bring it to our center screen. If you could maneuver toward the terminator, that is the part of it we are missing. We are getting the lighted portion. There you go; that's fine. Stop it right there.
Okay. For colors, waters are all sort of a royal blue; clouds, of course, are bright white; the reflection off the earth is - appears much greater than the moon. The land areas are generally a brownish - sort of dark brownish to light brown in texture. Many of the vortices of clouds can be seen of the various weather cells. A long band of - it appears cirrus clouds that extend from the entrance to the Gulf of Mexico going straight out across the Atlantic. The terminator, of course, cuts through the Atlantic Ocean right now, going from north to south. Southern Hemisphere is almost completely clouded over, and up near the North Pole there is quite a few clouds. Southwestern Texas and southwestern United States is clear. I'd say there are some clouds up in the northwest and over in the northeast portion.
Roger. Could you maneuver toward the terminator again, please?
A little bit more. Stop her right there and hold it. It keeps slipping up a little bit; could you maneuver slightly more toward the terminator?
How is that, Houston?
We are getting about half of the earth, Frank. The top half - our top half which includes the dark portion it - is obscured.
How is the definition on the picture?
Looks pretty good.
Can you see cloud patterns at all?
That's affirmative.
Good.
Are you still seeing it, Houston?
Yes, we are seeing it. We are missing the portion of the earth that is over toward the terminator. The dark portion of the earth is what we are not picking up. We are getting about three-quarters or four-fifths of the rest of it.
Roger. I will move it, and tell me when I am getting better or worse please.
Good.
Stop right there. That is worse, Bill. Go back where you were. You made it disappear to our 3 o'clock. Now it's coming back. Okay. Stop right there. Now you are back where you were, and we need a motion that is about 90 degrees to that last one you gave us.
That is the wrong 90 degrees. 180 degrees away from that one.
Stop right there. Okay. Now we have lost a different half of it. I need a motion 90 degrees to that last one.
That is good right there, Bill. That is good right there.
Apollo 8, Houston. If you can stick your polarizing filter in front of the camera without disturbing anything else, it might improve the quality slightly.
Standby.
Roger, Bill.
Okay. The polarising filter is in front.
How is it now, Mike?
Still looking good. That didn't make much of a change one way or another, but in general, considering how far away you are, it's looking excellent.
Well, I hope that everyone enjoys the picture that we are taking of themselves. How far away from earth now, Jim, about?
We have you about 180 000.
You are looking at yourselves at 180 000 miles out in space.
Frank, what I keep imagining is if I am some lonely traveler from another planet what I would think about the earth at this altitude, whether I think it would be inhabited or not.
Don't see anybody waving; is that what you are saying?
I was just kind of curious if I would land on the blue or the brown part of the earth.
You better hope that we land on the blue part.
So do we, babe.
Jim is always for land landings.
Roger. This picture is drifting off center again. If you could make another correction to bring it back. I couldn't tell you which direction, but you're going the right way, you're going the right way. A little bit more; a little bit more. Whoa, stop right there. That's the best centering we have had, Apollo 8. If you could just hold that, that's perfect,
To give you some idea, Mike, of what we can see: I can pick out the southwest coastline of the Gulf and where Houston should be, and also the mouth of the Mississippi; I can see Baja California and that particular area. I am using a monocular that we have aboard.
Roger. Understand.
This is an 8-power instrument I have.
Right. Well, we are seeing the entire earth now including the terminator. Course we can't see anything past the terminator at all. Are you able with your binoculars to see the dark horizon? Anything past the terminator?
Negative, Mike. We can't see anything past the terminator with the binoculars or without them. This earth is just too bright, and it cuts down the night adaptation to see anything on the dark side.
Roger. Understand.
Since this is winter - since this is winter time in the northern hemisphere, we can see all of the South Pole and the southern ice cap, and not too much of the North Pole.
Hey, you and Jim better get together. Jim just said he saw the North Pole.
He is looking out a different window.
That is what makes it different.
Do you still have the - -
He has the monocular upside down.
Do you still have the polarizing filter in front of the camera?
Negative?
Okay.
Try putting it back in front of the camera one more time.
Okay.
And once again, we need a small attitude correction. Our earth is disappearing up and to the right. Our earth and your earth. The wrong way, wrong way. A little bit more. Okay. That is fine if you can hold it right there. Oops! Now it's slipping back off again. Okay. Keep coming a little bit more, a little bit more. Okay. Ninety degrees to that direction; that is the wrong 90, the other way. There we go. A little bit more. Nope, wrong way, wrong way; I am sorry. Keep coming in that direction. No, it is gone up at our 12 o'clock. There we go, it is coming back down. There we go, it's coming back down, it's coming back down. Bring it down a little bit more. Okay. Stop. Now we need 90 degrees to that direction again.
I hope that the next camera has a sight on it.
Roger.
How is that?
Well, that has disappeared, just practically. We were wondering if there was any chance of your looking out one of the other windows and seeing the moon? Hey, it is coming back in, Bill. Okay. Hold it right there. That is just fine for the earth right where you are. That is extremely good on the earth if you can just hold that.
I don't think we have - It has the polarizing filter in front of it now, Mike.
Roger. Thank you, and it is centered very well. We get a very slight improvement with this, but in general, it is very good considering the distance. How about the moon, Frank? Is it visible through one of your other windows? Could you get it visible with a small maneuver?
Negative. I think we will have to save the moon for another time.
Roger. I understand. You are still very well centered with your picture. We noticed a couple of jumps in the apparent intensity. Did you make some filter changes?
Roger. We tried to put that other red filter in front of it, but it didn't seem to fit.
Roger.
We would - On a final test when you get down to the end of your allotted time here, we would like you to remove all filters and let us see how it looks with all filters removed, and then we would like to get several spotmeter readings at the very end after the test.
Okay. We will be removing the red filter now.
Roger.
Do you still have us, Mike? The lens is off now.
Roger. We have it, and if you could maneuver it toward the terminator slightly, you would again center our picture.
Okay. Stand by. How's that? Is that the right direction?
That is the right direction. Keep coming. Now that is the wrong direction, Frank. Did you - -
How is it now, Houston?
Well, negative. I need another maneuver toward the terminator. It is drifting off the screen to our 11 o'clock. We appear to need a maneuver toward the terminator, Frank.
Thank you.
No, that is apparently the wrong way, Frank. We are starting to lose the picture. There you go. That is the correct way.
Okay, Houston. How's that for today?
That is just fine, Frank. That's great. We would like to, at the conclusion here, take three spotmeter readings. You can do that at any time at your convenience. We would just like to get some after-the-fact readings on the earth intensity.
Roger. Jim has got the spotmeter on now.
Thank you.
Is it centered now, Houston?
Not quite, Frank.
That's good right there. Hold that right there. That's good. That's perfect.
Okay, earth. This is Apollo 8 signing off for today.
Good show, Apollo 8. We appreciate it. See you manana.
Roger.
We have Haney down here following your trajectory, so all is well. He says you're 10 minutes from the moon's sphere of influence.
Okay. Good.
Houston, Apollo 8. Returning to the PTC mode.
Apollo 8, Houston. Understand; returning to PTC. Thank you.
Roger.
You can tell Jim he is getting pretty ham-handed with that P21; he got a perilune altitude three-tenths of a mile off what we are predicting down here.
Is that right?
Roger. Apparently, he got 69.7 and the RTC says 70.
Are we going to leave it at that, or are we going to correct it to make it lower?
We are talking about it, Frank.
We have got a lumen reading of about between 1 and 1.25 thousand - 1.25 K.
Roger. Understand; between 1 and 1.25 K. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. If you put your CM TLM to ACCEPT, we will send you our state vector.
Touché.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
How does everything look, Mike, all our systems and everything? See any switches out of place?
Negative. I'll take a check around here, but it is looking good. Just a second.
We are all over the cabin, Mike, like monkeys, and I wanted to make sure we didn't hit anything.
Apollo 8, Houston. Everything is looking good down here. All switches and systems are GO.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. How are you reading on OMNI D?
We are reading you loud and clear, Frank.
Okay. We are reading you like that, also. Thank you.
We are having a playback of your TV shows and are all enjoying it down here. It was better than yesterday because it didn't preempt the football game.
Thank you. Don't tell me they cut off a football game; didn't they learn from Heidi?
Well, you and Heidi are running neck and neck in the telephone call department.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Hey, Jerry, how much water does this - the water dispenser in the lower equipment bay, the one that puts out hot and cold water - how much comes out of that with each shot?
Stand by. I'll take a check on that. And, by the way, welcome to the moon's sphere.
The moon's fair?
The moon's sphere - you're in the influence.
That's better than being under the influence.
Hey, Jerry?
Go ahead, 8.
My handy LMP had his schematics out at the drop of a hat and informs me that it's 1 ounce per cycle.
Apollo 8, looks like the flying EECOM the ground EECOM came to a dead heat on that one.
They did?
Roger. We got the same answer at the same time.
I'll have Bill put it on the tape recorder and send it down to you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay, 8. We want to run a little exercise on the ground here to make are that we're able to dump the tape and bring the voice portion back to Houston in a timely manner. So we plan to dump your tape, and we're going to exercise the procedure on the ground to get it back here and take a listen to it. We believe that we have something on the tape already unless you have recorded over it after the last dump. Just to make sure, we'd like to have you just say a few words, give us a short count or something on the tape and anything else that you might want to put on there. And we're going to do this in the next 5 minutes before we get away from Madrid. That's the site we want to exercise, so we'll go ahead and do that, and we'll tell you before we make the dump.
Roger.
Houston, Houston, this is Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Okay. Ken, we put a few comments on the last of the tape after we heard from you, and it's being rewound now, and you can have it as soon as we get it back to the beginning.
Okay. We'll have to wait. It looks like you are going out of the attitude to use high gain. We'll catch it next time around and then dump it.
Okay. I know this would be better in high bit rate, so it will probably take quite awhile.
Alright.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Do you think you're in a position where you could use the high gain?
I'll give it a try.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're dumping at this time.
Roger. Tape voice is probable.
We ought to also get a check on it at low bit rate for DSE voice, Ken.
Apollo 8, are you saying that everything that's on there now is in high bit?
That's where my switch was.
Okay. We'll take a look at it then. If there wasn't anything that was previously recorded in low bit, then we'll come back and maybe take a look at that, too.
Okay. We might get ... if maybe we can get in a little closer to the moon to put as big a strain on it as we can.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We've completed the dump, and the tape recorder's back to you. You can use it any way you want. We may want to dump that thing again, and if we do we'll go ahead and use the same information unless you have something else that you specifically wanted to put on there later. Listening to the voice quality - it sounds real good. We're coming up on a midcourse 4 and right now it's - talking about doing it on time, and you can anticipate the burn in the neighborhood of 3 foot per second. We're considering and would like for you to think about the possibility of doing this burn using the onboard vector and just have us update the vector in the LM slot, so that you will have the MSFN vector on board. But it looks like it won't have any big effect on the burn results, and it might prove interesting. So if you think about that one for a bit and let us know if you have any suggestions or thoughts on the subject.
Roger. You say it uses the onboard vectors and leaves the MSFN vectors on the LM slot.
That's affirmed, if that's what you would like to do, right. We considered it, and it looks like that would be a reasonable thing.
Roger. Frank and Jim are asleep now, and I'll bring this up to them when they wake up.
Okay. Real fine.
Apollo 8, Houston. How about stirring up the oxygen?
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Bill. I guess I want to belay my last about using the onboard state vector for MCC 4. After looking at it some more on the ground, they've got to get going on making the PAD's and doing all their computations, and rather than put it off or do it twice, we're going to go ahead and go with the procedures we've been using all along. On the lunar orbit stuff, we've been looking it over and we got several guys - Jack Schmitt and company in the back room - looking at what effect your windows have. And, basically, it looks like there's two options that will make an impact on that REV 2. One of the options, of course, will be just to have you and Jim change seats and let Jim look out and get his SAM that way, and another option will be to roll the bird over and let Jim point the optics as far forward as he can get them and take his SAM through the telescope. And I guess we'd like to have any thoughts that you folks have on what you think you can do with the windows; if you have anything, we'd like to factor it into our thinking and go ahead and firm up our plans as early as we can. We'd like not to put it off so that we have none of these things to do after midcourse. You folks can probably tell us more about what you can do with those windows. So if you have any thoughts, go ahead and sing out with them, and we'll see what we can do about factoring that in.
Okay. With reference to the midcourse, I think that's generally agreed upon, that we do it like we've always been doing it. Now, with respect to the windows, center windows, essentially, are unusable. The two side windows are - may be all right for observation, and the problem with the rendezvous windows is that they're pretty small. And I just thought we'd have to play the window game by ear almost. Not really sure what capability we're going to have. And we'll give you some more thoughts on this later.
Okay. How about exercising the idea of rolling over and having Jim do his polarization through the telescope because if we have to change attitudes we'd like to go ahead and start thinking about what effects that'll have on such things as antenna orientation and all that.
Okay. We'll - I'll mention it to them when they wake up.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Apollo 8, we'd like to update your CMC clock. This is not to correct errors which we have now but just to make up for some effects that we're going to have in lunar orbit. And what we'd like to have you do is go to P00 and ACCEPT and let us update the clock time.
Stand by.
Okay. You got P00 and ACCEPT.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We're completed with the clock update, and the computer is yours.
Roger. Going to BLOCK.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
How about an O<sub>2</sub> purge?
Okay.
Thank you.
There's number 1.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Houston. Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like to update CMC. The order that we'll update will be the LM state vector, the CSM state vector, and then the external ΔV|DELTA-V and the REFSMMAT. So any time you're free with it, we can have P00 in ACCEPT; we'll go ahead with it.
I understand you're going to update LM state vector, CSM state vector, and external ΔV|DELTA-V and the REFSMMAT.
Affirmative. And I'll have one, two, three PAD's to read to you.
Standby. Okay. You've got P00 in ACCEPT.
Okay, thank you. And just a minute, I'll be with you on the PAD's. They'll be three maneuver PAD's, one of them MCC 4.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We're ready to copy if you read.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. I thought maybe we had lost COMM here for a second.
No, I'm just behind.
Okay. Apollo 8, let me just read you midcourse correction number 4.
Okay.
Alright. Midcourse correction number 4: the RCS/G&N 62888 November Alfa November Alfa 060:59:54.30 minus 00012, minus 00011, plus 00012 031 008 323 November Alfa, plus 00618 00020 011 00020 17 2965 308 Alpha-Centauri, up 073, left 34. For the stars, it will be the primary Sirius, secondary Rigel, 129 155 010. Over.
Roger. MCC 4, RCS/G&N 62888 NA, NA 060:59:54.30, minus 00012, minus 00011, plus 00012 031 008 323, NA. Are you with me so far?
Keep going.
Plus 00618 00020 011 00020 17 2965 308 Alpha-Centauri, up 073, left 34, primary Sirius, secondary Rigel 129 155 010. Over.
That's correct, Apollo 8.
And what else have you got?
Okay. I've got one for pericynthian plus 2, and it's a minimum ΔV|DELTA-V solution.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Okay. That's pericynthian plus 2. RCS/G&N 62871 November Alfa, and stand by one. Okay. We'll pick up with a pitch trim and yaw trim of not applicable; time 071:07:22.16, minus 00468, plus 00254, plus 00181 173 101 027 November Alfa plus 00187 00563 515 00563 01 3169 198 044, down 044, left 45, plus 1100, minus 02500 12967 36198 137:01:53, primary Sirius, secondary Rigel 129:155:010, four jets plus X. This assumes execution of midcourse correction number 4 and uses the same alignment as midcourse correction 4. over.
Roger. Pericynthian plus 2, minimum ΔV|DELTA-V RCS/G&N 62871, NA, NA. 071:07:22.16, minus 00468, plus 00254, plus 00181 173 101 027, NA, plus 00187 00563 515 00563 01 3169 198 044, down 044, left 45, plus 1100, minus 02500 12967 36198 137:01:53, primary Sirius, secondary Rigel, 1.29 155 010, four jets plus X, assumes MCC 4 with same alignment. Over.
That is correct, Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8. Confirm that boresight star and SPA are exactly the same number and not typographical error.
Roger, Apollo 8. They are checking that. Apollo 8, the computer is yours. You can take it back.
Roger. Going to BLOCK.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. Do you copy?
I do now loud and clear. I've got one more PAD for you, and the confirmation that those boresight star number and the pitch angle are correct at 44.
Roger. And we are ready to do our P52 preferred alignment at this time. Are you ready?
Affirmative.
Okay. We are ready to copy.
Okay. This is a pericynthian plus 2 for a fast return. This will be SPS/G&N 62871, minus 161, plus 129 071:06:42.07, plus 45224, minus 06216, minus 18712 001 287 351, November Alfa plus 00187 49336 603 49118 112 038 296, earth up 010, right 37, plus 1475, plus 06500 13239 36913 106:09:23; primary star Sirius, secondary Rigel 129 155 010, no ullage, assumes execution of midcourse correction 4 and uses the same alignment. The time for MCC 5 for GERU determination - that's Golf Echo Romeo Uniform - this will be a GET of 83:02; use P37 NC-4, steps 1 through 10 and NC-8 steps 3 and 4. I say again, use P37 November Charlie 4 steps 1 through 10 and November Charlie steps 3 and 4; velocity 400K for corridor control chart 36507. Over.
Houston, Roger. This is Apollo 8. You copy?
This is Houston. No joy.
Roger, Houston. This is Apollo. How you read?
Okay. Loud and clear, Bill.
Okay, Ken. Pericynthian plus 2, fast return SPS/G&N 62871, minus 161, plus 129 071:06:42.07, plus 45224, minus 06216, minus 18712 001 28 603 49118 112 038 296 earth up 010, right 37, plus 1475, plus 06400 1323 936 913 106:09:23, primary Sirius, secondary Rigel 129 155 010, no ullage, assume MCC 4 same alignment, MCC 5 GERU determination GET 83:02 P37 NC-4 0 through 10 and copy NC-8, 3, and 4. Velocity at 400K 36507. Over.
Okay, Apollo 8. That's correct with one exception: in the PAD format under longitude NOUN 61, that is plus 06500. Over.
Roger. That's what I have, plus 06500.
Okay. That's correct, Apollo 8.
And we're ready to copy whatever else you have.
Apollo 8, let's go back and confirm on your minimum ΔV|DELTA-V pericynthian plus 2 that the pitch column is 101; that's the fifth block down.
Roger. Pitch. Roger, pitch 101.
Okay. Thank you very much. And the item we have left to go is that we'd like to get with you on how you want to handle the problem with windows on REV 2.
Okay, Houston. Stand by on that, please.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We want you to come up with a suggested redline for RCS usage during lunar orbit, also, please.
Roger. That's in work.
And for your information, Houston, when the sun is shining on window 5, it's pretty hazy; window number 1 is a little bit better.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, go ahead.
Roger. We tried to get this realignment. We need - Do you have a maneuver to get us some gimbal angles so we don't get gimbal lock when we get the preferred alignment?
Stand by on that.
Thank you.
Houston, on our present position, we'll go into gimbal lock. I figure to try and get the preferred angle.
Say again, Apollo 8.
In running through PROGRAM 52, we got a PROGRAM ALARM 401 which would indicate that if we continued, we'd drive it into gimbal lock.
Roger. I understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. This should be an OPTION 1 like OPTION 3.
Houston, we're doing an OPTION 1 like OPTION 3. We keep getting a 401 ALARM, which says desired RCTU yields gimbal lock.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. It appears that you have maneuvered around the gimbal locks system.
Roger. Roger.
Okay. Sorry we were late on that answer.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Well, we stopped and went through coarse align of P52 and then we got fine align, and pick-a-pair, pick Capella, but she drove and didn't get to any place. I didn't pick Capella, and I can't recognize any out there right now. Can I re-cycle here and go back and pick a pair?
That's affirmative, Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
My plan is to go back into re-enter PROGRAM 52 - well, it did not drive to Capella, and I can't recognize it in the scanning telescope. My plan is to go back into recall P52.
Okay. Stand by one.
Apollo 8, can you confirm that you zeroed the optics prior to starting?
Roger. That's affirmative. We zeroed the optics.
Apollo 8, Houston. You have a GO for a second try in P52 with an OPTION 3.
Okay. I now have Aldebaran in the scanning telescope; I might want to call that one instead of Capella.
Okay.
I'll see what it comes up with first, though.
Houston, Apollo 8. We came up with an unacceptable difference in our stars; we're going to have to recycle.
Roger.
If we don't get this midcourse in, what will that do to our pericynthian?
Stand by. We'll -
Apollo 8, Houston. In the event that we don't get this midcourse in, we'll still go for an LOI, and it's been suggested you might try Mirfak which is OCTO 10.
That's the one we're trying now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
We are all set up and counting down at 8 minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 8, our data is down right now; appreciate making sure you have the tape recorder on.
Roger. I am going to go - I'll have to go COMMAND RESET. You've got control.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. You have some pitch and yaw angles for our PTC extra burn.
Okay, Apollo 8. That's pitch 348, yaw 315.
Pitch 348, yaw 315.
That's affirmative. And would you give us another hack on your countdown time?
It's 5:18 17 16 15 14.
Thank you.
Houston, I will give you a mark in 4 minutes.
Alright. Thank you.
3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Four minutes.
Apollo 8, Houston. How about switching the BIOMED switch over to the left.
Roger. 3, 2, 1 -
MARK.
Switched.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. Burn on time, angles nominal, burn time about 12 seconds, 0.2 feet per second after the ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub>, 0 in VG<sub>X</sub>. We have transferred the results of the burn over to the left slot VERB 66.
Roger. And got a couple of items that I would like to clean up. We will get you an RCS budget. We've got one redline now; we are trying to get some firmer numbers for you, and we will have those in a little bit. Right now your PTC usage is right on the flight plan line, so everything looks pretty good there. We want to get a crew status report from you. We would like to firm up the REV 2 flight plan idea; and sometime at your convenience, we would like to take a reading of the PRD for the commander and CMP and then have you swap them. We are trying to isolate the - what the possible reason is for the discrepancies or the disparity in the two readings.
Roger.
And we are maneuvering to the PTC attitude, Houston.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Could you give us the sign of that Z residual?
Stand by, Houston. Alright, Houston. Looks like we didn't record just the Z. We recorded ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub>, which is minus 0.2.
Okay. Understand.
ΔV|DELTA-V was 0.1, but we didn't get the sign.
Roger. Understand that was ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 0.2. I copied ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>Z</sub>; ZULU is 0.2. Is that incorrect?
Roger. It was 0.1, but we didn't get the sign.
Okay. Thank you.
We can get it. We have it on the tape, Houston, whenever you want to dump it.
Roger. Thank you.
It'll be about the last 5 minutes worth.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, for the PRD's: CDR is 0.07, CMP is 0.64, LMP is 0.80. Note that the CMP's hasn't changed since we started and the commander's hasn't changed much. We have swapped PRD's; commander has LMP, CMP has commander's, and LMP has CMP's PRD. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. Crew status report as follows: water, the commander has about 50 clicks so far today; CMP 43; and the LMP is 44. We've eaten two meals so far today. Day 3 meal A and B; consumed most of it except for the hard hard bite, which no one cares for. Pudding was outstanding. We're at a gain of pericynthian now of plus 63 miles. Commander and CMP have had a rest period just before the midcourse 4 of about 2 hours.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
We're at a gain of about 20 500 miles from the moon at 61:14. How does that agree with what you figure?
Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like you're on the secondary loop. We would like to run that for about 5 minutes.
Roger. We're doing the ECS redundant component check.
Roger. We'll follow.
Getting any data now Houston? Guess you are. Okay. See you stopped my tape then. I've been running for about 3 extra minutes here to record the check.
Roger. We have data now. That was a temporary loss.
What's the matter? Was it chow time down there?
Roger. Didn't know you could smell it that far away.
Give me a call when you're satisfied with the secondary loop; it's stabilized out here pretty well.
Wilco, and you might tell Jim that our RTCC is about 4 miles off; we had 20 496.
Fine.
We just put compressor 2 on ac 2.
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you show battery B as voltage dropped some from the postcharge value? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Confirm that battery B is a little bit lower, and this is attributed to the parasitic loads that are on there.
Okay. I just didn't see the same kind of drop for A. So if you think it's okay, it's fine.
That's affirm. You don't have the same parasitic loads on that; B is actually drawing some.
Okay. I guess that's the radiators, huh?
Apollo 8, Houston. We've seen enough of the secondary evaporator. We would like for you to wait about 2 minutes between the time you go to RESET and the time you turn the pump off.
I agree; good idea. And we plan to leave the water control in AUTO.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. Looking over the - our redundant component check, it appears we have not yet checked the integrity of the secondary loop radiators; and if you haven't done that, sometime we would like to open up the secondary radiators but not flow through them and just measure the accumulator pressure.
Stand by.
Houston, we don't show that in our pre-LOI check, but we're willing to go ahead and do it if you want to.
Roger. We just noticed that it isn't there, and, yes, we would like to. You understand that we are not proposing that you flow, but merely we check for any pressure decay.
Roger. Wait till I get my trusty assistant here to help me.
Okay, Houston. We're going to blow the secondary, I mean, open the secondary RAD for 30 seconds now.
Roger.
Looks pretty good.
Sure does.
Okay. They're closed now.
Okay. Thank you. Looks good.
Roger. No meteoroids yet.
Apollo 8, Houston. You take your tape recorder to stop, and we'll reset it then and give it back to you.
Roger. It's stopped.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We still need to talk about the REV 2 attitudes we're going to use here to work around the fact that you have a fogged center window. Whenever that's convenient, we'd like to go over what your thoughts are on the subject so we can make sure we can get our flight plan squared away.
My thoughts are to make - to do with the best with what we have. We are not interested in changing a lot of things right now.
Okay. The one proposal that sounds like it has some advantage to it: if we let Jim do his evaluation through the telescope, you do everything exactly the same except you turn and roll over 180 degrees so that your head's up, and let Jim do his tracking through the telescope and you'll still be a yaw right when you go to pick up your TV and that type of thing. It looks like that probably will cover everything. We can do that or we can just go as is and just have to let some of that tracking evaluation go by. Another alternate would be to have Jim look out the right-hand rendezvous window, and you may have to change your attitude in order to get the same picture there also.
I think we'll try to do that, but I don't - this is one of the things that we'll work out when we get there.
Okay. The reason we were looking into it in the flight plan is, if you do want to try rolling over and flying heads up or something of that nature, we can help Bill get a little more out of his photography by giving him some new film settings and that type of thing. We'll have something like that available; in case you do fly heads up, why, we'll have some numbers, we can call up for film settings.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. We are going to have to dump more urine here shortly. Will this bother your tracking?
Apollo 8, we're checking on that with the tracking people now.
Houston, just give us the time when we can start on it, and we'll hold off until you say so.
Okay, and you can anticipate a handover between stations here on the hour, and you might get a slight glitch as we go through. I'll give you a call when we get back.
Thank you, Ken. What station are we going to be going to, Ken?
Okay. We'll be going to Honeysuckle.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're cleared for a dump at this time, and I understand this is the last gas station for a long time.
You mean you don't want us to dump after this for a while?
That's affirm. Due to the tracking as you approach the LOI, they would like to minimize any of these type of perturbations.
Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Roger. Houston through Honeysuckle. We read you loud and clear.
Okay. Good morning.
Good morning.
Thought you went to sleep.
You got over to Australia pretty fast.
Roger. Did that gas station call wake you up?
Man, I've been all eyeballs and elbows here for the last several hours.
I'll bet. If you've got nothing else to do, I do have two charts in your LOI table that I need to give you some update numbers on.
Standby.
We'll get our LOI tables man on the line here, Houston. Stand by.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, CMP here. I understand you have some updates for me.
Yes, sir; I've got a couple of charts in your chart book under LOI, and I have some numbers to fill in, one of them being the chart of LOI ΔV|DELTA-V magnitude versus abort ΔV|DELTA-V.
Okay. Stand by, and I'll get it out.
Roger.
Okay, I have the chart out. Go ahead.
Alright. Mode 1, 5 hours, roll 1.38, pitch 7.89, yaw 357.37. Mode 1, 15 minutes, roll 180.73, pitch 29.46, yaw 1.65. Over.
Roger. The new attitudes for the Mode 1, 5 hour Mode 15 minute are as follows: roll - for the Mode 1, 5 hour, roll 1.38, pitch 7.89, yaw 357.37; Mode 1, 15 minute, roll 180.73, pitch 29.46, yaw 1.65.
Okay. That is correct. Now I also have to give you a couple of points to plot on that curve. The present curve you have drawn is based on a 60-mile perigee or perilune, and you right now have a 62-mile pericynthian; and the reason that your target is for 62 miles is to pass over the landing site, so I have five sets of coordinates for you to copy.
Is this to go on the same chart to redraw the curve?
That is affirmative.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. We'll go in on the LOI ΔV|DELTA-V magnitude 1600, abort ΔV|DELTA-V 2450, two-four-five-zero.
Okay. LOI ΔV|DELTA-V magnitude 1600, abort ΔV|DELTA-V 2450. Stand by just one. I have it; continue.
Okay. The next one is the LOI ΔV|DELTA-V 2000, abort ΔV|DELTA-V 3130.
Roger. I've got that plotted.
2400 LOI ΔV|DELTA-V, abort ΔV|DELTA-V 3880, three-eight-eight-zero.
I've got it plotted.
2800 LOI, abort ΔV|DELTA-V 4700. Over.
Roger. I have that one plotted, too.
Alright. The last one is LOI ΔV|DELTA-V 2990, abort ΔV|DELTA-V 5114. That is almost directly into the end of the present curve, 5114.
Say again the LOI ΔV|DELTA-V magnitude, please.
Okay. LOI ΔV|DELTA-V 2990.
Roger. 2990. Okay. I have it plotted.
Alright. And on the next one, you should have a chart (number 10), and we have three numbers to go in there for a Mode 3 gimbal angle.
Roger. Go ahead with the Mode 3 gimbal angles.
Roll 180.87, pitch 42.31, yaw 1.65.
Mode 3 gimbal angles are as follows: roll 180.87, pitch 42.31, yaw 1.65.
Roger. That is correct.
Could you please send up a French curve for me?
Roger.
Send up a couple.
The only one I have is about 6 foot.
Houston, could you give us some gimbal angles to point at the moon? I never have seen it the whole trip, and I'm wondering which way it is from us now.
Roger. 180.
Houston, Apollo 8. Radio check.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger.
We are getting ready to give you a rundown on your systems. We're going over all the final steps, and we will tell you what we see in the way of trajectory and systems information. And once again, Dr. Joe Kerwin has brought over all the latest news, and we can read that up to you a little bit at a time if you aren't going to sleep.
What's he going to do, read out of the AMA Journal?
Roger.
Go ahead. We are all ears.
Okay. Here is one: the previously scheduled 72-hour cease fire by the Viet Cong went into effect today, 17 hours before the 24 hour allied truce was to begin.
You lost us on the numbers there. What was that again?
The gist of it was that the VC went into a cease fire earlier than the truce that we had planned on, as a Christmas holiday type.
Roger. Good.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Loud and clear. Sorry to have stopped on you there. We are going over the summary of the systems data.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. I have a rundown on your systems here, GNC status. Everything looks real --
Just a minute.
Go ahead.
I want to wait until the LMP gets on the head set, Houston.
Roger.
Okay, Houston, go ahead. Flying EECOM's on the line.
Okay. We'll just start with EECOM business then, I'll give you a summary of your batteries; battery A, we calculate 38.3 amp-hours, battery B --
Stand by a second, Ken.
Let me get my chart out.
Roger.
Go ahead now.
Okay. Battery A 38.3, battery B 36.9, battery C, 38.5. That's looking pretty good. It looks like we got all the things back in that we took out, and we're running right along prediction. We would like to get a battery C voltage from you if you can just reach over there and switch it.
Roger. Thirty-seven volts, on battery C.
Roger. Thirty-seven volts, Okay. The predicted cryo quantities at SEP: on oxygen tank 1, 170; oxygen tank 2, 170; hydrogen 1, 9.5; and hydrogen 2, 10.0. You essentially have single cryo tank capabilities all the way at full power now.
Fine.
The secondary coolant loop really looked good. Looks like you had a nice tight radiator and everything else on there was working right along the performance curves. Your main oxygen regulators both filled at 104 psi during our check. Looking at the lunar orbit, expect to be doing a water boil of about 1 pound per hour, and this is just an approximation; there's quite a variety of estimates as to what the water boiling requirements may be, might go anywhere from boiling lots to not boiling at all. The next water dump will be coming up after TEI, so you don't have to worry about any of that until you get through. Communications predictions are looking good, possibly a little bit better than what we had hoped for, and looks like we're going to get high bit rate on OMNI's with our 210-foot dish at Goldstone. This will be working for us on the first couple of rev's, and then we'll be switching sites, so we'll go back to using OMNI's for high bit. The voice quality on DSE is good. Your fuel cells have been running above nominal for the entire flight, and they really look nice and stable. There's been some destratification -
... on normal voice, doesn't it?
Okay. Looks like may not be able to hack the normal voice. On the cryo tanks, we've had quite a bit of destratification, particularly in the oxygen, and you notice this during the fan cycles and ΔV|DELTA-V's, so we're going to be sure and we'll remind you again to stir up the oxygen prior to LOI. CMC is running along like clockwork. G&C tells us that the RCS quantities are looking good. You're using the same amount as predicted for your PTC and for your alignment. What we have in the way of a redline: we're going to tell you that you can use 30 percent per quad in lunar orbit. Now this is quite a bit of fuel to play with, and you can take 30 percent and subtract that from what you have to completion of LOI, and that will be a good number.
On the SPS, the oxidizer and fuel feed line temperatures are 75 and holding steady. The service module RCS quad package temps are cycling and holding between 120 and 140, and looks like we're getting good normal heater operations. We plan to have you in a 60-mile circular orbit after LOI 2. And we should have some PAD's for you on the LOI burn at about 67 hours.
Roger. We got all that.
Okay. We're still going through the tracking, and as you know, we're going to hold down on the water dumps and so forth during the last couple of hours in and out, sort of aid the tracking procedures. Everything is running along the line normally now. Do you have any other specific questions? We are looking for an angle on the moon. I guess that about summarizes the system. Everything looks GO right now.
Okay, Ken. Thank you. We just completed day 3 meal C, and now are going to break up and each take a rest period before LOI.
Okay, real fine. Everybody wanted to ask if you wouldn't try and get some sack time here before we go in. It's going to be a big day.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Finally found out where the moon is, and your present PTC attitude - if you happen to look out the right window as you go by - roll attitude of 320, it should be there.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. Bill would like to ask the doctor for permission to take a Seconal.
Okay. Standby.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. Did you call? We lost track for a minute.
Okay, Apollo 8. You're cleared to go ahead with that pill. Take - Surgeon recommends a small one.
Small one. Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. If you can, we'd like to have you stir up the oxygen cryo.
Okay, I'll do that right now. Just a moment, just the oxygen?
Okay. We want to get both the oxygen and hydrogen.
Just the oxygen, then?
No, sir; both the oxygen and the hydrogen.
Okay. Start, starting with the hydrogen.
Thank you.
Okay. Houston, Apollo 8. We've cycled through all of the cryo fans.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger. We had a momentary loss there.
How is the tracking?
Looking great.
How's the tracking data look, Ken?
Looking great.

Roger, Jim. One question - we talked about a P40 gimbal check. Would you like to do that during this maneuver to LOI 1 attitude, or would you rather hold that off until a little closer to LOI? Over.
Let me check on that. Wait one, Houston.
Roger. Standing by.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We could make this gimbal check as a maneuver to the LOI attitude.
Roger.
I understand that you'll load us up with the LOI 1 PAD and we'll run through P40 as far as the gimbal check.
Roger. That's what we heard you were going to do on it. Are you going to run both the manual gimbals as well as the automatic? Over.
Roger.

Okay, Jerry. At 67, we are going over to the LOI 1 attitude, do a sextant star check, and then we will have to go back to PTC. I want to know if you want us to go back to the same attitudes we are at now?
Apollo 8, Houston. That is affirmative, Frank. We are getting ready to ask you to do an erasable dump, VERB 47. We are ginning up to get ready for it now, and we will call you as soon as we are ready to copy.
Understand. VERB 47 when you call.
Negative; VERB 74.
Okay. VERB 74.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are setting up for the dump now. It will take about 3 minutes and 20 seconds once we start the dump. Over.
Understand.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Can you point out the position of this Zeta Persei to us a little better? We don't have it marked on our charts. We have got Mirfak, and we know Algol, but which one is Zeta Persei?
Roger, Frank. Persei Zeta is just about exactly between Aldebaran and Mirfak.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are ready for your CMC erasable dump. Key VERB 74 ENTER. Over.
Roger.
VERB 74 ENTER.
Did you get it?
Houston, Apollo 8. Are you getting the dump?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Indications are that we are getting it; we are checking. You will have to leave the computer alone for 3 minutes and 20 seconds. Over.
Roger. We are.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are getting your dump low bit rate through Honeysuckle.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Persei Zeta is a third magnitude star same as Enif. Over.
Same magnitude as Enif.
Affirmative.
Jerry, when are you going to send us the TEI 1 and the rest of that block data?
Apollo 8, Houston. PC plus 2 does not need an update. We'll have your TEI 1 and 2 in about 10 minutes. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. The dump is complete; you can have your computer back. The reason for the dump was to investigate further the P52 anomaly you had about 4 hours ago. We will try to have some words for you in about 20 or 30 minutes. Over.
You mean when it wouldn't come up with the proper star?
Affirmative.
Okay.
We are going to go ahead and start our maneuver to LOI 1 attitude.
Roger. Standing by to monitor.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Houston. Go ahead.
During the flight, I noticed that the AUTO optics wouldn't drive to the star pick-a-pair selected. Example, it picked Alpheratz at one time, wouldn't drive there, drove to a spot that had no star; and I went back and reselected the program and came back, and it worked okay.
Roger, Jim. Copy.
Jim, is this anomaly you are talking about - was that 4 hours ago when we did the REFSMMAT align?
This happened, I think, yesterday. When we - we were doing a regular REFSMMAT alignment. Alpheratz was the first star selected, and it didn't drive to Alpheratz; and I ran and reselected the program again, and it worked okay.
Okay, Jim. Thank you.
Jerry, this is Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8 here, Jerry.
Go ahead, Frank.
Our PAD here is - Roger. Our PAD here hasn't been correct. I understand the gimbal angles for LOI 1 are roll 0, pitch 200, and yaw 5. Is that correct?

Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We are ready to activate the primary water boiler.
Roger. Copy.
We got a GO?
Roger. GO.
Okay. Steam pressure going to AUTO; H<sub>2</sub> flow going to AUTO.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are on low bit rate. We won't see your steam pressure; your RAD OUT is 33. Over.
Roger. We're below the boiling limit, and steam pressure is steady at 0.15.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We have got our lunar map up and ready to go.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We're showing a fuel pressure of 167, in AUX of 163. Wondering, do you think there's a possibility of us having a transient caution warning trip on fuel AUX pressure at the beginning of the burn that would correct itself nominally as we had a chance to pressurize? Over.
Roger. Understand; will check. Stand by.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We've been reading fuel 173, AUX 167, holding steady for a long period of time. We expect no caution and warning trip. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Nine minutes 30 seconds from LOS.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. In about 10 seconds, we'll have you 19 minutes from ignition. Five, four, three, two, one -
MARK.
Apollo 8, Houston. Five minutes LOS, all systems GO. Over.
Thank you. Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. The custard is in the oven at 350. Over.
No comprendo.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Two minutes until LOS.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. One minute to LOS. All systems GO.
Roger. Going to COMMAND RESET, tape recorder FORWARD low bit rate.
Roger. Safe journey, guys.
Thanks a lot, troops.
We'll see you on the other side.
Apollo 8, 10 seconds to go. You're GO all the way.
Roger.

Go ahead, Houston. This is Apollo 8. Burn complete. Our orbit 160.9 by 60.5; 169.1 by 60.5.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Roger. 169.1 by 60.5. Good to hear your voice.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Verify your evaporator water control in AUTOMATIC. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, this is Houston, Houston. Over.
Roger, Houston. We read you loud and clear. How do you read us?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear now. And verify your evaporator water control panel switch to the AUTO position. Over.
Roger. I am sure it is in AUTO.
Roger.
Burn status report as follows: burn on time, burn time 4 minutes 6-1/2 seconds, VG<sub>X</sub> minus 1.4, attitude is nominal, no trim, VG<sub>Y</sub> was zero, VG<sub>Z</sub> was plus 0.2, ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 20.2, orbit 169.1 by 60.5.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. The burn on time, burn time of 4:06.5, VG<sub>X</sub> is minus 1.4.
Apollo 8, Houston. Verify your EVAP water control on panel 382 is AUTO. Your EVAP OUT temperature is high. Over.
Roger. Standing by.
Houston, Apollo 8. Roger. Primary EVAP is AUTO, H<sub>2</sub> flow AUTO. Do you recommend activating the secondary water boiler?
Roger. Copy. Stand by.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reverify manual valve on panel 382, evaporator water control AUTOMATIC. Over.
Roger. Verified.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Recommend you activate your secondary water evaporator.
Secondary EVAP coming on line.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Turn off your DSE, and we will go to high bit rate. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. And I will continue my readback of the burn status report. Copied VG<sub>X</sub> zero, VG<sub>Y</sub> zero, VG<sub>Z</sub> 1.2, ΔV|DELTA-V Charlie minus 20.2. Over.
Stand by; he's getting the chart out again.
ΔV|DELTA-VG<sub>Z</sub> was 0.2.
Roger. Understand; 0.2 on VG<sub>Z</sub>.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We are on malfunction 1 of 6, going through step 1 to step 2. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Copy.
Correction. That is to step 4.
Roger. Copy; to step 4.
Now to step 13.
Roger. Step 13.
Now to step 14.
Houston. Roger.
Looks like the boiler dried out somewhere along the line.
Roger, Bill.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. I would like to confirm that burn status report. VG<sub>X</sub> was minus 1.4, VG<sub>Y</sub> 0. VG<sub>Z</sub> 0.2, minus 0.2 that is. ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 20.2 -
Apollo 8, --
-- apogee 169.1, perigee 60.5.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Roger. I will read back again. The burn was on time, 4 minutes and 6-1/2 seconds, VG<sub>X</sub> minus 1.4, trim nominal, VG<sub>Y</sub> zero, VG<sub>Z</sub> minus 0.2, ΔV|DELTA-V Charlie minus 20.2. Over.
That's Roger.
Roger. And we copy your apogee and perigee.
Steam pressure is coming up.
Roger, Bill.
Step 15.
Roger. Concur.
Very good.
EVAP TEMP's coming down.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. We concur.
Okay. Houston, keep a good eye on it.
Roger. We're watching.
Okay. Nice job on the malfunction procedures.
Roger, Bill. Thanks.
You, too.
Give us a call when you think we ought to stop the secondary boiler, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Wilco.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. For information, we're passing over just to the side of the crater Langrenus at this time going into the Sea of Fertility.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. What does the ole moon look like from 60 miles? Over.
Okay, Houston. The moon is essentially gray, no color; looks like plaster of Paris or sort of a grayish deep sand. We can see quite a bit of detail. The Sea of Fertility doesn't stand out as well here as it does back on earth. There's not as much contrast between that and the surrounding craters. The craters are all rounded off. There's quite a few of them; some of them are newer. Many of them look like - especially the round ones - look like hits by meteorites or projectiles of some sort. Langrenus is quite a huge crater; it's got a central cone to it. The walls of the crater are terraced, about six or seven different terraces on the way down.
Roger. Understand.
And coming up now, the Sea of Fertility are the old friends Messier and Pickering that I looked about so much on earth.
Roger.
And I can see the rays coming out of blaze Pickering. We're coming up now near our P-1 initial site which I'm going to try and see. Be advised the round window, the hatch window, is completely iced over; we can't use it; Bill and I are sharing the rendezvous window.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Got any more information on those rays? Over.
Roger. The rays out of Pickering are quite faint from here; there are two different groups going to the left. They don't appear to have any depth to them at all, just rays coming out.
Roger.
They look like just changes in the color of the mare.
Bill, if you can tear yourself away from that window, we'd like you to turn off the secondary evaporator. Over.
Roger. Going OFF.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You can leave that secondary pump on for just a few minutes. Over.
Stand by.
Roger.
Okay. Over to my right are the Pyrenees Mountains coming up, and we're just about over Messier and Pickering right now. Our first initial point is easily seen from our altitude. We're getting quite a bit of contrast as we appear - as we approach the terminator. The view appears to be good, no reflection of the sun back to our eyes; it appears that visibility at this particular spot is excellent. It's very easy to pick out our first initial point; and over this mountain chain, we can see the second initial point, the Triangular Mountain.
And we're coming upon the craters Colombo and Gutenberg. Very good detail visible. We can see the long parallel faults or grabens, and they run through the Mare material right into the highland material.
We're directly over our first initial point now for P-1. It's almost impossible to miss, very easy to pick out, and we can look right over into the second initial point.
Roger, Jim.
I can see very clearly the five crater star formation which we had on our lunar chart --
Roger.
-- And right now, I'm trying to pick out visually P-1.
Roger, Jim. Bill, you can turn off the secondary EVAP pump now.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. How about giving us a system status, please?
Roger.
Okay. I've got P-1 in sight now, Houston.
Roger, Jim.
It's very easy to spot. You can see the entire rims of the craters from here with, of course, the white crescent on the far side where the sun is shining on it. The shadows are quite lengthy now. Maskelyne B (Marsh of Sleep) has quite a few shadows off of it, but it can be recognized. Just west of the Maskelyne B, we start going to the terminator. The terminator is actually quite sharp over the Pyrenees, and it's - I can't see anything in earthshine at this present time. Bill says that he can see things out the side window when he's not looking down on the sunshine on the moon.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. All systems are GO. We're evaluating the strip charts on your SPS burn, and we'll give you a readout on that shortly. Over.
Roger. Thank you. It seemed smooth. Do you need high bit rate any more?
Roger. We'd like high bit rate. We have dumped your DSE, and we'd like to stick with high bit rate for a while.
Roger.
Well, we're just about over Maskelyne B (Marsh Of Sleep) now, and our target is just directly below us.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. If you want the recorder now, it's yours.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. MSFN tracking is comparing very well with your onboard NAV.
Roger.
Houston, for your information, we lost radio contact at the exact second you predicted.
Roger. We concur.
Are you sure you didn't turn off the transmitters at that time?
Honest Injun, we didn't.
While these other guys are looking at the moon, I want to make sure we have a good SPS. How about giving me that report when you can?
Sure will, Frank.
We want a GO for every REV please; otherwise, we'll burn in TEI 1 at your direction.
Roger. I understand.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Are you eating?
Say again.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Are you eating dinner?
Negative. We'll have breakfast in a little while here.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. When you go into the dark in about 7 or 8 minutes, I have some words for you on the filters for the wide-angle lens, for your TV camera. Over.
We are in the dark now.
Roger. Let me know when you are ready to copy.
Apollo 8, Houston. Any words on earthshine? Over.
Earthshine is about as expected, Houston. Not as much detail, of course, as in the sunlight, but you can see the large craters quite distinctly, and you can see the albedo contacts quite distinctly. And, also, the - there's a good three-dimensional view of the rims of the larger craters.
Roger, Bill.
I think our high-speed film will be able to pick some of this stuff up quite well.
Roger.
Go ahead with your information on the filter, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. We recommend you use a wide-angle lens on this particular TV run. You can use a telephoto lens with the same setup as yesterday's TV show. However, we recommend a wide-angle lens. Step number 1, tape the single red filter to the red filter on the red/blue 0 filter holder; do it so that the filter slide still functions. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. Step number 2, attach the filter holder to the lens with the tape on the top and bottom; do this with the slide forward. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. Then at the end of your second REV TV pass, or on request from here, we would like you to remove that red filter from the holder and transmit briefly with it that way, then slide it over the blue side for your final transmission. Over.
We got you.
Okay, Frank.
Houston, Apollo 8. Standing by to record TEI 1 and TEI 2.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Your TEI 1 and TEI 2 PAD's you received last pass are still good. Using these PAD's, your next midcourse will be less than 20 feet per second. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have all the SPS experts looking at your data now. The preliminary look is very good, and we will give you some final words later.
Roger. We could feel the chug when we threw in BANK B, not a chug, but we could feel additional thrust.
Roger. Copy.
Houston, be advised on this red/blue filter technique on the TV. You cannot slide the two filters out of the way with them taped onto the TV camera; so I suggest we do red, blue, and then take them off.
Roger. We concur, but make sure the little red filter is taped over the big one. Over.
Alright, you don't want the red fil - you want the blue by itself. Is that correct?
That's affirmative, Bill.
Bill, we'd like you to use the double red filter for the first transmission. Over.
Roger. It worked.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. If you should decide that you want to roll heads up on REV 2, one thing to remember, be sure you yaw 45 degrees right in order to maintain your high-gain antenna COMM. Over.
We will not do that; we're going to stick with the flight plan, and make the best we can here.
Roger, Frank.
As usual, in the real world, the flight plan looks a lot fuller than it did in Florida.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. We need an O<sub>2</sub> purge now.
Roger. And we're standing by for a map update.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Just for your information, after we completed P52, I acquired the earth in the sextant. Quite a sight from here.
Roger. Bet it is.
Row are the systems experts on the SPS coming, Jerry?
They are still working, Frank; another 5 or 10 minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Your SPS data looks real good. It is just a matter of getting it all in from the site and getting it looked at.
Thank you.
So far, everything looks copacetic.
Apollo 8, Houston. We would like to take about 5 minutes of high bit rate. Over.
Roger. Five minutes of high bit rate coming on.
Roger.
You've got it.
Apollo 8, Houston with a map update.
Stand by one.
Go ahead with the map update.
Roger, Frank. Map update: REV 1/2, no change; the REV 2/3 follows: 73:04:57, 73:09:37, 73:19:01, 73:48:53, 74:24:23; remarks: Bravo 1 [03:02:16:24|74:16:24]. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Roger. We show you 23 minutes to LOS.
Roger. Are you going to dump the tape?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You are GO for REV 2; all systems are GO. SPS evaluation is still underway and looking good. Over.
Understand; GO for REV 2. Thank you.
Roger, Apollo 8. We're still using the tape recorder. We will dump it in a little bit.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. The recorder is yours. You can go to low bit rate.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Request BIOMED switch center.
Three, two, one -
MARK.
Roger. Mark.
Apollo 8, Houston. Put your TELEMETRY INPUT switch to LOW. Over.
Roger. GO in LOW.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're in the process of preparing meal 4, day - correction: day 4, meal A.
Roger, Frank.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Are you going to be able to dump that tape prior to LOS?
Roger. Bill, they say they have already dumped the tape, and it's almost totally clean.
What does that mean?
That means you have got about 2 minutes of low bit rate on there, but the rest is clean. Over.
The high bit rate of the burn wasn't on there?
Negative. We've already dumped and got that.
Okay. Let me know when you're going to dump it next time, Jerry. I understand we are GO now on the DSE. Have you got any voice off of it?
That's affirmative. We did.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. The voice quality on your tape was just fair-to-middling; we were able to monitor your burn and hear most of that pretty well.
Roger. Did you get a report of the photography accomplished, or is that on the tape at present?
Negative. We haven't heard that.
Okay. We will put it on the tape now.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. You are 4 minutes and 40 seconds away from LOS. I would like a reconfirmation on your S-band AUX switch in the DOWN-VOICE BACKUP position. Over.
Negative; it is in the NORMAL voice. We will go DOWN-VOICE BACKUP.
Roger. Request you leave it there forever. Over.
Roger. In DOWN-VOICE BACKUP now.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. All systems are GO. You're still GO for REV 2. Over.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. One minute to LOS.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Ten seconds to LOS. All systems are GO.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Houston, this is Apollo 8 with the TV going. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. We see your TV. It is a little bit - little bit clearer.
Roger. The moon is very bright and not too distinct in this area. I will give you a shot of the horizon.
Roger.
How's that look? Is it on the top of your picture?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. It's a good picture - the horizon - we can't see many terrain features as yet.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are beginning to pick up a few craters very dimly; the whole thing is pretty bright.
Roger. There is not much definition up here either out on the horizon. We are now approaching the craters See and Bassett.
Roger.
I'll shift to the rendezvous window.
Roger, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston. We want to take the DSE.
Roger. You've got it.
Roger. Looks like we've got a real good picture now.
Okay. That's the crater Brand.
Roger.
Sorry we missed Carr.
Me, too.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are going to need a cryo fan cycle sometime during this pass.
Roger. Can we wait till sunset?
Roger. We can wait.
Okay. I think we are coming up on Miller right now.
There's a very new bright impact crater; should be in the field of view now.
Roger, Bill.
You see it in the upper part of your screen.
Say, Bill, how would you describe the color of the moon from here?
The color of the moon looks like a very whitish gray, like dirty beach sand with lots of footprints in it.
Some of these craters look like pickaxes striking concrete leaving a lot of fine haze dust.
There's some interesting features out on the other window. Let me switch windows on you now.
Roger, Bill.
You should see the horizon now in the top of your picture.
Roger. We have the horizon, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston.
I believe these are the craters now Bassett and See.
Roger, Bill. If you have the polarizing filter handy, try flipping it in front, would you?
Roger.
Jerry, as a matter of interest, there's a lot of what appears to be very small new craters that have these little white rays radiating from them.
Roger, Jim.
Roger. We see the filter going over it. Apollo 8, this is Houston. Looks like we have too much light. The polarizing filter doesn't help much. Go ahead and remove it again.
Roger. It's removed.
Looks like we just got --
Roger. We're just passing over the crater Borman, and there's Anders out there; Lovell is right south of it.
Roger. The TV is breaking up now. Okay. We are back with a good picture. Looks like we just have too much light. Our definition is rather weak.
Roger.
Also, we're fogging up the window here, Houston, among other problems.
Roger, Bill. The other window is better than that one.
Okay.
Much better picture, Bill; much better.
Alright. The right side of the camera is pointing retrograde. We are now passing abeam of the crater Houston; I will show the camera over there once for the folks in Texas.
Roger.
It's a big and sprawly one; it's got those two impact craters, one to the right and one to the left.
Roger, Bill.
How's your picture?
Still about the same, Bill. It's - the terrain's pretty bright. We are not getting much definition at all; definition on this side is much much better.
Okay. I think - Okay. We are leaving the window; that gives you an idea how bad our window is.
Roger. This picture now is much better; I guess the light levels are decreasing now.
Okay. We are coming up on the crater Collins.
Roger. What crater is that just going off.
That's some small impact crater.
Roger.
We will call it John Aaron's.
Okay.
If he'll keep looking at the systems anyway.
He just quit looking.
Jerry, another ID feature: these small impact craters have dark spots in the center where it appears that they buried in it and hit some new material down below and scattered a lot of fine white dust around them.
Roger. Understand, Jim.
Apollo 8. This is Houston. Looks like we can see Collins now.
Roger. There is Collins for you.
And Collins is right on the edge of Smythe's Sea which we are about to pass over.
Roger.
Apollo 8. This is --
We are now going across the Smythe Sea. Go ahead.
Roger. We just saw a Stellenword go by.
Roger. He was really in a hurry.
Roger. Picture is much improved now; getting better all the time.
Roger. The terrain here is, as you can see, not well defined. We are going to start a roll to the left, in order to come across the target area, with the television --
Roger.
-- landing site area.
Roger, Bill.
How is that crater in - right in the middle look now?
Roger. That's a very good one; that must be O'Neal.
Roger.
Roger, Bill. We see O'Neal real well, also the smaller crater off to the side of it.
That's Dennis.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We are going to terminate our program for this pass and get on with the preparations for LOI 2, if you say we are GO.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Roger.
Okay. Signing off until ninth rev. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Thank you for the look.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You have the DSE.
Thank you, Houston.
Roger. Apollo 8, on your backside data, it's pretty much unintelligible. We suggest, Bill, that you recheck the position of your mike for your backside pass and try to speak a little bit louder and more distinctly. The last one we listened to, was pretty much unintelligible. Over.
Roger. As soon as we get squared away, we will give you a real quick real time summary.
Roger.
And, Houston, you might let us know, can we do the red/blue filter exercise with both these filters - red filters on? Over.
Stand by.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Apollo 8, Houston. Negative.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with an LOI 2 maneuver PAD. Ready to copy?

Apollo 8, this is Houston. Your map update for REV 2/3, no change. Over.
Understand. No change, REV 2/3.
Roger, Frank. You can expect GO/NO-GO for the next rev at 20 minutes before LOS. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We'll try to make that call 20 minutes before every LOS. Over.
Fine.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have the CSM vector in starting on the LV. Over.
Thank you.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Just an interesting feature: on my center window which has ice on it, it is now beginning to melt. I'm beginning to see through it.
Roger. That's good news.
And again we're directly over our favorites, Messier and Pickering.
The view at this altitude, Houston, is tremendous. There is no trouble picking out features that we learned on the map.
Roger. Jim, that's good news. What do you think of the lighting situation as far as the range of lighting for good visibility?
The range from here is outstanding. I wish we had the TV still going because the brown area now is darker. We have just passed over the Sea of Fertility, and the mare is darker. The mountain range has got more contrast, has more contrast because of the sun angle. Bill's got the 16 mm going for us.
Roger.
There is a crater Taruntius, I believe, over there.
We will try to get TV on this at a later time, when we are not getting ready for a burn.
Roger, Jim.
I can see the old second bishop right now, Mount Marilyn.
Roger.
Houston, at these sun angles, everything is quite distinct; shadows are good; the ground doesn't have any sunlight returned. It appears very good visibility at these sun angles.
Roger.
As a matter of fact, Bill just mentioned that the visibility seems to be excellent just about up to the terminator. It's something which I didn't expect. I thought there would be a little bit more gradual shift to darkness, but it's very sharp and distinct.
Roger, Jim.
Of course, we are in a very high phase angle now.
Apollo 8, Houston. All of your updates are in; the computer is yours. Over.
Thank you.

Go ahead - or Houston, this is Apollo 8. TEI 3 with LOI 2. SPS/G&N 45810, minus 053, plus 141 075:21:28.46, plus 30128, minus 00540, plus 01911 180 019 001, NA plus 00188 30193 255 30008 40 2742 396 033, down 021, left 18, plus 0888, minus 16500 12955 36185 146:34:50; no change, no change 1 degree in the rise of ignition minus three, assumes LOI 2.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. I made one mistake; horizon window is minus 1 degree. Over.
Minus 1 degree.
Roger. Readback is correct.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You are GO across the board for LOI 2. Would like to take the DSE for a dump. Over.
Roger. You got it. I understand we are GO for LOI 2.
That's affirmative.
Before you take the DSE for a dump, let me give you a quick - let me give you a quick rundown on the DSE before you dump it, if you will.
Roger. Standing by.
Roger.
Okay, Houston. You've got the tape.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Would you believe that Taurus, Aida is Pleaides? Over.
Thank you.
Have you got that tape dumped, Houston? We're about to lose the high gainer.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're dumping now - looks like we'll be 5 or 10 more minutes.
Try to get it dumped, and I'll play it, rewind it if necessary -
Roger. Copy.
We are about to lose it, Houston. How far are you on the tape dump?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. It looks like we have lost it. They weren't quite done. We are standing by for a countdown to BIOMED switch left. Over.
Roger.
Look, we would like to get it dumped if we could. Standby a second.
Okay.
Did you get it stopped?
Bill, you can go ahead and turn it off.
Okay. We are not going to have a high gain now until the next time around. Can you give me some idea of how much of that pass you got.
Apollo 8. this is Houston. We - negative. We can't tell. You can go ahead and turn it off.
Well, how long did you - did you dump it?
Roger. stand by; they are checking.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston reading you with a great deal of noise in the background. Go ahead and rewind your tape and start it in low bit rate, and we will try to catch that dump at the end of the next rev.
Roger. I would like to have an idea on how much you dumped. So I know whether ... all these things or whether we have better setting in.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are working on that time. We should be able to tell you before LOS. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. Did you read my last?
That is affirmative. You will give us a run-down when you figure out how much tape you dumped.
Roger. They feel reasonably sure, however, that if you rewind and start low bit rate, we'll be able to get all of the burn and still not run into what needs to be down linked yet.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. What REFSMMAT are we using for this LOI 2 burn?
Stand by, Frank. We're talking.
Okay. I notice an LOI 2 REFSMMAT. If it is, I don't understand why the pitch is 175.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You are right; the REFSMMAT is LOI 2. The REFSMMAT was determined out there before the last midcourse correction, and since that time, there has been a slight change of trajectory, and the point at which you are burning LOI 2 now is just a shade different than where it was originally planned. Over.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. DSE is rewound, and it's yours - available for use is about 1 hour of low bit rate and 2 minutes of high bit rate for your burn, without running over your good data. Over.
Roger. Do you read us now, Houston?
Roger. Reading you loud and clear now.
Okay.
Apollo. 8, this is Houston. You are GO for LOI 2 on the next rev. Over.
I can understand GO for LOI 2 on the next rev.
How do you read, Houston?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear.
Roger. Frank, did you get my message on the DSE?
Roger. Roger.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Verify the TELEMETRY INPUT switch LOW. Over.
Roger. Understand; TELEMETRY INPUT LOW.
Affirmative.
Going to LOW; it was in HIGH.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Five minutes to LOS. Over.
Thank you, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. One minute to LOS; all systems GO. Over.
Apollo 8. Roger.
So long.
Adios. See you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. How me?
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Reading you loud and clear and ready for the burn status report.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Roger. The burn was on time, 11 seconds, 0.2 with a VG<sub>X</sub>, 1.8 VG<sub>Y</sub>; that's minus 1.8, minus 0.2 VG<sub>Z</sub>. ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> was minus 9.4; VERB 82 gives us an apogee 62 and a perigee of 60.8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Roger. Your burn was on time, 11 seconds; VG<sub>X</sub> was plus 0.2, VG<sub>Y</sub> was minus 1.8, VG<sub>Z</sub> minus 0.2, ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> minus 9.4, apogee 62, perigee 60.8. Over.
Roger.
Houston, how do you read? This is Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Weak but clear.
You are loud and clear.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're on high gain now if you want to get the high-speed data to look at that burn.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are taking the DSE.
Thank you. Can you hold it for about 5 seconds - or about 1 minute?
Roger. Holding.
Okay. Okay. You can dump the data now.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. We are taking the DSE for dump.
Thank you. We have - updated the LM state vector with the VERB 66, Houston.
Houston. Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Hello, Michael.
Hey, good morning, Frank. We've been tracking you for about 18 minutes now, and we show your orbit 61 by 61-1/2. Over.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Your SPS engine looked good on LOI number 2 burn.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Bill has got the tape recorder now; we are evaluating the dump. The data is good, and we are evaluating the voice quality here shortly.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
I've got a few jolly updates for you when you are ready to copy.
Stand by.
Go ahead, Houston, with your updates.
Roger. Apollo 8, Houston. I have a TEI 3, TEI 4, and map update for REV 3 and 4 to read to you. Actually the TEI 3 update which you have on board is still valid, but we will not update that one. Which do you want first, the TEI 4 or the map update?
TEI 4.
Alright. This is the TEI 4 update: SPS/G&N 45695, minus 053, plus 141. Are you with me so far? Over.
So far.
Very good. 077:21:27.58, plus 30627, minus 00625, plus 00577 180 018 001, not applicable, plus 00188 30639 256 30452. Are you with me so far? Over.
So far seems ... hold it a minute though, will you?
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. The last number I gave was ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub>. Picking up at the sextant star: 40 2730 396 033, down 030, left 19. Are you with me? Over.
Roger.
Okay. Plus 0858, minus 16500 12960 36195 146:37:21; comments: north set of stars Sirius and Rigel, roll 129, pitch 155, yaw 010, ullage two quad, 20 seconds, two-zero seconds from quads Bravo and Delta; horizon on 2-degree line at tine of ignition minus 3 minutes. Over.
Roger, Houston. We got a TEI 4 SPS/G&N 45695, minus 053 plus 141 077:21:27.58, plus 30627, minus 00625, plus 00577 180 018 001, NA, plus 00188 30639 256 30452 40 2730 396 033, down 030, left 19, plus 0858, minus 16500, plus 12960, plus 36195 146:37:21; Sirius, Rigel, 129 155 010, two quads, 20 seconds B and D, horizon 2 degrees at TIG minus 3.
That's about the size of it, Frank, and a map update for REV's 3/4 when you are ready.
Ready.
REV's 3/4: LOS 75:01:23, sunrise 75:10:16, prime meridian 75:17:16, AOS 75:47:18, sunset 76:23:11; remarks: subsolar point 75:46:55, IP-1 acquisition 76:11:17, IP-2 acquisition 76:12:30. For IP-1 and 2, those ACQ times are for shaft and trunnion angles equals zero. Over.
Roger. Thank you. 75:01:23 75:10:16 75:17:16 75:47:18 76:23:11, subsolar 75:46:55, IP-1 76:11:17, IP-2 76:12:30, and at shaft and trunnion at 0.
That's affirmative, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. When Bill gets a minute, we'd like to get battery B started charging. Over.
Roger. Thank you. He'll take a minute right now.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go.
Roger. For Bill - the voice quality on the backside DSE is extremely poor. We consider it unusable, and we recommend that all pertinent comments be hand recorded so we don't lose them. We should not count on using the tape at low bit rate for voice.
Okay, Houston. We're getting so busy that we are having a hard time trying to do a neat job of logging. I'll try to do it on the flight plan; and if I make any visual observations, we'll put them on the DSE, and I'll try to scribble some notes here and there.
Roger. Understand. Now high bit rate is working great.
Roger.
Hey, Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
How about giving us the TV times for the ninth REV, will you please?
Yes, we sure will, Frank. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We were checking into precise start and stop times for TV, and you are GO for the next REV. Over.
I understand; go for the next REV. Mike, we'd like to, if we could, time the TV to a passing over the terminator. We would like to track the terminator with the TV; think that's the most impressive thing we've seen, and that might be the best thing rather than trying to acquire the earth.
Okay, Frank. That's one of the things we are looking at right now. We have you ending at about 86 hours, and we're looking at extending that few minutes to include that terminator view. Over.
Okay. I don't want us to run into REV 10 very much at all, though.
Roger. Understand.
Houston; Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
... since the DSE qual is not so good. How do you read, Mike?
I read you loud and clear. You were cut out about the DSE. Say again.
Roger. Since the qual isn't so good, let me give you a quick rundown of the status of photo targets. You ready to copy?
Ready to copy.
Okay. At REV 1, we got photo target 90 and terminator photography south for near-side terminator. Starting on REV 2, we've got target 12 and targets 10, 14, 16, 19, 20, 21, and 23. Unfortunately, we got into a high - I got into the high-speed film there somewhere, and I think those 250mm targets were on high speed. We did change film, and starting out in Tex - Crater, Texas, with target 28, 31, 40, 36, plus several targets of opportunity that were recorded on the DSE, but apparently lost. Have you been able to copy?
Yes, I'm with you, Bill. Keep going.
Okay. I might be calling up too fast. Okay. On the third REV, we got target 58 and 63 and 65. The training photography was accomplished, and it was done on magazine D, which now has - correction, that's magazine E - which now shows 95 exposures. Magazine D is fresh. Magazine K was also used for training photography, and it's showing 0.51.
Roger. We copy all that, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston.
... Mike, this is Frank again.
Go ahead,Frank.
Go ahead.
Roger for Bill.
... around.
Apollo 8, Houston standing by.
I said is Rod Rose around?
Stand by one, Frank; we'll look for him, and while we're doing that, for Bill the DSE voice quality on high bit rate is very good, so if he wants to use the DSE in high bit rate for a limited amount of time to record important things, we suggest that he do that. We would like him to wait 20 seconds after turning it on prior to talking. Over.
Roger. Copy.
Thank you, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Rod Rose is sitting up in the viewing room; he can hear what you say.
I wonder if he is ready for experiment P1?
He says thumbs up on P1.
Houston, with reference to the DSE on high bit rate, what I would like to do this is - if you got the last pass - I'd like to play it - run it back and start at AOS on low bit rate and then go to high when we need it. How would that be?
John Aaron buys it.
Okay, Mike. This is Frank again.
Go.
Roger. Rod and I got together, and I was going to record a little - say a little prayer for our church service tonight. And I wonder - I guess that's what we are ready on?
Stand by one, Frank.
Alright.
Houston, Apollo 8. Are you still there?
You're still loud and clear, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead, Frank, with your message.
Okay. This is to Rod Rose and the people at St. Christopher's, actually to people everywhere. Give us, O God, the vision which can see thy love in the world, in spite of human failure. Give us the faith to trust the goodness in spite of our ignorance and weakness. Give us the knowledge that we may continue to pray with understanding hearts, and show us what each one of us can do to set forth the coming of the day of universal PEACE. Amen.
Amen.
I was supposed to lay-read tonight, and I couldn't quite make it.
Roger. I think they understand.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Frank, we'd like to know about the water chlorination. Have you - when was the last time you chlorinated the water? Over.
About an hour and a half ago; we've already done it.
Roger. We copy you an hour and a half ago. Affirmative?
Roger. You know we wouldn't forget that.
Roger.
Jim spilled a little, and it smelled like a bucket of Clorox about an hour ago.
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
I said Jim inadvertently spilled some of that chlorine, and it smelled like a bucket of Clorox in here for a little while.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We have two and a half minutes to LOS, and all systems are looking good. Everything is looking just fine down here, Frank.
Thank you.
We'll have some more information on the TV on the next rev. We're not planning any big change in the time, just to extend them a little bit, I think, closer to the terminator.
Just give us the time, will you, because we just want to know when it is. I'd like to get the terminator if we could, and we've got a little message, and that's it.
Roger. We'll do that the next time you come around.
Thank you. Okay. And have the EECOM guys keep a sharp watch on our systems. Old Anders is so busy fooling around with these pictures that - not much else is getting done.
Roger. The EECOM is doing that.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 here.
Roger. We have been having a little antenna problem on the ground here. We are reading you now with a lot of noise in the background. How me?
Loud and clear, Michael.
Roger. Frank, we are still trying to get a little bit better COMM here. Stand by; you're unreadable.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Loud and clear, Houston. Apollo 8.
I understand you are reading us loud and clear; we are barely reading you. Would you go to P00 in ACCEPT, please? We are going to send you a P27 update.
Roger. Going to P00 and to ACCEPT, Houston.
We are in P00 and ACCEPT.
Apollo 8, Houston. You are not readable. We are going to delay the P27 until we get a little bit better lock on you.
As long as you're reading me okay, Frank, I'll bring you up to date on a couple of things. The P27 which we will be sending you is a state vector update going to the LM slot, and we'd like to - as per plan - to transfer that to the CSM slot by a VERB 47 ENTER, and we would like to just remind you that prior to doing your VERB 47 ENTER manually select P00 and wait for the computer activity light to go out. Did you copy? Over.
Roger. Roger. We copy.
Okay, Frank. Are you still reading me loud and clear? Over.
Roger. Loud and clear.
Alright. I'll go ahead with a map update when you're ready to copy.
Okay. Can you hold off a minute?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. How are you reading now?
Go ahead, Houston. This is Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with a map update. Are you ready to copy?
Just a minute, Mike.
Roger. Apollo 8, Houston. Your map update for REV 4/5: LOS 76:59:59, sunrise 77:09:06, prime meridian 77:15:47, AOS 77:45:50, sunset 78:22:03; IP-1 position time for control point 2, 77:29:42; IP-1 time closest approach for target B-1, 78:10:25. Over.
We'll have to get that data later on.
We'll try it again later, Frank.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Do you want to take this NAV sighting?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger, Houston. How do you read?
Reading you a lot better, Bill. How are you reading me?
I'm reading you five - loud and clear, and you copying our low bit data to record these tracking passes? Over.
That is affirmative. We are getting low bit data now.
Okay. I've played - run the tape recorder back to the beginning. We have quite a bit of high bit, so all you'll have to do is start recording when you are ready.
Roger. Stand by one, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston. Stand by one on the tape recorder dump. We would like you to look at your steam pressure. We think that the primary evaporator may have dried out, and if the steam pressure shows off-scale low, would you please close the back pressure valve and reservice the evaporator? Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are ready to send you the P27 LM state vector update when you are ready. Over.
You will have to wait until this tracking exercise is over with, Mike.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Were you calling? Over.
Roger. You can go ahead now and give you computer and get the updates, and let's get going on the PAD messages.
Roger.
It is in P00 and ACCEPT.
Okay, Houston. Are you ready to talk about the water boiler problem?
Roger. We copy you in P00 and ACCEPT, and we are sending you a P27 LM state vector. On the water boiler, it looks to us like the evaporator has been reserviced. How does it look to you? Over.
Roger. I reserviced it, put it to AUTO - H<sub>2</sub>O flow to AUTO; and the steam pressure went to zero again. So I tried reservicing it the second time for 1 minute, and again no results. I'm in the present process of closing the back pressure valve manually. Over.
Roger. Understand you tried to reservice it twice, both times steam pressure has gone to zero, and now you are closing the back pressure valve manually.
Roger. Each time I have reserviced it, the steam pressure came up to about 0.07 to 0.1; but as soon as the steam and water were put to AUTO, the steam pressure went right back down again.
Roger. We copy, and we are reading you loud and clear now, Bill. On your map update, did you copy that that I gave you previously?
Negative. We have not copied it yet.
Negative.
Okay. I have it for you again when you are ready to copy.
Ready to copy.
This is a map update for REV's 4/5: LOS 76:59:59, sunrise 77:09:06, prime meridian 77:15:47, AOS 77:45:50, sunset 78:22:03; remarks: IP-1, acquisition time for CP2 is 77:29:42, IP-1 time closest approach for target B-1 78:10:25. Over.
Roger. LOS 76:59:59, sunrise 77:09:06, 77:45:47, 77:45:50, 78:22:03; IP-1, CP2 77:29:42, IP-1 TCA for B-1 78:10:25.
That's right, and the prime meridian time is 77:15:47, and you got your computer back. We've got a good P27 update.
Okay. We will go to P00 and TRANSFER.
Roger.
Houston, do you have a TEI 5 for us?
We are working on it now, Frank. Have it for you momentarily.
Roger.
Apollo 8. Houston.
Go.
Roger. On your back pressure valve, we would like to know how long after you closed the back pressure valve the first time - how long it was from the time you closed it until the time you started the reservicing? We would like for you to wait about 15 minutes to prevent any ice from forming due to flash freezing. Over.
Okay. I started immediately to reservice it.
Apollo 8, Houston. We show that you closed it this last time about 4 minutes ago, so we would like you to wait another 15 minutes and then try to reservice it again at that time and then go to AUTO. Over.
Roger.
Roger. Thank you. The TEI 4 PAD which you have is still valid. We will have a TEI 5 PAD for you shortly.
Roger. Be advised we are presently in steam pressure MANUAL, and we're in H<sub>2</sub>O flow AUTO, and are now in H<sub>2</sub>O flow OFF, as of about 5 seconds ago.
Roger. We copy that, Bill. And we confirm that's a good configuration.
Right now, I've got the H<sub>2</sub> flow OFF. Do we stay that way?
Affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston. On your television update, we propose that you start the TV at the flight plan time of 85 hours 37 minutes and simply extend the stop time a few minutes. You're currently scheduled to stop at 86 hours, and we would like to keep it going until the terminator, which should be approximately 86:14. Over.
Roger.
Frank, I know you are busy up there. We've got the daily news for you whenever and if ever you'd like to hear it.
I'll give you a call.
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
Go ahead.
I have the TEI 5 PAD for you whenever you are ready to copy.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. TEI 5, SPS/G&N: 47 correction - 45701, minus 043, plus 116 079:21:26.03. Are you with me so far?
Roger.
Plus 31171, minus 00767, minus 00214 180 017 001, not applicable, plus 00188 31181 259 31003. Are you with me? Over.
Roger.
Roger. 40 2711 398 033, down 043, left 23, plus 0832 minus 16500 12956 36208 146:39:44; north set of stars remain Sirius and Rigel; roll, pitch, and yaw remain same angles: 129 155 010, ullage remains two quads for 20 seconds, quads B and D; horizon on 4-degree line at TIG minus 3 minutes. Over.
Roger. Here we go: TEI 5, SPS/G&N 45701, minus 043, plus 116 079:21:26.03, plus 31171, minus 00767, minus 00214 180 017 001, NA, plus 00188 31181 259 31003 40 2711 398 033, down 043, left 23, plus 0832, minus 16500, plus 12956 36208 146:39:44. Set stars are the same; ullage - we'd like - do you have any objection to using four quads for 15 seconds?
No objection to four-quad ullage, Apollo 8.
Okay. We'd like to just go ahead and use four quads all times, unless we get a lot shorter on fuel than we are now.
Understand.
And is that 15 seconds?
Affirmative: 15 seconds, four quads.
Apollo 8 - -
Thank you, and horizon is 4 degrees at minus - -
That readback is correct, Frank, and we'd like to advise that the voice quality on that high bit rate is excellent. Over.
Thank you. Mike, it's four quads for 15 seconds. Is that right?
That is affirmative, Apollo 8: four quads for 15 seconds.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger for Bill. He can go ahead and do his standard reservice on the water now. It's looking good.
Okay. You want us to reservice it now?
That's affirmative, and upon completion, go back to AUTO.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We are still dumping your tapes. The voice quality on high bit is coming through superb, and you are GO for the next rev. And we would like to get a brief status report on your rest between 60 hours and LOI 1, just to fill in some information for us.
We only got a couple hours rest.
Okay.
We're tired right now, but we will have to wait until TEI before we get back to the regular cycle.
Alright. I suspect you're right.
Okay, Houston. The water boiler has been reserviced, back pressure valve CLOSED for 1 minute, water ON for 2, and it's now steam pressure AUTO, H<sub>2</sub>O flow AUTO.
Roger. We copy, Bill.
If we have a problem, a similar problem, again on the back side in the sunlight, might be a good idea to crank the secondary loop until we have AOS. What do you think about that?
Stand by one, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Jim. In regard to your evaporator, we feel that if you do have a similar problem next time on the back side in sunlight, check the evaporator outlet temperature, and if it gets above 60, we concur that it would be a good idea to bring up the secondary loop. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. When we say bring up the secondary loop, we mean bring up the evaporator only on the secondary loop. Copy?
Roger.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. We got time for a little news?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
I say how about a little bit of that news you promised?
Roger. We got the Interstellar Times here, the December 24 edition. Your TV program was a big success. It was viewed this morning by most of the nations of your neighboring planet; the earth. It was carried live all over Europe, including even Moscow and East Berlin, also in Japan and all of North and Central America and parts of South America. We don't know yet how extensive the coverage was in Africa. Are you copying me all right? Over.
You are loud and clear.
Good. San Diego welcomed home today the Pueblo crew in a big ceremony. They had a pretty rough time of it in the Korean prison. Christmas cease-fire is in effect in Viet Nam, with only sporadic outbreaks of fighting. And if you haven't done your Christmas shopping by now, you better forget it.
Thank you.
A couple of Oilers made the All-Star team, Webster and Farr.
Roger.
And that's about all our news. How about your news?
Well, we'll be looking forward to a big burn here shortly.
Roger.
Mike, I think I can say it without contradiction, it's been a mighty long dry spell up here.
I guess you can say anything you like without contradiction.
When can we dump water, Houston?
Say again, Frank.
When can we dump water?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go, Houston.
We will get you the number after a while on your water dump. It looks like the quantity isn't increasing very slightly, and we're considering not only the quantity in regard to the dump, but also its effects on the trajectory relative to TEI and so forth, but we will have a good answer for you shortly.
We are not just thinking about the waste water tank: we're thinking about some other kind of water that has to get dumped out of the spacecraft, slightly used water.
Roger. We understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We have about three and a half minutes to LOS. We give you back the DSE under your control, and in regard to your water dump, we are tentatively predicting a waste water tank dump at about 80 hours GET and any other dumps are at your discretion, any time you would like to make them.
Thank you.
People listening to the high bit rate down here say it's like sitting in your living room listening to good hi-fi.
Sounds like a good idea.
Apollo 8, Houston. Coming up on 2 minutes to LOS. We got a good reservice on the primary evaporator, and everything is still looking very good down here.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. One minute to LOS. Are you still reading us loud and clear?
Loud and clear. Loud and clear.
Okay, fine. We've been noticing a little bit of increase in our background noise as you approach backside.
Roger. We had to go off the high gain. That's why.
Roger.
Have a good backside; we'll see you next time around.
Okay, Mike.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. Welcome back.
Roger. Looks like the evaporator - looks like the evaporator is holding okay, or at least it is trying to. It dropped the temperature down to about 32, and now it's come back up again and stabilized at about 42 degrees.
Roger. Copy you, Bill.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. Houston, this is Apollo 8. What we are doing on the control point tracking - I managed to look for a CP-1 at the same time we were trying to do a CP-2 on this rev. I picked up two marks which are just as small, but more easily recognizable, than the ones that were given to me. I know that I can repeat the process and pick the same small point on the next rev. Now I can try to look for the control points that are written down, but I think that I have better control over the ones that we have.
Roger, Jim. Understand. We'll check that for you.
Roger. One more point: the control point times which you have given me are a little bit off, and I can notice by comparing these maps that these maps are not too well aligned either.
Roger. These two small points that you can repeat your marks on: will you be able to identify those precisely on a map? Over.
That's affirmative; that is why I picked them. They are both - they're both very prominent features, and they are both very small craters about the same size as the ones we are looking for, but I can pinpoint them on a map.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. One more comment: as it offered a lot of controversy at data priority meetings, it looks like 10 degrees pitch up is the best attitude to obtain the horizon so that you can follow the landmark down through the scanning telescope. If you pitch down any more, full up trunnion will not get the horizon, and the horizon is a great help in leading yourself into the control point.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, we concur with your use of the two small craters which you can repeatedly mark on and find on the map; and also if you will give us your new latitudes and longitudes, we can compute for you a time of closest approach to those points with the spacecraft 10 degrees pitched-up. Over.
Roger, Houston. CP-1 latitude minus 606269, longitude over 2, minus 78954, altitude plus 00152; for CP-2 latitude minus 09638, longitude over 2, plus 81691, altitude minus 00007. I tried to get CP-3 at the same pass, but I let it go by to get set up for this first track at the landing site.
Roger, Houston. CP-1: would you say again the latitude, and on CP-2, say again the longitude CP-2, please?
Roger. CP-1 latitude minus 06269; that is the latitude; and for longitude over 2 for CP-2, plus 81691.
Okay. We copied them. Thank you.
And it appears that resolve medium is a very good combination to track.
Roger. I understand. Resolve medium.
And it appears so far, Houston, that no spacecraft pitch motion is required to get five marks on the target in plenty of time.
Roger. I understand you require no spacecraft motion to get five marks.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. I am about 15 minutes early with the TEI fix update and the map update. I will have them here whenever it's convenient for you to copy.
Okay. Just a little bit, Mike.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We would like to ask you to stop using AUTO OPTICS on the pseudo landing site. It's necessary that we send you up a P27 to update the RLS values stored in the computer. Over.
Roger. I found ... I went to MANUAL OPTICS on B-1.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. If you would go to P00 and ACCEPT, please, we are going to send you a P27 load which will update an RLS value which will be followed by a procedural change, Jim, we will give you later; and AUTO OPTICS should be working shortly.
Roger. Or I could use no landmark AUTO OPTICS instead of the code.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are also sending you up a state vector update at the same time.
Okay. We will be expecting that.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're taking the DSE for a dump. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We would like to take Bill's DSE for a dump. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're ready for the - your updates, your PAD's.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. I have updates, a map update for REV 5/6, and TEI 6 update. Which would you like first?
Okay. I've got the map update page now. Why don't you give me that one?
Okay. Map update for REV 5/6. LOS 78:58:49, sunrise 79:08:07, prime meridian 79:14:30, AOS 79:44:36, sunset 80:21:05; IP-1, time of closest approach to target B-1 80:09:00. Now your two new control points that Jim gave us: control point number 1, acquisition 79:10:32, control point number 2, acquisition 79:23:14. Over.
Roger. Copy. Ready for the TEI.
Okay, Bill. Before we read the big TEI update here, I'd like to give Jim briefly a procedure for P22. When he comes to NOUN 89, we request that he do a VERB 34 ENTER. Do not proceed, and by so doing then, he will not incorporate the lat and longitude from his mark, and he will not change the reference value of the landing site, and we will solve this AUTO OPTICS problem. Over.
Let me see if I have this correct, Mike. When flashing 0689 comes up with the latitude and longitude information, I will not proceed but will go to VERB 34 and terminate. Is that correct?
Yes, that is affirmative. Do a VERB 34 ENTER instead of a PROCEED. And that will -
Alright. Is this technique true -
Houston, is this technique true for both the node control point AUTO OPTICS on P25?
Stand by one, Jim.
And the LM ...
That is affirmative, Apollo 8. That is always true.
Okay. Roger. True for the code AUTO OPTICS and no landmark. I'll proceed instead of going on - or I'll use 34 instead proceeding on 89.
Roger. Thank you, Jim, and I have the TEI 6 hour when you are ready - or TEI number 6.
Go ahead.
Ready to copy.
Roger. I'm glad you are ready to copy TEI number 6. I've got one last comment for Jim before you do so. The VERB 89 - or correction - the NOUN 89 we are talking about is the one that he gets after marking. There are two NOUN 89's, one prior to marking and one after, and our procedure references NOUN 89 after marking. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Thank you, and, Bill, you still ready to copy?
Ready to copy, Mike.
TEI 6, SPS/G&N: 45701, minus 040, plus 157. Are you with me so far?
Roger.

Roger, Bill. On your ignition time, GETI is 81 hours, 081. Over.
Roger. Got it, 081.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Michael. As a matter of interest, these side windows are so hazy that when the sun shines on them, they just about - they are real poor for any visual observation or photography - heads-up.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. The last state vector updates we sent you, Jim, was to the LM slots, and you will have to transfer that over to the CSM slots using VERB 47 ENTER. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Bill has got his tape recorder back, and we noticed during that last dump, it was all in low bit rate. We wonder whether that was intentional or not? Over.
Roger. We didn't have much to say; we couldn't see out of the windows very well, Mike.
Roger. Understand.
It was really too bad.
Apollo 8, Houston. - -
Go ahead - -
Roger, Bill. This next time around into the sunlight, we do not expect any problem with the primary evaporator. If it does start drying out, we think it is best just to close the back pressure valve, and there is no need to activate the secondary boiler. Over.
Okay. I guess the 6O-degree limit will still hold then.
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are suggesting you disregard the 60 degree limit, and let it go ahead and rise up above 60. There is no need to activate the secondary. Over.
Okay. We just don't want to boil our IMU.
Roger. Understand then. Apollo 8, you are GO for the next lunar orbit REV.
Roger, Houston.
Roger, Houston. I'll read the book this time.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8 - -
Roger. We have about 4-1/2 minutes left before we have LOS; we'd like your last PRD readout. Over.
Stand by. The commander is asleep; we'll get his when he wakes up. The LMP is still 6 ... 0.64, C is 9, CMP is 0.09.
Roger. copy 0.64, 0.09. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. About 40 seconds to LOS, and everything's looking good down here.
Roger. Houston. We will give it another try here.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Reading you very weak but - a lot of background noise. Welcome back around. How are you reading us?
Reading you fine.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger, Houston. A few words on our optics tracking system. I used AUTO OPTICS for control points 1 and 2 on the backside, and they worked beautifully, tracked both the targets for me. And I went to the control point 3 as designated in our orbital control book to see the latitude and longitude that was given to me and used AUTO OPTICS to track that particular coordinate system, and it was very close to the actual tracking plot. I picked the mark there where I did a final marking and recorded latitude and longitude. I'm now about to come up on the landing site and using AUTO OPTICS in the coded input to see how that works.
Roger, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We know you're busy so we are not going to bother you. We are watching your progress on the DSKY. You are looking good; all your systems are looking good, and we have maneuver PAD's for you any time at your convenience.
Roger. We will take them when we are doing the P52, if that's okay.
That is just fine.
Mike, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, go ahead.
Mike, there are an awful lot of objects down on the landing site. It would just warm up Jack Schmidt's heart. The AUTO OPTICS are tracking perfectly on the target, and the two high peaks stand out beautifully. I have a beautiful view of it. The first I've seen just barely beneath the vertical now, and the second one coming up - It's just a grand view!
Roger, Jim. Glad to hear it. Jack's listening.
Jack, the information - The triangles that we see now are from the first IP, second IP, and the B-1 are just right, I think, for landing conditions. The shadows aren't too deep for you to get confused, but the land has texture to it, and there are enough shadows there to make everything stand out.
If Jack's listening, tell him that the optical may be doing all right, but the eyeball is having a little trouble looking through all this smear on the windows.
Roger. Understand the optics are doing better than the eyeballs. How about the cameras?
We always have the same smear to look through. The rendezvous windows are okay, but they're so small and looking in the wrong directions here so far.
Roger.
I think the vertical stereo will be okay.
It certainly looks like we're picking the more interesting places on the moon to land in. The backside looks like a sand pile my kids have been playing in for a long time. It's all beat up, no definition. Just a lot of bumps and holes.
I'm looking at 2P-2 right now, Houston, and it's a great spot.
The area we're over right now gives some hint of possible volcanic, though I really can't eyeball it at the moment to pin that down. There are some craters and buildups that just definitely suggest volcanic activity.
Roger. Understand, Bill, and understand Jim thinks the old 2P-2 is a winner.
Yes, that backside doesn't look good at all.
Roger.
That's relatively speaking, of course.
Of course.
Apollo 8, Houston.
This is Apollo 8.
Roger, Jim. We have you on the high-gain antenna. We'd like you to take the DSE and dump it over.
Roger, Houston. Are you going to use our computer to update our state vector?
That's affirmative, Jim. We'd like to - stand by one, and I'll tell you when to go to P00 and ACCEPT.
Roger. Then I'll work my 52 around your ...
Jim, would you please go to P00 in ACCEPT, and we'll send you a P27 and run a state vector update.
Roger. You have P00 in ACCEPT.
Thank you.
Houston, this is Apollo 8. We have a little piece of useful information if you're interested in deliberating over it.
Go ahead. Say again.
Roger. Our first control point is very near the terminator, and as the optics were tracking it, I had occasion to watch the sun come up. And at about 2 minutes before sunrise, you get - the limb begins to brighten up into sort of a fine white haze, a fine glow completely over the space just behind the limb.
Roger. I understand. About 2 minutes before the sun comes up, you get a fine white haze radiating out from behind the limb. How far out does it extend?
It goes up quite a ways. It takes a fan shape, unlike the sunrise on earth where the atmosphere affects it. This just sort of is a complete haze all over the local area. It's concentrated at the exact spot where the sun comes up at ignition and then goes away from the sun spots. Very interesting.
Thank you, Jim. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're standing by with your map and TEI 7 updates.
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. You can go back to BLOCK with your computer.
Roger.
Okay, Mike. We're ready for the map update and then the TEI.
Okay. When you get your - before you get your map book out, the Houston COMM TECHS have got a little word for an old ex-CAP COMM. They say they consider you in NONREMOTE. Over.
Not permanently, I hope.
Okay. Your map update for REV 6/7: LOS 80:57:24, sunrise 81:06:57, prime meridian 81:13:02. Are you with me?
You cut out after the prime meridian. I got it, but not AOS.
AOS 81:43:05, sunset 82:13:54. Remarks: IP-1 TCA for B-1 82:07:39, and now I've got four more times for you which - acquisition times for when various things come over the horizon. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. Control point 1, acquisition time 81:09:05; control point 2, acquisition time 81:21:48; control point 3, acquisition time 81:43:17. B-1 acquisition time 82:03:54. And I say again all those ACQ times are when they first come over the horizon. Over.
Roger. Copy, Houston. In about 2 seconds, I'll be ready for the TEI.
Alright.
I'm ready.
TEI 7, SPS/G&N - stand by one, Bill.
Just a matter of general interest, Houston: everybody is feeling good, and the CDR is taking a snooze.
Roger. Glad to hear it. We were just talking about a water dump down here. We've got one coming up, and it looks like on this REV prior to the time around LOS or just prior to LOS, would be a convenient time to do it. Do you concur?
Okay. We will. Down to 25 percent again?
That's affirmative, and we'd also be interested in any comments about what these various dumps have done to your optics, if anything, and how long the effects last after a dump.
Don't seem to have done anything to the optics, but they've definitely got in some of the windows. There are a few little chunks of ice on window number 1, which is nearest the vent, and also on window number 5 a little bit; windows 2 and 4 remain amazingly clear.
Roger. Thank you, Bill, and I'm ready to resume the PAD when you are.
Okay. Press on with the weight.
Alright. Weight 45701, minus 040, plus 157 083:18:20.80, plus 32346, minus 01168, plus 05730. Are you with me so far? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Mike.
Roger. I got down through ΔV|DELTA-V, minus X, minus Y, and minus Z. Did you copy those? Over.
No, I didn't read a word. I'm still waiting for the weight.
Roger. Let's go back to the weight: 45701, minus 040, plus 157. Are you with me? Over.
Sounds good.
Okay. GETI 083:18:20.80, plus 32346, minus 01168, plus 4 - correction, plus 05730. Are you with me? Over.
Roger.

Roger. TEI 7 SPS/G&N: 45701, minus 040, plus 157 083:18:20.80, plus 32346, minus 01168, plus 05730 179 9 - correction, 009 001, NA. Are you with me?
Yes, I'm with you, Bill.
Plus 00187 32870 307 32676 32 - correction, 420880 253033, down 121, left 27, plus 0790, minus 16500 12973 36238 146:44:14; same north set Sirius and Rigel, 129 155 010; four-jet, 15 seconds, 2 degrees, now horizon and peak.
That's all correct.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. You got your DSE back, and you are GO for the next lunar orbit. Over.
Roger. How far did you want us to dump that water?
Twenty-five percent, please, Bill.
Roger. Twenty-five percent.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Are you receiving our tracking data?
That's affirmative, Jim. We are receiving.
Okay. Thank you.
And also, Jim, we are - That last P27 we sent was for the LM state vector only, and it will require a VERB 47 ENTER to transfer to the CSM slot. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Thank you.
Okay. We're dumping the waste tank now, Houston.
Roger, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We've got 4 minutes til LOS, and everything is looking good down here.
Roger. How much longer do you think we have to go into battery charge there, Mike?
I'll find out for you.
If you can wake up the EECOM, why don't you have him ask the back room?
Oh, you really know how to hurt a guy.
Apollo 8, Houston. We estimate the charge will be complete in another 45 minutes. Over.
Okay. Thank you very much.
Apollo 8, Houston. One minute til LOS, and standing by.
Okay. See you on the other side, Mike.
Looking forward to it.
Me, too.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. Good morning. You're loud and clear, how me?
Loud and clear.
Welcome back.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We have a request that Jim space his marks, his five marks out a bit more slowly. If possible, we would like to get a couple of them past the zenith. We're getting five of them with rather rapid spacing, and from the geometry viewpoint, it would be better if you'd slow them down a little bit and lengthened them out so as to include a couple of them past the zenith. Over.
Roger. We understand.
Houston, Apollo 8. That last set of marks are invalid. Disregard what Jim drew the last time.
Roger. Understand the last set of marks are invalid. Over.
Roger. If you would correlate ... the last set.
We have an awful lot of background noise, Jim. Could you say again, please?
Roger. I'm coming up on control point 3. I tried to stick another control point in between 2 and 3. It didn't do it, so I just took out our program, marked it down on the program.
Roger. Understand you are coming up on 3.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. On Jim's marks, we'd like to get spacing of approximately 30, 30 seconds between each mark. The last ones we are copying roughly 15 seconds between marks, and we would like to stretch it out even further if that is okay with you.
Alright.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger, Mike. I find that tracking is much easier using the sextant than the scanning telescope. You have finer control, and at these orbital speeds, resolved to medium seem to be the best combination.
Roger, Jim. I copy that it's easier for you to use the sextant than the scanning telescope. It gives you finer control, and say again after that.
Apollo 8, Houston. Do you read?
Roger. Did you copy?
Roger. I copy that it's - tracking is easier using the sextant than the scanning telescope; it gives you finer control, and say again after that. Over.
And the combination of resolved and medium is perhaps the best combination of - combination of - speed low is too low; we can't catch up with the target.
Roger. Understand that the best combination is resolved and medium. Low is just too low.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. I'm not too sure what happened that time, Mike. I was marking on the landing sites, using the code, and I kept getting a large trunnion for AUTO OPTICS. And I could see the target, or landing site was coming up, so I just went manually and marked and got the - the latitude and longitude were quite different from the nominal.
Roger. We copy that, Jim.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We're checking into Jim's remarks on his P22; and in the meantime, I have your maneuver PAD's and map updates, at your convenience. Over.
Roger.
Go ahead with your data, Mike.
Okay. And before that, we'd like to take the DSE away from you, please, for a while.
All yours.
Thank you, and we'd like you to go to P00 and ACCEPT. We have a P27 state vector update for you.
There's P00, and I'm going to ACCEPT.
Thank you.
All yours.
Which would you like first, the map update or the TEI 8?
The map would be fine.
Okay. Map update: LOS 82:55:54, sunrise 83:05:49, prime meridian 83:11:38, AOS 83:41:43, sunset 84:18:45; remarks: control point 1 acquisition 83:07:39, control point 2 acquisition 83:20:21, control point 3 ACQ 83:41:51, B-1 acquisition 84:02:28. Over.
Roger. 82:55:54, 83:05:49, 83:11:38, 83:41:43, 84:18:45. CP-1 83:07:39, CP-2 83:20:21, CP-3 83:41:51, B-1 84:02:28.
That's affirmative.
Understand - -

Okay. Picking up with the boresight star, it's old Dzuba who is the center star in the head of Scorpio; he's down 060, left 42, plus 0773, minus 16500 12982 36256 146:46:18. North set stars remain Sirius, Rigel, roll 129, pitch 155, yaw 010; four-quad ullage of 15 seconds, horizon on a 4-degree line at TIG, and requesting you zero the optics. Over.
Roger. Going to ZERO OPTICS.
Are you through with the computer now, Mike?
It's your computer; P27 LM state vector in and verified.
Roger. We're going to put it in the CSM slot.
Roger. That's affirmative.
Okay. TEI 8, SPS/G&N: 45701, minus 040, plus 157 085:18:19.04, plus 33195, minus 01267, plus 04716 179 008 001, NA, plus 00187 33552 311 33355 42 09090 252, Dzuba down 060, left 4.2, plus 0773, minus 16500 12982 36256 146:46:18; Sirius, Rigel, 1.29 155 010, four-quad, 15 seconds, horizon 4 degrees at TIG.
You keep good books; that's all correct.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Some time back, we noted evidence of a restart in the computer and wondered if you had any remarks about it. Over.
I know it. Jim got screwed up on one of those programs. He's getting kind of tired here, and we got a RESTART and a couple of PROGRAM ALARMS. I don't know what he did.
Roger, Frank. The main point is the computer is looking fine to us, now.
That's good.
Houston, don't believe all you hear up here.
No, we have a filter, Jim, for that.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go.
Roger. In some of Jim's previous comments about the limb brightness as the sun was about to come up has sparked a lot of interest down here. And we'd like to ask him if he gets a chance to notice again or perhaps he can recall, whether there were any changes in the appearance of the stars. Such as, did he notice any twinkling while this was taking place, and did he notice any narrow limb brightening within 10 to 20 seconds prior to the sun's rising? Over.
He'll be with you - he's doing a P52 now.
Okay.
Houston, my comments concerning the sunrise was the comments above the terrain. There appeared what might be called diagonal light or light due to the haze or something like that. As the sun came above or before the sun came above the limb, definite rays could be seen coming from the other side. It was a uniform haze emanating from the center spot where the sun was going to rise, and this was something which I didn't expect.
Roger, Jim. Understand. We copied that and just curious, and if you see it again whether you notice any stars twinkling or any additional information.
Will do. Won't have a chance until control point 1.
Actually, he doesn't want to pass out too much of that information. He wants to save it and write a paper when he gets back, Mike.
Right. In German, probably, huh?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Okay. What time is that TV, Mike, 85:37?
85:37 to terminator, which is probably like 86:14.
Okay. Well, I don't know if we can go that long with it, and I'm going to scrub all the other experiments, the converging stereo or other photography, and we are a little bit tired; I want to use that last bit to really make sure we're right for TEI.
Roger, I understand, Frank.
A couple of miscellaneous items for you: we'd like for you to discontinue charging battery B at this time; we'd also like to get a cryo stir, 2 minutes on all four; and your UP TELEMETRY IU switch, put to BLOCK, please, and you are GO for the next lunar orbit.
Thank you.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead, Frank.
Roger. I want to scrub these control point sightings on this next REV, too, and let Jim take a rest.
Roger. I understand.
I understand you want to scrub control points 1, 2, and 3 on the next REV and the converging stereo on the following REV.
That's right. We're getting too tired.
Okay, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
This REV coming up we would like to clarify whether you intend to scrub control points 1, 2, and 3, only, and do the pseudo landing site; or whether you also intend to scrub the pseudo landing site marks. Over.
We're scrubbing everything. I'll stay up and try and keep the spacecraft vertical and take some automatic pictures, but I want Jim and Bill to get some rest.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Four minutes to LOS. You have control of the DSE now, and all your systems are looking good.
Thank you very much, Mike.
You bet.
Lovell is snoring already.
Yes, we can hear him down here.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
We have 1 minute to LOS, Frank. You can terminate stirring up your cryos any time, and we agree with all your flight plan changes. Have a beautiful backside, and we will see you next time out.
Thank you.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, loud and clear.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Apollo 8. Couple of notes for you: on the P52 you are coming up to on this REV, we've looked at your state vectors and all your information. The platform looks good, and it appears that it is your option if you would like to by-pass this P52, your platform will still be good at the following TEI pass. And we would like to have your PRD reading, and I guess we are behind the sleep summary. Over.
Okay. Jim and Bill are both resting now. I had about 3 or 4 hours earlier today.
Roger. COPY.
This PRD now reads 144.
Copy, 144. And we have an update ready to go into your computer for the state vector if you want to go to P00 and ACCEPT.
P00 and ACCEPT.
Thank you.
Jerry, I'm standing by to copy the TEI 9 PAD.
Okay, Apollo 8. We have completed with the computer. You can use the VERB 47 to transfer, and I have the TEI 9 PAD.
That's Ken isn't it? Just a minute, and I'll take care of it.
Roger.
Okay. I went to P00 and then VERB 47, and I'm ready to copy.
Okay. Do you have it in BLOCK?
Say again.
I say, do you have the UP TELEMETRY in BLOCK?
Roger.
Okay. This PAD is a TEI 9, SPS/G&N: 45597, minus 040, plus 157 087:19:18.20, plus 34188, minus 01353, plus 00780 180 008 001, November Alfa, plus 00187 34223 313 34021 42 0898 253 033, down 131, left 28, plus 0758, minus 16500 12987 36277 146:48:16; primary star Sirius, secondary Rigel, 129 155 010; four quads, 15 second, ullage, horizons on 1.2-degree window line at T minus 3; use high speed procedure with minus Mike Alfa. After looking at the burn information from your previous SPS burns, it appears that the engine performance should give us a 3-second burn time, longer than what you have on the PAD. The PAD number should correspond with what you get out of the computer. So we have not factored this into the past data; however, you can anticipate the engine for a normal ΔV|DELTA-V to give you a 3 second - 3.7-second burn in excess of the computed times. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
TEI 9, SPS/G&N: 45597, minus 040, plus 157 087:19:18.20, plus 34188, minus 01353, plus 00780 180 008 001, NA, plus 00187 34223 313 34021 42 0898 253 033, down 131, left 28, plus 0758, minus 16500 12987, plus - or 36277 146:48:16; and that's Sirius and Rigel 129 155 010, four jet, 15 seconds, 1.2 degrees on the window at T minus 3, high speed minus MA, engine 3.7 seconds longer than given.
That's affirmative, Apollo 8. And when you get around to it, if you would like for us to dump your tape, we can do that when you get on the high gain.
Roger.
Okay. Should have it on the high gain now, Houston.
Roger. And we're going to go ahead and dump the tape.
Roger.
Ken, will we get the real TEI PAD the next time around now?
Apollo 8, we'll have one for you the next time around, and we'll update it if necessary on the following REV.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Do you have any idea why quad B seems so much lower in quantity than the other three quads?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. It looks to us like, although we're reading out the same thing you are on the quad quantity, using the computer program and all of the correction factors that are in there, it looks like all four of your quads are very close. In pounds, it looks like you have, for example, 193 pounds in quad A and 189 in B, 200 in C, and 190 in Delta. And the difference that you read on the gage is attributed to the fact that you don't have all of the correction factors in there. This ground calculation has an accuracy of about plus or minus 6 percent, and the best you can do on board, even using your chart, is plus or minus 10 percent. Over.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. The tape recorder is back to you.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We've just finished looking at all your systems and all the trajectory information, and you have a GO for another REV.
Thank you.
I understand we're GO for REV 9.
That's affirmative, 8.
How's the weather down there, Ken?
It's really beautiful; loud and clear and just right in temperature.
How about the recovery area?
That's looking real good.
Very good.
Yes. They told us that there is a beautiful moon out there.
Now I was just saying that there's a beautiful earth out there.
It depends on your point of view.
Yes.
If you're looking for things to do up there, Frank, you might hit that BIOMED switch over to the left position.
Okay.
Are you ready?
All set.
Five, four, three - say again.
We've got the computers waiting.
Ken, are you ready? Five, four, three, two, one.
MARK.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
I'm reading you weak but clear, Frank.
How about this antenna? Is that any better?
It's a little louder.
Okay.
Hey, Ken; how did you pull duty on Christmas Eve? It happens to bachelors every time, doesn't it?
I wouldn't be anywhere else tonight.
Ken, how's the ... tracking on this lunar orbit coming out?
Okay. Frank, it's looking like it's coming right down the pike. It's doing just what it is supposed to, and apparently, all our computer programs have got the right numbers in them because they're predicting where you're going.
Have they covered any of these anomalies due to high spots?
Roger. They're detectable, but they're not changing, things enough to be anything more than - of interest.
Fine. Hope they are as good with the corridor as they were with the LOI. That was beautiful.
It sure was. That's - that is textbook all the way.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We're about - inside 10 minutes till LOS. We'll be picking you up again at 85:40, and we'll have all of the TV types' information standing by. In the event that the situation develops again, for pointing accuracies, if I see anything that looks like a terminator or anything of that nature, I'm going to call the dark side of it 12 o'clock, and use that as a reference system, and we'll try that. If that doesn't dope out any problems with camera pointing, why I may try - call for a plus pitch, and then I'll just correct what I see to account for it.
Roger. We're not going to use the telephoto lens. I don't believe we'll be able to get a picture of the earth. It's going to have to be the terminator, the lunar surface. I'm looking at the earth right now; and we won't see it again during that period.
Okay. Real fine then. And next time around, why, we'll take an extra special look at all of the parameters; we'll have our TEI PAD for you. And we'll use the last REV for a real good hack on all systems. I'll give you a rundown by system of all things we see and where they stand.
Okay. Fine.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're approaching 4 minutes to LOS. All systems are GO.
Roger. Thank you.
Houston.
Loud and clear and an initial look at your systems are good.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
We've got a picture, Apollo 8.
Roger. We've got the T - Roger. We've got the TV ...
How does the picture look, Houston?
Loud and clear.
The TV look okay?
That's very good.
Welcome from the moon, Houston.
Thank you.
Houston, you're seeing a view of the earth taken below the lunar horizon. We're going to follow a track until the terminator, where we will turn the spacecraft and give you a view of the long shadowed terrain at the terminator, which should come in quite well in the TV.
Roger.
We don't know whether you can see it from the TV screen, but the moon is nothing but a milky white - completely void. We're changing the cameras to the other window now.
This is Apollo 8, coming to you live from the moon. We've had to switch the TV cameras now. We showed you first a view of earth as we've been watching it for the past 16 hours. Now we're switching so that we can show you the moon that we've been flying over at 60 miles altitude for the last 16 hours. Bill Anders, Jim Lovell, and myself have spent the day before Christmas up here doing experiments, taking pictures, and firing our spacecraft engines to maneuver around. What we will do now is follow the trail that we've been following all day and take you on through to a lunar sunset. The moon is a different thing to each one of us. I think that each one of us - each one carries his own impression of what he's seen today. I know my own impression is that it's a vast, lonely, forbidding-type existence, or expanse of nothing, that looks rather like clouds and clouds of pumice stone, and it certainly would not appear to be a very inviting place to live or work. Jim, what have you thought most about?
Well, Frank, my thoughts are very similar. The vast loneliness up here of the moon is awe inspiring, and it makes you realize just what you have back there on earth. The earth from here is a grand oasis in the big vastness of space.
Bill, what do you think?
I think the thing that impressed me the most was the lunar sunrises and sunsets. These in particular bring out the stark nature of the terrain, and the long shadows really bring out the relief that is here and hard to see at this very bright surface that we're going over right now.
You're describe - that's not color, Bill. Describe some of the physical features of what you're showing the people.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're not receiving a picture now. Over.
We're now coming on to Smyth's Sea, a small mare region covered with a dark, level material. There is a fresh, bright, impact crater on the edge towards us and a mountain range on the other side. These mountains are the Pyrenees.
Apollo 8, we're not receiving modulation on the signal; we do have SYNC.
Are you reading us? Apollo, Houston.
Apollo 8, we're reading you loud and clear, but no picture. We have no modulation.
Roger. We understand. Take a look now.
How about now? Apollo.
Loud and clear. Good picture.
What you're seeing has been cross - Smyth's Sea are the craters Castner and Gilbert, and what we've noticed especially, that you cannot see from the earth, are the small bright impact craters that dominate the lunar surface.
The horizon here is very, very stark. The sky is pitch black, and the earth - or the moon, rather, excuse me - is quite light; and the contrast between the sky and the moon is a vivid, dark line. Coming into the view of the camera now are some interesting old double ring craters, some interesting features that are quite common in the mare region and have been filled by some material the same consistency of the maria and the same color. Here are three or four of these interesting features. Further on the horizon you see the ... The mountains coming up now are heavily impacted with numerous craters whose central peaks you can see in many of the larger ones.
Actually, I think the best way to describe this area is a vastness of black and white, absolutely no color.
The sky up here is also rather forbidding, foreboding expanse of blackness, with no stars visible when we're flying over the moon in daylight.
You can see by the numerous craters that this planet has been bombarded through the eons with numerous small asteroids and meteoroids pockmarking the surface every square inch.
And one of the amazing features of the surface is the roundness that most of the craters - seems that most of them have a round mound type of appearance instead of sharp, jagged rocks.
Only the newest feature is of any sharp definition to them, and eventually they get eroded down by the constant bombardment of small meteorites.
How is the picture now, Houston? Houston, are you reading us?
Loud and clear, and the picture looks real fine.
Thank you.
Can you see the two large craters just to the right of our track, Houston?
That's affirmative.
The very bright features you see are the new impact craters, and the longer a crater has been on the surface of the moon, why, the more mottled and subdued it becomes. Some of the - -
Apollo 8, we've apparently lost your voice; the picture is still good.
Roger.
Houston, we're passing over an area that's just east of the Smyth's Sea now, in checking our charts. Smyth's Sea is coming up in a few minutes.
Roger.
Apollo 8, if you go to P00 and ACCEPT, we'll uplink some information.
We are now coming up towards the terminator, and I hope soon that we'll be able to show you the varying contrast of white as we go into the darkness. Houston, we're in P00, and you have the computer.
Thank you.
We're now approaching a series of small impact craters. There is a dark area between us and them which could possibly be an old lava flow.
You can see the large mountains on the horizon now ahead of the spacecraft to the north of our track.
The intensity of the sun's reflection in this area makes it difficult for us to distinguish the features we see on the surface, and I suppose it's even harder on the television, but as we approach the terminator and the shadows become longer, you'll see a marked change.
There is a very dark crater in the filling material in this valley in front of us now. It is rather unusual in that it is sharply defined, yet it's dark all over its interior walls, whereas most new-looking craters are of very bright interior.
Small impact crater in front of us now in the little mare well defined, quite new, and another one approaching. The spacecraft is facing North. From our track, we are going sideways to our left.
You are now seeing the Sea of Crises coming over the horizon.
We believe the crater, the large dark crater between the spacecraft and the Sea of Crises is Condorcet Crater. The Sea of Crises is amazingly smooth as far as the horizon and past this rather rough mountainous region in front of the spacecraft.
Apollo 8, we are through with the computer. You can go back to BLOCK, and it looks like we are getting a lot of reflection off your window now.
Roger. We'll switch windows; How does that look now, Ken?
That's real fine.
Apollo 8, can you tell us which window you are looking out? And there is a large crater, looks like it is sticking up in the upper right hand corner of our picture. Can you identify that one?
Roger. We are just about to lose our lock; that is why we are slowing up a little bit. We see the Sea of Crises in front of us now. We are looking out the left hand rendezvous window.
Houston, how are you reading us now?
Loud and clear.
The crater you see on the horizon is the Sea of Crises. How are you reading us, Houston?
Loud and clear, Apollo 8, and we have a picture that is good.
Right.
Roger. We are getting a lot of static. The Sea of Crises is in front of us on the horizon, and the dark crater Picard can be seen in the middle. We are now breaking the moon's sunrise or the spacecraft's sunset. This is an area that the sun has just recently come up on the moon. The mare we are over now has a mottled look about it, but not very heavily cratered, so it must be relatively new. This is the Sea of Fertility, and we're coming upon a large crater, the delta rim variety; has a strange circular cracked pattern around the middle of it. The crater that you see now is about 30 or 40 miles across.
How is your picture quality, Houston?
This is phenomenal.
There is an interesting rill directly in front of the spacecraft now, running along the edge of a small mountain; rather sinuous shape with right-angle turns.
This area just to the west of the Sea of Crises is called the Marsh of Sleep and to the west of that the Sea of Tranquility.
Can you see the fracture patterns going across the mare in front of us now, Houston?
That doesn't quite stand out.
Roger. The series of cracks or faults across the middle of the mare: they drop down in about three steps to the south. The parallel fault pattern to the north has a drop down in the center. I hope all of you back down on earth can see what we mean when we say that it is a rather foreboding horizon, a very rather dark and unappetizing looking place. We are now going over - approaching one of our future landing sites selected in this smooth region to - called the Sea of Tranquility - smooth in order to make it easy for the initial landing attempts in order to preclude the having to dodge mountains. Now you can see the long shadows of the lunar sunrise. We are now approaching the lunar sunrise, and for all the people back on earth, the crew of Apollo 8 has a message that we would like to send to you.
In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth.  And the Earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters, and God said, "let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light and that it was good, and God divided the light from the darkness.
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.  And God said, "let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters. And let it divide the waters from the waters."  And God made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
And God said, "let the waters under the Heavens be gathered together into one place. And let the dry land appear." And it was so. And God called the dry land Earth. And the gathering together of the waters called the seas. And God saw that it was good. And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you - all of you on the good Earth.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Loud and clear, Apollo 8. And thank you for a very good show. We have a maneuver PAD for you when you are ready to copy.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, read you loud and clear.
Roger. Are we off the air now?
That's affirmative, Apollo 8. You are.
Did you read everything that we had to say there?
Loud and clear. Thank you for a real good show.
Okay. Now, Ken, we'd like to get all squared away for TEI here. Can you give us some good words like you promised?
Yes, sir. I have a maneuver PAD. I think we would like to start by dumping the tape. If we can have that, I have your TEI 10 maneuver PAD, and then we will run through a systems brief.
I understand this is a maneuver PAD that we will use for TEI. Is that correct?
And you got the tape, Houston.
Thank you.
Ready to copy, Ken.
Roger. TEI 10, SPS/G&N: 45597, minus 040, plus 157 089:19:15.64, plus 35189, minus 01513, minus 00346 180 007 000, November Alfa plus 00186 35223 318 35019 42 0928 253, boresight star Scorpii Delta (another name for it is Dzuba) down 071, left 45, plus 0748 minus 16500 12995 36300 146:50:05; primary star Sirius, secondary, Rigel, 129 155 010; four quads, 15 second, ullage; horizon on the 2.9 window line at T minus 3; use high-speed procedure with minus Mike Alfa. Over.
Okay. TEI PAD as follows: SPS/G&N: 45597, minus 040, plus 157 089:19:15.64, plus 35189, minus 01513, minus 00346 180 007 000, not applicable, plus 00186 35223 318 35019 42 0928 253, Scorpii Delta (Dzuba), down 071, left 45, plus 0748 minus 16500 12995 36300 146:50:05; Sirius, Rigel, 129 155 010; four quads, 15 seconds, 2.9-degree window line at TIG minus 3, high-speed procedure minus MA.
That's correct, Apollo 8.
Ken, this is Frank. I want to - - I want to make one thing certain. This the load that we are to use to burn with, right? This is not just a PAD data for 10 abort?
Okay, Apollo 8. We will update this PAD prior to the burn.
Oh, you will? Okay.
Yes, sir.
Say again.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. I am reading you with a lot of background noise. Can you read me clearly?
Roger.
Okay. I am going to give you a quick summary of systems. Basically, all systems are good. In respect to your return trajectory, we can still get to the mid-Pacific line at 146 hours by waiting as late as the thirteenth REV. After 138 seconds of the burn, you are on your way home. The weather in the recovery area looks good. Apollo 8, did you call?
Continue, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Could we have the high gain for a little bit longer?
We broke scan on it, Ken.
Okay. You are coming in loud and clear now. Did you copy my trajectory information?
We are on OMNI B now.
Roger. That is fine.
Say again, please. Go ahead. We are 130 - Will you say again, please?
Wilco, Apollo 8. First, if you can spare, we would like to have the high gain to complete the dump.
Stand by. We will try to get it for you.
Roger.
In a couple of minutes there, Houston.
Roger. Thank you.
Okay, Apollo 8. While we are - -
Apollo 8, while we are waiting for the high gain, I will continue the trajectory summary. We can still get back to the mid-Pacific line in 146 hours from the thirteenth REV, and you are on your way after 138 seconds of the burn. That's 138 seconds, gets you clear of the butterfly region. We recommend not trying preignitions or restarts after 20 seconds. If you go beyond 20 seconds, this may get the trajectory beyond the correction - RCS correction capability to a free return. The weather in recovery area is good. We have an AOS following TEI of 89 plus 28 plus 39 and an AOS without TEI of 89 plus 37 plus 24. During the burn, you may notice a slight change in chamber pressure and tank pressures due to the fuel exhaustion in the storage tank and going to the sump tank. This may occur somewhere around 2 to 5 seconds into the burn. It'll be a small change in pressures in both systems. Going down the systems, all systems are GO. In ECS, we want to stop water boiling after TEI for trajectory purposes. Your water dump situation looks good; you should be good to greater than 105 hours. We'll try to hold off the water dump until after MCC 5. In the EPS, we'd like to stir the cryos prior to TLI - correction TEI. The next purge on the fuel cells will occur at approximately 92 hours, and that will be both hydrogen and oxygen. Your battery status: battery A 34.9, battery B 39.1, and Charlie 38.5. We have the single tank cryo capability. SPS: looking at the performance on the previous burns, you can anticipate a normal burn taking approximately 3.7 seconds in excess of the computed values. Engine performance looks nominal, and all parameters have been steady. RCS looks good; all four quads according to the computer programs have approximately the same capacity. You have a good REFSMMAT to take you through TEI. We'll have a post TEI PTC attitude for you in a few minutes. and that just about wraps up what we have on systems. Over.
Roger. Thank you, Houston. We appreciate the summary. We're trying to get high gain.
Roger.
I think we have it.
You do have the high gain. Now, Ken, as I understand it, if it shuts down after 20 seconds of burn, you don't want us to try to re-light it. Is that what you said?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, the intent was do not delay ignitions beyond 20 seconds. Over.
Oh, do not delay ignition beyond 20 seconds Roger.
That's affirm.
Okay. You want me to start it on tank A and then switch to B again like we did on our LOI, right?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Did you put in this PAD for us? Should P30 and 40 be in our computer now?
Apollo 8, that's negative. We had not uplinked this PAD. We'll put this one in on the next pass.
Okay. Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. You have a GO for this REV.
Roger, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have completed the tape dump, and the recorder is yours.
Thank you.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8 on OMNI C.
Loud and clear.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're 5 minutes to LOS; we'll have AOS Honeysuckle at 87:38:42.
Roger.
Apollo 8, everything looks good going over the hill.
Roger, Ken. Thanks a lot. We'll see you around the next pass. Just have our TEI update for us when you're ready. Okay?
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
Okay. You want the computer?
Apollo 8, we would like to have the high gain, and when we get that, well, we will start a dump, and we will start your updates.
Okay. How about reading us the PAD, and we will try to get you the high gain.
Ken, read us off the PAD in case you can't get the dump in; we can still do it.
Roger. I have got them right here.
Okay, Apollo 8. The first PAD I have is TEI 10.
Go ahead.
Alright. TEI 10, SPS/G&N: 45597, minus 040, plus 157 089:19:15.67, plus 35186, minus 01512, minus 00520 180 007 000, November Alfa, plus 00186 35223 318 35018 42 0924 253; Scorpii Delta, down 069, left 45, plus 0748, minus 16500 12994 36300 146:50:05; primary star Sirius, secondary Rigel, 129 155 010; four quads, 15 seconds, ullage; horizon on 3.2-degree window line at T minus 3; use high-speed procedure with minus Mike Alfa. Over.
Stand by 1 second.
You got the high gain now, Ken.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Loud and clear.
Apollo 8, we would like to - -
- - TEI 10.
Apollo 8, we would like to have you go to P00 and ACCEPT and we would like to take the recorder at this time; then I will copy your PAD.
You have got P00 and ACCEPT, and you have the recorder.
Thank you, Jim.
All set for the maneuver.
Go ahead.
TEI 10, SPS/G&N: 45597, minus 040, plus 157 089:19:15.67, plus 35186, minus 01512, minus 00520 180 007 000, not applicable, plus 00186 35223 318 35018 42 0924 253; Scorpii Delta, down 069, left 45, plus 0748, minus 16500 12994 36300 146:50:05; Sirius, Rigel, 129 155 010; four-quad, ullage, 15 seconds; horizon on the 3.2-degree mark is T minus 3; high-speed procedure minus MA.
That is correct, Apollo 8. Would like to confirm the hours on GETI, 089.
Roger. 089.
Alright, Apollo 8. I have TEI 11 PAD;
We are ready; go ahead.
Roger. TEI 11, SPS/G&N: 45597, 0 - correction - that's minus 040, plus 157 091:18:12.24, plus 36325, minus 01727, plus 01428 180 003 000, November Alfa, plus 00186 36394 323 36186 42 0995 254; Scorpii Delta, down 103, left 48, plus 0742, minus 16500 13005 36327 146:51:44; Sirius and Rigel, 129 155 010, four quads, 15 seconds; horizon on 2.9-degree line at T minus 2; high-speed procedure with minus Mike Alfa. Over.
Roger, Houston. TEI minus 11, SPS/G&N: 45597, minus 040, plus 157 091:18:12.24, plus 36325, minus 01727, plus 01428 180 003 000, not applicable, plus 00186 36394 323 36186 42 0995 254; Scorpii Delta, down 103, left 48, plus 0742, minus 16500 13005 36327 146:51:44; Sirius, Rigel, 129 155 010; four quads, 15 seconds, 2.9-degree window mark at T minus 2; high-speed procedure minus MA.
That's correct, Apollo 8.
Houston, could you give me the SPS helium tank temperature at about 87:20, please?
Okay. Stand by one.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Our loads are in and verified; the computer is yours.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. At 87:48, we're reading 84 degrees, and at LOS we had 80. We'll take a look at the tape and see if we can find out what we had on the backside.
Okay. I would kind of like to know what I might expect at ignition here at TEI.
Roger. We'll take that off the tape.
Houston; this is 8. I take it you have loaded both state vectors; is that correct?
That's affirmative.
Roger.
We loaded your CSM and LM NAV and external ΔV|DELTA-V, in that order.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay, Apollo 8. We've reviewed all your systems. You have a GO for TEI. One of the things we would like to do as soon as you come out on the other side is a P23. We are checking into your helium pressures now. We're going to correlate not only the last REV but the previous REV for the same location, and we will have that number for you in a little bit.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. The tape recorder is yours. I have your PTC attitude.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay. PTC attitude will be pitch 10, yaw 45. This begins at 92 hours. Over.
Is that pitch 10 and yaw 45?
Affirmative. And looks like that will go with the entry REFSMMAT; begins at 92 hours.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, would you put your UP TELEMETRY to BLOCK, please?
In BLOCK.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. On the helium tank TEMP's: that's not recorded on low bit rate, and looking over our tape dumps, most of this stuff we have on the backside there is low bit rate. So we won't be able to give you an exact number, but looking at what we have every time we go out of sight and come back over the hill, it looks like you can expect about 82 to 84 degrees as a nominal temperature.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to have the tape recorder for about 5 minutes for one last look.
Roger, Houston. You're getting it.
Thank you. And I guess we still have a cryo stir ahead of us, and we've checked your triple bias, and there's no change.
Roger. And we're stirring cryos right now.
Thank you.
Ken, are you through with the tape recorder?
Stand by one.
We're on a maneuver to burn attitude, and it's going to make us lose the high gain.
Apollo 8, the tape recorder is yours. We have your double umbra update, 89:07:15.87.
Roger. Copy.
Roger. And no change on your AOS time.
Say that again, will you, Ken?
There's no change on your AOS time.
Now what was it?
Okay. With TEI, 89:28:39.
Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have 3 minutes to LOS; all systems are GO.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, this is Houston. Three minutes LOS; all systems are GO. Over.
Roger. Thank you, Houston. Apollo 8.
All systems are GO. Apollo 8.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Hello, Apollo 8. Loud and clear.
Roger. Please be informed there is a Santa Claus.
That's affirmative. You are the best ones to know.
That burn status report: it burned on time; burn time 2 minutes 23 seconds, seven-tenths VG<sub>X</sub>. Attitude nominal, residuals minus five-tenths VG<sub>X</sub> plus four-tenths VG<sub>X</sub> - of minus O VG<sub>Z</sub>. ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> minus 26.4.
Roger.
Apollo FLIGHT has -
Apollo 8, reconfirm your burn time, please.
Roger. We had 2 minutes 23 seconds. Our - wait one. Change that to read 3 minutes 23 seconds.
Thank you.
This gives the sensation that you are climbing, Ken.
Say again, Apollo 8.
I say that this gives the sensation that you are climbing.
Roger.
What's next on the docket?
High-gain antenna.
Apollo 8, at the first convenient moment, we'd like to have the high-gain antenna.
You've got it; you're on the high gain.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We do not have any data on the ground yet; the voice is very good.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to try to have you manually acquire on the high gain.
Okay.
This will take a wide beam width.
Wide beam width. Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. We've manually acquired in wide beam.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear. Initial tracking indicates a 4 foot per second at 8 hours will put you on target.
Four foot per second at 8 hours.
Correction, that's 15 hours.
Roger. Roger.
Apollo 8, we have data; we'd like to have the tape recorder.
You can have it.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Roger. Do you wish me to reinitialize the W-matrix at this time?
Affirmative, Apollo 8.
Roger. And that - -
Houston, Apollo 8. Which battery do you want us to start charging?
Okay. We'd like to start on battery Alfa.
Battery Alfa. Okay.
Apollo 8, would you go to NARROW BEAM on the high gain?
Just a minute.
We're on NARROW BEAM.
Roger. Sounds real good now.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. If you'll go to P00 and ACCEPT, we'll update the REFSMMAT, and I have some backup GDC angles for the new entry REFSMMAT.
Roger. Understand; P00 and ACCEPT, and you'll give us the new REFSMMAT.
Affirm.
Okay. Houston, you have the ACCEPT.
Roger. Your backup GDC alignment: roll 308, pitch 209, yaw 357. Over.
Roger. Alright. What set of stars?
That's on Sirius and Rigel.
Understand; roll 308, pitch 209, yaw 357.
That's affirmative, Apollo 8.
Good morning, Apollo 8; Deke here. I just would like to wish you all a very Merry Christmas on behalf of everyone in the Control Center, and I'm sure everyone around the world. None of us ever expected to have a better Christmas present than this one. Hope you get a good night's sleep from here on and enjoy your Christmas dinner tomorrow; and look forward to seeing you in Hawaii on the twenty-eighth.
Okay, leader. We'll see you there. That was a very, very nice ride, that last one; this engine is the smoothest one.
Yes, we gathered that; an outstanding job all the way around.
Thank everybody on the ground for us. It's pretty clear we wouldn't be anywhere if we didn't have them doing it or helping us out here.
We concur that.
I concur, too.
Even Mr. Kraft does something right once in a while.
He got tired of waiting for you to talk and went home.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. The computer is yours, and I guess we have an IMU alignment and a P23 on the schedule.
Okay. Thank you. Do an IMU alignment coming up. See them in black.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We would like to have you cycle your ZERO OPTICS switch prior to beginning P52.
Roger. We are going to see if we can find some stars here before we do this P52.
Roger. And got a couple of words for you. Jack's been watching you since LOI, and he has a few words he wants to give you.
Go ahead.
Typhoid Jack here, and we have got some good words here that originated at the Cape with a bunch of friends of yours. And it's sort of in a paraphrase of a poem that you probably are familiar with. Do you read me, Apollo 8?
You are loud and clear, Jack.
Okay.<br><br> "'Twas the night before Christmas and way out in space,<br> the Apollo 8 crew had just won the moon race;<br> The headsets were hung by the consoles with care,<br> In hopes that Chris Kraft soon would be there;<br> Frank Borman was nestled all snug in his bed,<br> While visions of REFSMMAT's danced in his head;<br> And Jim Lovell, in his couch, and Anders, in the bay,<br> were racking their brains over a computer display,<br> When out of the DSKY, there arose such a clatter,<br> Frank sprang from his bed to see what was the matter.<br> Away to the sextant he flew like a flash,<br> To make sure they weren't going to crash.<br> The light on the breast of the moon's jagged crust,<br> Gave a luster of green cheese to the gray lunar dust,<br> When what to his wondering eyes should appear,<br> But a Burma Shave sign saying 'Kilroy was here.'<br> <br> (Laughter)<br> <br> But Frank was no fool; he knew pretty quick,<br> That they had been first; this must be a trick.<br> More rapid than rockets, his curses they came,<br> He turned to his crewmen and called them a name.<br> Now Lovell, now Anders, now don't think I'd fall<br> For an old joke you've written up on the wall.<br> They spoke not a word, but grinning like elves,<br> And laughed at their joke in spite of themselves.<br> Frank sprang to his couch, to the ship gave a thrust,<br> And away they all flew past the gray lunar dust.<br> But we heard them explain ere they flew around the moon:<br> Merry Christmas to earth; we will be back there real soon."<br> <br> Great job, gang.
Thank you very much. That was a very good poem; but in order to win the race, you have got to end up on the carriers.
We will see you there.
Hey, Jack. You really got Bill trained. (Laughter)
Okay.
I certainly hope so.
You did pretty well, Jim.
You must have talked on the way out there. (Laughter)
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Roger. We got an alignment with your new REFSMMAT now. What's on the program here? You want us in P23 and then what?
Looks like some sleep is coming up.
That's what I wanted you to say. We used up the gimbal angles of 10 and 45 with the - this REFSMMAT, right?
Affirmative.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Notice that you are starting on your P23 which is the last scheduled activity. Initial tracking looks like the initial midcourse may be less than the 4 foot per second on the first guess. And we have looked at your burn data, and it's all just as smooth as you said; everything on there looked real nominal. Systems now look good; looks like in PTC attitude, we should be able to switch OMNI's for you, if you would like to do that. We were having good success with predicting on the way out where to switch the antennas, and if it will help you any, we can do that on the way back in.
That would be nice if you could do it, but we will keep one man in the shop to watch the gimbal angles; but if you could switch the OMNI's, it would sure save us a lot of problems.
Okay. We will do that. When you get in the PTC attitude, we will let you know when we take the command on the antenna switching.
Okay. Just be careful what you do with the tape recorder. Bill's a little sensitive about that.
Roger. We were listening to the tape dumps, and it looks like Bill gets a happy new year after all.
A happy new year? How come, Jack - an, in a joke?
No, we got that off of his tape dump; he and Jim were discussing that one.
Oh, yes. That's right.
Houston, are you getting all this data from P23?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
I wanted to know if you're getting the data from P23?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Eureka!
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Ken, we've about run out of gas here on this next set of stars. Would you ask your people to be especially alert there watching the systems tonight?
Sure will, Frank.
Okay. It's maneuver to pitch 10 and yaw 45.
Roger. I have - let's see, we've got a hydrogen purge line here that ought to come on about 91:40 and an oxygen-hydrogen fuel cell purge for 92 hours.
Okay. Will you call us about those, please?
I sure will. And, let's see, we just wanted to let you know we've got a real good battery charge going here this time. Looks like - it looks just like the ones in the book, and I'd like to get a battery C voltage before you shut down, and a sleep report on what you did in - -
Okay.
- - lunar orbit and your plans for the next couple of hours.
Okay.
Thirty-seven volts on battery C.
Roger. Thirty-seven volts.
That looks good.
We all only got about 2 hours sleep today MAX, Ken. We're going now - Bill's going to stay up awhile, and Jim and I are going to sack out, and we're going to try to rotate short sleep cycles till we can get back to the normal one.
Roger, sounds like a good idea. And EECOM on the ground tells us that the flying EECOM is to go ahead and put his hydrogen purge line heater on, and we'll get ready for a fuel cell.
Thank you. He can't turn on his radio. There he goes.
I hope it won't disappoint anybody too much if we knock off those last two stars, but Jim is just in a daze, and so am I.
Roger. No sweat.
Thank you.
Apollo 8. One of the things we'd like to have before you shut down also is VERB 64 so we can watch the pointing angles.
Roger.
Hey, Frank, you might be interested; they are having some trouble with the medics' P-2.
What?
The medics can't clean out their P-2.
Oh, is that right? It's been so busy.
Oh, yeah. It's worn the thing out at the bearings. (Laughter)
Hey, Ken, tell the people if you see anything getting close to the gimbal lock to be sure and whistle, too, will you?
We sure will, Frank. You will want to make sure one of you keeps your COMM carrier on.
We'll keep one man with a headset on.
That's right. We'll keep one man with a COMM carrier on.
Apollo 8. You have got some big yaw angle there.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Copy that you are now in PTC attitude, and we're watching your gimbal angle. We apparently do not have a downlink voice, but the data is good.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Loud and clear, 8.
Okay. We're establishing PTC. We took one last look at the moon and on our way back.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. In order for us to handle the antenna switching, I guess we'd like to have the AUX tape switched to OFF, and the tape FORWARD switch OFF; and we'll be switching between OMNI's Bravo and Delta.
Between what and what?
Okay. We are going to be switching between OMNI's Bravo and Delta.
Okay.
Alright. And I'm gonna - you bug me when you get over 50 degrees of yaw, so I'll probably be watching that number pretty closely. We'd like to have the BIOMED switched to the right position. Okay. And for your own information: the fuel we show in the different quads I have here if you would like to copy it.
Stand by.
Okay. Ready to copy.
Okay. I'll give you the percentage on Alfa 60, Bravo 57, Charlie ...
Wait a minute. It asks for present time, and I can't plot that fast, Ken.
Okay. I'm sorry. Alfa is 60.
For what time?
91:36.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. What's Bravo?
Okay. That's 57.
Okay.
Charlie 62.
Okay.
And Delta 57.33842.
That's a coincidence. That's just what I worked out on Lovell's slide rule.
How are we doing on the cryos?
Oh, you've got some pretty good numbers on that that I sent up yesterday, and you had about 160 hours. Well, I'll check that out, but you were fat on cryo. I've got some SPS ΔV|DELTA-V. You've got 33:20. You fly the service module RCS through the DAP. You have 142; and through SCS, it's 121.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We can't monitor on low bit rate whether you started your fuel cell purge. If you haven't, we can still go ahead and start now; and if you can, keep us posted as you go through it.
Roger. You want an O<sub>2</sub> and an H<sub>2</sub> purge, Ken?
That's affirmative.
You shall have it.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston - -
Go ahead.
It looks like you may be in OMNI Alfa. Can you confirm that we're set up to switch between Bravo and Delta?
You are now.
Okay. Thank you very much. And you are in the fuel cell purge?
It's complete.
Okay. Understand the purge is complete. Thank you. And in reference to your cryo, it looks like we'll have 180 pounds in each oxygen tank at SEP and 11 pounds in each hydrogen tank. And you're well above the single tank capability.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston in the blind. Select OMNI Charlie. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Apollo 8, Houston in the blind. We've lost all data on you and request you select us a good OMNI antenna; try Charlie. Over.

I read you loud and clear; my COMM here must have come unconnected.
Roger, Bill. We lost data on you for 15 minutes and voice COMM for about 45 and were beginning to get a little itchy. Is your PTC set up for rate command attitude hold?
Roger. Pitch and roll is in PTC.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Set up OMNI Charlie. Over.
Roger. OMNI Charlie.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing yaw 54.5. Over.
Roger. It's been deadband right around there the whole time.
You can take command P00, also, if you want to. You might have to use it again.
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
You can take over command P00; you might have to use it again.
Roger, Bill.
I'm trying to be quiet so the other guys can sleep, Jerry.
Roger, Bill.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
Go ahead.
Switch to OMNI Bravo, and we'll try the Bravo-Delta switching again. Over.
You got it.
You blew it.
We're on OMNI E now, Houston.
Roger, Bill.
Looks like B couldn't quite hack it; I'll put it back there in a minute.
Roger.
Houston, if your EECOM's need any more help, just tell them to give me a call.
Roger.
We're going on OMNI Bravo now, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
OMNI Bravo.
Roger. OMNI Bravo.
Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like we're getting pretty far off in both pitch and yaw. Showing about 50 degrees in pitch; and about 25 in yaw.
Roger. I get that.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. All systems looking good. Over.
Apollo 8. Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Your systems are all looking good. Got a flight plan update for you: at time 96, you can delete P52. Your drift rates are real small.
Roger. And I'd like to do the chlorination at about 95:30 if I could.
Roger. Understand; chlorination: 95:30. Okay?
Houston, we're on OMNI C and going to Bravo now - correction, Dog.
Roger. Understand; going Delta.
We're on Charlie now.
Roger. Understand you're on Charlie. Break. Verify your UP TLM switch at COMMAND RESET is at NORMAL. Over.
Roger. It's in NORMAL. I've had the COMMAND RESET since we broke lock there, and I have to get back and control the OMNI's, so why don't you go command it over to Dog. Then give it back, and I'll set the other one on Bravo.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have you on Delta; you can go to Bravo. Break. Give us a call when you've finished your chlorination. Over.
Okay. Everybody seems to be stirring around now, so we'll probably do it on time.
Okay.
Houston, and the other two space aces are up now, and LMP's going to hit the pad and like to take a Seconal prior.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Permission granted, Bill. Have a good sleep.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like you need about 3 more hours on that battery A charging. Over.
Okay. Well, my cohorts can handle it.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Can we get a crew status report on Bill before he goes to sleep?
He's feeling fine; a little sleepy.
Roger.
And had a meal about - had a meal about 2 hours ago; drinking lots of water.
Roger, Bill. Thanks.
Okay.
Good night.
Good night. Wish everybody a Merry Christmas for me.
Sure will, Bill. Same to you.
Thanks.
Make sure Bill hangs up his stocking before he goes to bed.
I've got it right next to my teddy bear.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We're up on all the jobs; Bill's going to sleep; he's already down.
Roger, Frank. Good morning.
Good morning.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. I have a little feature news and sports news for you if you'd like to hear it.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. I have some feature page and sports page news if you'd like it.
Roger.
Roger. First of all, Frank, the guys down here on the consoles want to spread their appreciation for a beautiful television job done.
Thank you.
Roger. We'll start out with the sports news. Los Angeles Dodger pitcher, Sandy Koufax, and Ann Widmark, 23-year-old daughter of actor Richard Widmark, plan to marry some time in the near future. Koufax said Tuesday that no date for the wedding was set, but he and Miss Widmark have been dating for some time. At Springfield, - -
...
Say again.
Morning. How do you read?
Good morning, Jim.
Let's see. In Springfield, Missouri, Mickey Owen, the old-time catcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers who made the record books by dropping a third strike that led the New York Yankees to a victory over the Dodgers in the '41 World Series, decided that he would be remembered by more than just his sports record. Forty-five boys and girls have been the recipients of ponies that he offered. These youngsters were requested to send letters in telling him how they would care for a pony. When the letters poured in, he added five ponies to the 20 he already offered; and other donors pitched in 20 more. And said Mickey Owen, "I thought I'd have about 45 letters, but I ended up with about 900." Now on the feature page: Wellington, New Zealand, about fifty men sat down to the traditional turkey and cranberry sauce at the South Pole today, but the Christmas had an Oriental flavor, as well. It included Sukiyaki cooked by members of a Japanese party who are crossing the Antarctic continent and stopped for the day with the U.S. Navy Polar base. In San Diego, California, the crewmen of the captured intelligence ship Pueblo donated their first paychecks to the workers at San Diego's Balboa Naval Hospital. They had all been given twenty dollars each, and - when they landed in San Diego - and they felt that this was a good demonstration of their feelings for those who had done so much to make their welcome here.
Apollo 8, Houston. We read your antenna change. Are you still reading us?
Roger. This is Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger.
We just now changed antennas, or you must have.
Okay.
You lost ...
In Reno, Nevada. Oh, that's affirmative, Frank. We changed the antennas from here.
Thank you.
In Reno, Nevada, because there is no fireplace in his home, ... a little boy wrote Santa Claus in care of the local newspaper and suggested, "would you please use the front door. You will have to kick the bottom a little bit because it sticks." In Little Rock, Arkansas, babies born at St. Vincent Infirmary during the week before Christmas and through Christmas Day are being released to their mothers at discharge time in huge red Christmas stockings. Here is one in ecumenical cooperation. In Indio, California, the Chief of Police was armed Christmas Day with a prayer book. Rabbi Phillip H. Weinburg has taken over as Chief for a day so the real Police Chief, Homer Hunt, a Methodist could spend the holiday with his family. This is the third straight Christmas the Rabbi has filled in for Hunt. The previous 6 years, Rabbi Weinburg did the same for the Roman Catholic Police Chief of Reno, Nevada.
Prom the Associated Press, Americans watch Pope Paul celebrate Christmas Mass in Italy, and Europeans viewed a Christmas greeting from Apollo 8 via the most powerful communications satellite yet sent aloft. The news of Pope Paul and the Apollo 8 crew Tuesday night were the first to be relayed across the Atlantic commercially by Intelsat III, which was launched from Cape Kennedy last Wednesday. That's the one we saw go.
Roger. I remember that.
Intelsat is a 63-nation international communication consortium; provides a chart on the first global communications network. The new satellite is scheduled to begin full commercial service on January 2, initially serving North and South America and Europe. Further coverage of the Apollo 8 mission is to be relayed to Europe this week.
From Washington: "This Christmas, the world is brightened with the hope of peace. When it comes, when hope turns to substance and the guns are quiet once again, it will come because you have pursued it with courage and skill." This was a message from President Johnson to the Armed Forces on Christmas.
Here is a feature by Harry Rosenthal of Associated Press. It says: from Houston. Two Santas brighten the Christmas Eve for 2-year-old Jeffrey Lovell. The first one knocked on his front door and brought presents. The second started his daddy home from the moon. The first wore a red suit and a white beard and ho, ho'd loud enough to be heard down the block. The second was a huge engine spitting flame behind the moon, and thousands of people were awaiting word that it had fired. "Please be informed that there is a Santa Claus" were the first words from Apollo 8 as it emerged from radio silence to inform an anxious world 15 minutes after the fact that the engine had performed its critical burn. "None of us ever expect to have a better Christmas present than this one," said Ken Mattingly of Mission Control. "Thank everyone on the ground for us. You know we couldn't have done it without you," came the reply from Col. Frank Borman, the spacecraft commander. At this point, a Christmas tree came aglow in front of the consoles in Mission Control, and Astronaut Harrison Schmidt read a space version of "A visit from Saint Nicholas" to the crew. "Twas the night before Christmas, and way out in space, the Apollo 8 crew had just won the moon race," it began. The Mission Control crew had delayed the celebration until Jeffrey's daddy, Navy Captain James Lovell, along with Air Force Major William A. Anders and Col. Borman were safely on their way home. Any other Christmas Eve, the families of the astronauts would have been in church for Christmas services, but this year they were all glued to their television sets. The homes all near the Manned Spacecraft Center were decorated. The lawns around the Lovell home and throughout his community of Timber Cove were lined with Mexican style luminarios, and the four Lovell children came out to light them about 7:30. They were just in time. At 8:00, a car drove up carrying a tall Santa Claus with a large sack on his back. He ho ho'd up to the door and knocked loudly. It opened, and there stood Jeffrey Lovell who will be 3 on January 14. Jeffrey recoiled at the sight. His mother held him up, and Jeffrey clung to her, still shying away. "Last year he ran away crying," saying his 15-year old sister Barbara. Earlier, she had to run after him to prevent his blowing out all the luminaries. The other Lovell children, 13-year-old James and 10-year-old Susan watched with great amusement. Finally, the Santa and the children disappeared inside; the presents were put under the tree; presents not to be opened until today. Mrs. Lovell prepared egg nog and cookies for the guests, and they watched a 25-minute televised tour of the moon conducted by the three astronauts. Later, friends took Mrs. Lovell, Barbara, and Jeffrey on a tour of the neighborhood brightly lighted for Christmas. Above them in a clear sky, the quarter moon shone brightly, and the three astronauts, who more than any other men have seen the fruits of creation, pause in their scientific exploration there to beam to the earth the majestic word; from Genesis. "And God created the firmament heavens, and God called the dry land Earth, and God saw that it was good."
Thank you, Jerry.
Roger. We have a newspaper coming in after while; we will give you a little more news later.
Thank you, Jerry; that's nice.
Jerry, we have chlorinated the water, and we're changing the canister now.
Roger, Frank. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston. Would you put the BIOMED switch to the left, and - -
Roger.
We would like to get a crew status report on Jim and Frank when you get a chance.
Both Frank and myself had a meal before bed last night, and I believe that we had about 20 clicks of water, and a good night's rest. Just getting up.
Roger, Jim. Thank you.
Jerry, this is Frank. Do you have any later word on our trajectory and how the charging looks?
Roger. Stand by, Frank, and we'll give you an update.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are looking at a midcourse correction at 104 hours of about 5 feet per second. The tracking is real good. We got you in the center of the corridor and on target.
Understand; 5 feet per second at 104 hours.
That's affirm.
Frank, did you get the word that we deleted the P52 at 96?
Roger. Do you mind if we go ahead and do it now?
Negative; we've deleted it. Your drift rates are small that you don't even need to unless you want to do it.
Okay. We won't.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Frank. In 3 minutes, we are handing the control from Honeysuckle over to Madrid. Over.
Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Buenos dias from Madrid.
... reading ... now.
Apollo 8, Houston. Reading you loud and very noisy.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. You're loud and clear. How me?
You are loud and clear now.
Hey, Jerry, this is Frank. Do you read me?
Roger, Frank.
Okay. I wasn't sure we were lined up. Thank you. Enough ...
Apollo 8, Houston. If you don't need the computer, we would like to have you call up VERB 64 ENTER so that we can do the B-D antenna switching from the ground. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Jim, if you don't need the computer, would you call up VERB 64 ENTER, and we will take care of the antenna B-D switching down here. Over.
Roger.
We just did an automatic maneuver and then get on back to PTC attitude.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. All your systems looking good. Over.
Thank you, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. I got some more newspaper if you would like to hear it.
We would enjoy it.
Roger. We will start out with the world news. On page 1 of the Houston Post: praise for America's Apollo 8 astronauts and hopes for international cooperation in space exploration with the worldwide Christmas Eve messages as the tiny spaceship orbited the moon. Even in the Communist world, there was enthusiasm for man's first voyage to the moon. In Moscow, Soviet scientist Anatoly Besaranov recalled his country and the United States had shared space knowledge before and predicted the Apollo 8 flight would lead to more cooperation. In Cuba, Radio Havana rebroadcast the Voice of America program to tell its listeners of the Apollo 8 speech. Voice officials said it was the first time that any of the U.S. agencies' programs had been carried by Havana radio. Czechoslovakia saw the moon flight through extensive television coverage; and in Budapest, Hungary, people talk of little else on the trains and buses. In the non-Communist world, office workers and Christmas shoppers held their breath as the spacecraft was readied for the blast toward earth. Frenchmen in the street praised American knowhow and the space feat, and some viewers watch television lunar photos cheer "Magnifique!". In London, swarms of Christmas shoppers crowded into shops and pubs to watch television photographs of the moon's craters. Britain's foremost space astronomer, Bernard Lovell, who until a few weeks ago criticized the Apollo 8 project on the grounds that instruments could do the job without risking the astronauts' lives, made it clear that he was deeply impressed by the moon flight. Pope Paul VI said honor to those pioneers of the extension of man's intellect and activity. There were only a few scrooges that "pooh pooh-ed" the Christmas voyage, however. The most notable was Samuel Shenton, secretary of London's Flat Earth Society, who said the public are being balihooed, taken for a ride. How does that grab you, Frank?
It doesn't look too flat from here, but I don't know; maybe something is wrong with our vision.
Roger. Elsewhere in the world news, the Pueblo crew landed at NAS Miramar yesterday afternoon at 14:00, and they will spend a few days there in Balboa Hospital with their families celebrating Christmas. On the local scene here, the Retail Merchants' Association has announced that its Christmas gift exchange policy is going to be the same this year as it was last year; that is, very liberal. Fellows, we will be glad to replace any broken items that you might bring back, too; but, sorry, there won't be any cash refunds.
Okay.
Another little of local news: the County Court House at Huntsville burned down before dawn yesterday, so it looks like they will go in the construction business there again. On the feature page: got a little bit about the waiting families. This one is by Ann James, Post reporter. "We rest on the backside of the moon," said Valerie Anders on Christmas Eve, as she and her family waited for Apollo 8 to get out of the moon orbit and head back toward home. Mrs. Anders had been up since 2:00 a.m. Tuesday, and neighbors had just collected all the youngsters so the family could get some rest while the spacecraft was behind the moon and out of communication. Colonel Frank Borman's home was decorated with four big evergreen wreaths outdoors and sprinkled with powdery snow and decorated with red bows. A tree in the den awaits his safe return, and his pretty blond wife Sue and husky sons, Frederick and Edwin, plan to stay home for the midnight blast out of moon orbit. Ordinarily, they would attend midnight services at St. Christopher's Episcopal Church. The plans were for the family to go to Christmas Day service at 7:00 a.m. Since there are no young children in the Borman home, family Christmas gift giving will simply wait until Colonel Borman comes back with his fantastic holiday gift of the flight to the moon and back. Marilyn Lovell's four youngsters will have an absolutely normal Christmas as far as the kids are concerned, the busy wife of Captain Lovell reported; but talking about presents was out because two of them were sitting right there next to her. "I haven't even had time to change my clothes that I wore last night," Mrs. Lovell said. Adult-to-adult gifts, however, and the Christmas tree will still be right there when Lovell comes home. Here is a good one on the Action Line. There is a little letter to the Action editor. It says, "We intended to pay you Earthlings a surprise visit by a flying saucer last night. We got scared off by some crazy antics of a fat man and a sleigh and three guys in a rocket-powered bucket drag racing around the moon. Is that any way to run a planet?" Signed the boys from Mars. Frank, it looks like the only people around here who aren't impressed by the Apollo 8 is the stock market. Its 30 industrials are down 1.43.
Neil will be crying.
(Laughter) You bet. On the sports page, not too much activity. UCLA is tops in both basketball polls. If you got any particular one you want to ask about, let me know, and I'll tell you if they are in the top ten on either poll. As far as the North - the college All Star game that is going to be played tomorrow is concerned, the North is a slight favorite over the South. Ara Parseghian is the coach of the North team, and he's got six of the Notre Dame troops working for him, so they ought to be pretty tough. The coach of the South team is Frank Howard of Clemson. He says it ain't easy, he quips, to build a team in 4 days to play Notre Dame. Another little item of interest in the sports page is Woody Hayes from Ohio State was named Coach of the Year by the Football Writers' Association. Well, that's about it. Any questions?
No. Thank you very much, Jerry.
Okay, Frank.
Jerry, you can do this every Sunday.
Do you want me to read you the funnies?
No, thanks.
Hey, Frank, did you get the word that Fred made all-district football team?
Yes, thank you. I heard about that before - before the lift-off.
Yes. I thought you heard about that. Now, back to the workday; we need a cryo fan cycle from you.
We're starting right now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Jerry, in a little while, I would like to try out a little P37 exercise based on minus MA. I'll just run one through, and maybe we can get a solution from the ground and see how they compare.
Okay, Jim.
Retro says they are ready to copy.
Roger.
That performance at LOI was absolutely fantastic. You all really hit it on the money; I just couldn't believe it.
Roger. That kinda surprised us, too.
Uh-uh. I hope you're not getting close to the earth. We got another corridor to hit, you know.
We haven't quit yet.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
We'd like to use the computer now if you don't need it now. ...
Roger, Jim. It's yours.
Thank you.
If you can switch it down there without VERB 64, well, go ahead and do it.
We'll give it a whirl, Frank.
Okay.
... are all ... of the earth.
Roger. Thank you, Frank.
Houston. ... pitch and yaw of 10 and 45, aren't you?
That's affirmative, Frank. Pitch 10, yaw 45.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with a battery status report.
Go ahead. We were just talking about the batteries.
Roger. At 96 hours EEP, battery A has 38.95 amp-hours; battery B has 36.35 amp-hours; battery C has 38.46 amp-hours. Your total, 113.76 amp-hours. At 97 plus 50, battery A will be fully charged and will have 40 amp-hours, and you can terminate charge at that time. Over.
At 97:50.
Roger.
We'll give you back VERB 64, Houston..
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
We gave you back VERB 64. I wonder if you could have Guidance figure out a corridor correction at 114 hours for us with a minus 648 cabin.
Okay, Jim. We copy, and now we see we've got VERB 64 back. We'll be back with you in a minute.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. We have a comparison now on your P37.
Roger.
Okay. Based on your vector, the CMC vector, the ground computes 15.3 feet per second on the midcourse, VEI of 36221, a gamma EI of minus 6.51 so it looks like your P37 program is pretty good. Applying your P37 solution to our MSFN vector, however, we get a gamma EI of minus 10.32. We expect these two solutions to converge with a little more tracking and after you get some earth horizon sightings. Over.
Roger. How valuable do you think that the lunar we did just after TPIR as compared to your MSFN tracking? Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Repeat your question, please.
Roger. I was getting curious of the value of onboard tracking in the P23 course close to the moon, in regards to the MSFN tracking that close to the moon. I think there might be a trail-off for onboard navigation, and I think it might be a little bit better than MSFN tracking.
Roger. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I guess the experts would say that the MSFN data was probably best based or the number of sightings that you have taken. However, that's going to be the subject of quite a bit of evaluation, I think, after the mission. Over.
...
Roger, Jim. Be advised that we are beginning to read you very weak, and with a rather loud background noise.
Understand. ...
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read now?
I'm reading - I'm reading you loud and clear.
Roger. Still reading you weak but clearer.
Apollo 8, Houston. You can turn off the battery charger. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Is this Jim?
Roger.
Roger, Jim. Christmas morning around your house was kinda quiet, says Marilyn. She said that they are all thankful the mission has gone so great. They missed having you around the tree this morning, but they wanted to reassure you that your presents are waiting, and the roast beef and Yorkshire pudding will be on the table when you get home.
Hey, that sounds good, Jerry - good old roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.
Yeah, man. Is Frank listening?
Say hello to them for me, will you?
Sure will. Is Frank listening?
Frank's not on the line yet; he will be shortly.
Okay. How about Bill? Is he still asleep?
Bill is still asleep.
Okay. Have Frank give me a holler when he is ready. I've got a message for him, too.
Okay. Sounds good. How is your Christmas, Jerry?
Real good, Jim. Santa Claus struck last night before I came in here on the shift, and I guess we will finish off the unwrapping this morning when I get back.
Right. He was looking for a chimney on 103 here, but he didn't see any.
(Laughter) You could have left the hatch unlocked for him.
I'll think about that one.
Think real hard, Jim. EECOM says he could have slid down the steam duct.
Sounds good. About that time, Bill would have been boiling water.
Hey, Jerry, this is Frank. What's up?
Hi, Frank. Christmas morning has come at the Borman house. And the boys and Susan and your Mom and Dad all send their love. They say for you to stay in there and pitch. Over.
Okay. Thank you. Please reciprocate for me.
Sure will, Frank.
Frank, when Bill wakes up, give me a holler. I've got a message for him, too.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Are the Guidance boys busy this morning?
They say they are.
I just worked out an answer to move my landing longitude 6 degrees east. I just want to compare with what they've got based on the same burn time of 114 hours, based on the bias impact longitude determined from the P37 which is wrong. I've indicated that I need 600 foot per second ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> burn plus, and my ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> changes from a minus 11.6 feet per second. I'd like to have them verify that if I could.
Roger Jim. Standby, and I'll see if they copied all that.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
The voice isn't too great right now, and the Guidance troops didn't get all of that. How about waiting about 2 or 3 minutes? We'll swap OMNI antennas, and then we should get good voice transmission from you and then repeat it. Would you, please?
Roger.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear.
Roger. We're reading you much better now. Jim can go ahead with his transmission to the guidance troops. They have one question before he starts. They would like to know what his GERU was at TIG, 114 hours. Over.
Roger. Wait one. The GERU at TIG was plus 07972.
Roger. Plus 07972.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are ready to copy your data. Over.
Okay, Houston. Based on the P37 with minus MA solution, I got an impact longitude of minus 160.95. I biased it to get an impact latitude - longitude of 163.75. I wanted to change my impact point 30 degrees to the east, and I tried to determine what my P30 burn parameters would be to do this, and I got a ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> burn of minus 11.6 and a ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>C</sub> of plus 600, ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>Y</Y> of zero. Now that changed my previous ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>X</sub> burn from minus 50.2. I just want to know whether that meets with their approval.
Roger, Jim. We copy and will run it through the mill and give you an answer.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with a flight plan update.
Go ahead.
Roger. At 100 hours 30 minutes, change star number 02 from one set to two set. Over.
Roger. Star 02 from one set to two set.
Roger. Also, set number 2, set number 2, change star number 11 to star number 7. Over.
Roger. Eleven to 7.
Roger. Then after star set number 3, initiate PTC again; pitch 10, yaw 45. Over.
Pitch 10, yaw 45.
Roger. Then at 101 hours 30 minutes, delete the earth horizon settings. Over.
101:30, delete the earth horizons sightings.
That's affirmative. The folks here are evaluating the thermal situation. Looks like you will be out of PTC rather at an extended period of time. That's the reason we have you initiating PTC again there around 101 as soon as you finish those three star sightings. We are still working on the - about the next 10 hours after 100 hours. We are looking at the thermal situation, and the star sighting situation, and we will be giving you more updates later on. Over.
Roger. We don't have a thermal problem at all now, do we? All our indications here are normal in here.
Roger. Everything looks okay. I think they're just kinda trying to look down the track aways.
I'm all for keeping it that way.
Roger.
We deleted them.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Frank, I would like to talk to you for a minute or two about the AUTO OPTICS funnies that you have been seeing throughout the mission. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. The problems you have run into so far are due to some unknown source, probably EMI or the like loading your CMC trunnion cell which is now 91, so it doesn't really represent your true trunnion angle. Now this loading problem we don't feel implies any decrease in the reliability in your CMC at all. We think that the best way to circumvent the problem is to cycle the OPTICS ZERO switch first to OFF and then ON prior to using the optics for any purpose. And with that procedure, I think you probably won't have any more problems. Over.
Roger, Jerry. Understand. I do notice one difference. We did preferred REFSMMAT's. The first we had trouble with; the last one worked out as expected. I noticed for the first one that when the option came up, it was for nominal option, whereas for the very same procedure for this last REFSMMAT change, we got ... preferred REFSMMAT option. ...
Roger, Jim. Copy.
Apollo 8, this is Houston with a comeback on your entry navigation calculations. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger. We went through the charts and got exactly the same answer as you got.  Looks like your procedure is very good; looks like it was real good head.  You remembered to average out the velocity. We also went ahead and computed the problem to verify the chart and got a good solution. Over.
Roger.
Thank you very much.
You're welcome.
Now if we can get our state vectors to agree, we'll be in business.
No sweat.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Frank. Is Jim listening?
Listening.
Roger. On your question about the option: PROGRAM 40 sets the preferred flag such that the next P52 will come up option 1, subsequent alignments after that come up option 2. Over.
Roger. Understand. So 40 will have to come up with a TIG burn with an option 1 for us.
Roger. Now concerning your restart that happened in lunar orbit, for the peace of mind of the computer people and the MIT folks, we have a question. Did VERB 34 ENTER to a flashing VERB 51 in P22 cause your restart? Over.
Yes. That sounds like it was it.
Roger. Thank you, Jim.
That must be a "no, no".
Yes, Yes. That's a "no, no".
That almost caused an unscheduled EVA, too.
Apollo 8, Houston. BIOMED switch center. Over.
Three, two, one -
MARK.
Roger. Your mark.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. It is about time for us to start keeping track of some command module RCS temperatures; so when you get a chance, we'd like the reading now, and we'll try to repeat it about every 8 hours or so.
Okay. We'll get them for you right now.
Roger.
You want the motor off the test meter, right?
That's affirmative.
The 5C is pegged high.
Roger. 5C pegged high.
5D is pegged high.
Roger. D, high.
So's 5D. 6A is high; 6B is high; 6C is 5 volts; 6D is pegged high.
Apollo 8, Houston. Roger. Understand. 5C and 5D are pegged high; 6A and 6D are pegged high; 6 Charlie is 5 volts; and 6 Delta pegged high. Over.
That's Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger. Go ahead.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're showing quad A running a little bit warmer than the other quads. If you remember, I mentioned before that we were coming into a period of time here where we were going to spend a lot of time with no PTC going. We'd like for you to try to favor quad A if you can in the shade, and do whatever you can to keep that temperature from getting out of hand. Over.
Roger. I'm only reading 121 on quad A.
Roger.
Quad C is the highest temperature we have; it's 142.
Roger, Frank. We are more interested in the tank temperatures than the quad temperatures. Over.
Roger. I understand. Now listen, if you think it is that important, we'll just keep PTC-ing it and not even do anything.
Negative. There's no sweat right now. We're watching it, and we just wanted to let you know that this thing is being looked at. If we get anywhere near a situation where we feel we ought to change, we'll go back to PTC or cool it.
Okay. Thank you. We'll do our best, but it is kind of hard, though. You are sort of subject of spatial geometry: wherever the stars and the moon happens to be, that's where you point.
Roger. We understand. We're going to keep an eye on it down here, and we'll keep you appraised.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Pass the word to Jim that on these marks that are coming up, pretty important that he remember to record his DELTA-R and ΔV|DELTA-V and trunnion. We are working low bit rate down here, and so we're not going to be able to record that data from here. Over.
We are recording them all.
Houston, Apollo 8. Did you read that we are recording all the DELTA-R and ΔV|DELTA-V and trunnion ...
Roger, Frank. Thanks.
Jerry, Apollo 8.
Roger. Go ahead.
As luck would have it, we got the sun almost directly ahead on top of us here.
Roger. We understand, but tank temperature is holding steady, so we are all right.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. The helium tank temperature that we are watching on quad A has only gone up 1 degree in all this work that you are doing, so we don't consider it to be too terribly serious. What we would like to do, as soon as you finish this P23 work, is rather than go back into PTC, let's just roll her over 180 degrees and put quad A on the cool side, and hold it that way until your next activity comes up, which is around 102:30. Over.
Okay. Fine.
Okay, Jerry. We're through with PROGRAM 23. We're just going to roll here to get the sun off quad A, if that's what you want.
Roger, Frank. Good deal.
It should be getting cool now, Jerry.
Roger, Frank. So far we haven't seen the temperature start back down again. We expect to see it, though.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Give us the word if you want us to maneuver back here before that time that you ..., please.
Wilco.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Frank. We have some data that was missed on your P23. We'd like you to read it down to us if you have time.
Roger. We will in just a minute.
Roger.
Go ahead. What do you want?
Roger. On star number 2, the sixth mark, we missed DELTA-R and ΔV|DELTA-V.
Sixth mark, that's - did Lovell tell you to do this? Come on, Carr; come clean. Did he ask you to ask for this?
Who?
Jim Lovell.
Negative. Uh-uh. We really missed it.
It's all zeros, and all zeros.
Roger. All zeros, all zeros. Okay. On star number 7, we missed the trunnion on marks 1, 2, and 3.
On 1, trunnion was 03235; on 2, it was 03240; on 3, it was 03241.
Okay, Frank. And then the last one is on star number 1; we missed the trunnion on mark 5.
04064.
Roger, 04064.
Righto.
Thank you, Frank.
You're welcome, Jerry.
That Lovell's getting pretty proficient.
Not bad.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Was that last number you read down to me mark 2 on star number 1?
That's right. Star number 1, mark 2.
Roger. Thank you. Now that one got you on guidance.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. You're back under our influence again. Over.
Very good. Things start speeding up now, huh?
Roger. You've been in for about 20 minutes.
Very good.
Jerry, this is Jim.
Go ahead, Jim.
Find out from the Guidance group if a midcourse maneuver of minus 4.8 to access corridor at 14 hours would be better than the 15.2 I came up with first.
Okay. Minus 4.8.
Right.
We have already started checking it, Jim. I bet you think you sneaked that P37 past us.
Big brother is watching.
Affirm.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. I just wondered how temp on quad A tank is doing.
We have seen no improvement as yet, Frank.
How hot is it?
Eighty-six degrees.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Frank, we are going to establish a range sequence now. We would like to keep silence on the net for about 3 minutes. Over.
Very well.
Apollo 8, Houston. Range sequence complete. Over.
Thank you.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear by me.
I wasn't reading you for a while. I read you loud and clear now.
Roger, Frank.
I wanted to know what a range sequence test was, Jerry.
I was afraid you was going to ask that. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. This range sequence is a phenomenon we get on down-voice backup; in this mode, the ranging and the voice share the same channels, so we have to periodically check and make sure that they are not interfering with each other. Over.
Thank you. These flights are very educational.
Roger. We are learning a little bit down here, too.
I hope you're not studying reentry.
No, we're fat on those, Frank.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Frank. We would like for you to go back into PTC now. Your helium tank temperature is still holding about the same. And we are going to try PTC to even things out. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Is Jim listening?
He's off the air right now.
Roger, Frank. Let him know that we've compared his latest P37, and the state vectors have converged to - they are very, very close now.
Your state vector and our state vector are very, very close.
That's affirmative, Frank.
Is that right, Jerry? Okay. I'll tell him. Thank you.
Roger.
Don't let his head get big, though.
You guys are going to make it impossible to live with him. It always was pretty hard.
Houston. How do you read Apollo 8?
Apollo 8, Houston. Say again.
Hello Michael, we lost lock and Bill hit COMMAND RESET to get the lock back on again, but you're welcome to the antenna.
Okay, Frank. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Good morning, Michael.
Good morning.
Or is it afternoon?
Apollo 8, Houston. You've got a lot of background noise and about unreadable. We're trying to get a better OMNI.
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear.
Okay. You're loud and clear. Is this Bill?
None other.
I got a message for you while you were asleep. Valerie said to tell you that she and the kids are leaving for church about 11:30 and eagerly awaiting your return. She said presents are magically starting to appear under the Christmas tree again so it looks like a double barrel Christmas. Over.
You can't beat a deal like that. How was Christmas at your house today?
Early and busy as usual. I told Michael you guys are up there, and he said who's driving?
That's a good question. I think Isaac Newton is doing most of the driving right now.
Say again.
I think Isaac Newton is doing most of the driving right now.
Roger. We copy.
Tell Valerie and the kids a Merry Christmas for me, Mike, and tell them I'll see them there in a while.
I sure will, and you might tell Frank if he's got any messages his people are about 10 feet away.
He said "bah humbug."
Howdy, how are you all?
You've got a whole row of smiling faces in the back room, Frank.
Very good. Will they be proud of me: I'm using the Exer-Genie right now.
Don't overdo it.
I won't.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over,
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Quad Able helium tank temperature has dropped very slightly and is looking pretty good to us now.
Thank you, Michael.
Righto, and I've got a procedure for Jim I would like to read up. It involves bringing the LM and the CSM state vectors to the earth's sphere of influence. Over.
Alright. Stand by.
Okay.
He's getting his hat on now. Whose procedure is this, Michael?
Oh, it's the summation of the opinions of all our experts down here. I got it from Mr. Colossus, Gunther Sabionski.
Very good. I want to make sure it wasn't an Aldrin special.
I'm sorry you're broken up. Don't say again. (Laughter)
Merry Christmas, Bud.
Yes, Merry Christmas up there, Jim. I've got a procedure when you are ready to copy.
Okay. I just got on my headset; just let me get a pencil and paper, and I will copy it.
Okay.
Okay, Mike.
Okay. The purpose is to bring the LM and the CSM state vectors to earth's sphere of influence. Step one: Verb 37 ENTER, 23 ENTER. Step two: At NOUN 70, at NOUN 70, load in register 1, 2, and 3 the following numbers. Register 1, 00002; register 2, five balls; register 3, 00210. Step 3: proceed on NOUN 70, NOUN 70. Step 4: proceed on NOUN 25, 25. Step 5: do not proceed on NOUN 18. Wait for 30 seconds; then do VERB 37 ENTER, 00 ENTER. End of procedure. Over.
Okay. As I understand that the reason for this procedure is to bring the LM and CSM state vectors back to the earth's sphere of influence; is that correct?
That's correct.
Okay. To do it we go VERB 37 ENTER, 23 ENTER; and at the NOUN 70, we'll load in register 1, four balls 2; register 2, all balls; and register 3, two balls 210. We'll proceed on NOUN 70 and proceed on NOUN 25. We'll not proceed on 18. We'll wait 30 seconds, and we'll do a VERB 37 ENTER, 00 ENTER.
That's affirmative. Apollo 8.
I'm just kinda curious, Mike; I thought this was done for us. I thought the computer took care of this little problem.
Roger. Normally, it is done automatically, Jim; and had you done the P23's exactly as scheduled, it would have been, but there was some doubt P23 was stopped about 7 minutes prior to the transition point and just to be absolutely sure, we included this procedure. Over.
Okay. Tell Buzz I sure could use his eye-patch.
Roger. I understand. Buzz had one on Gemini X, worked real well.
Mike, do you want me to do this procedure now?
That's affirmative, Jim. Now at your convenience.
Did you see guidance? Is the flag set?
We're set, that's right.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Thank you, Jim. We copied your DSKY work there, and it's looking just fine to us now.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
You know, one thing you can pass on to the program office - something you might try working on right away is - -
Can you stand by, Apollo 8?
Apollo 8, can you stand by? We'll try to get you a better antenna; you're just about unreadable.
Alright.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are right in between antennas and if you can wait about 5 minutes with your message, we can have better COMM then.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. You're loud and clear now, Frank. Go ahead and say what you were saying about the program office.
They ought to get some moving out on some way to fix these windows. The three windows, the hatch window and the two side windows, really it's a shame, in fact, that they are almost totally unusable, because they got so gummed up.
Roger. I sure agree. We copy so far on the windows that 2 and 4 are in excellent shape and 1 and 5 are sort of mediocre and 3 is just about totally unusable.
Three is totally unusable; 1 and 5 are unusable for any kind of photography.
Roger.
And, Mike, that sure puts the CMP in a bad light, you know, when you can't see where you are going.
Yes. And when you're sitting between two guys that won't tell you, too. (Laughter)
That's right. You think they will share a window? No soap. You might also note the optics are very good visibility; so far, no coating at all.
Glad to hear that, Jim.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We copy Jim doing a P52, and I'm standing by with a maneuver PAD for midcourse 5 any time at your convenience.
Okay. Ready to copy, Mike.
Roger, Jim. This is midcourse maneuver number 5, and it's a RCS/G&N, and it's 31700, not applicable, not applicable. Are you with me?
With you.
Good. 103:59:52.86, minus 00050, plus all zeros, plus 00001 000 334 001 five zeros, plus 00190 00050 014 00050. Are you still with me? Over.
Still with you.
Good. 413020 183, Shaula, down 064, left 06, plus 0747, minus 16410 12988 36301 146:46:40; north set of stars, Sirius and Rigel, roll 308, pitch 209, yaw 357. Remarks: use high-speed procedure with minus MA. Over.
Roger, Houston. MCC 5, RCS/G&N - are you with me?
I'm with you, Jim.
31700, NA, NA, 103:59:52.86, minus 00050, plus all zeros, plus 00001 000 334 001, all zeros, plus 00190 00050 014 0050 413020 183, Shaula, down 064, left 06, plus 0747, minus 16410 12988 36301 146:46:40; Sirius, Rigel, 308 209 357; use high-speed procedure with minus MA.
Roger. And could you go to ACCEPT, please, and we're going to send you a P27 load consisting of a LM state vector and a target load for MCC 5.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. We'd like to dump your waste water tank down to 25 percent; we'd like to do it before the midcourse, for tracking reasons. So if it is convenient with you, if you'll start right now, we'll dump on down to 25.
Roger. We'll get right with it.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We got those loads in and verified; you can go back BLOCK at your computer. And George Low says he's working on that window problem at 6, or spacecraft 104. You just happen to have the wrong spacecraft.
That's the wrong statement; we've got the right spacecraft. I'll clue you, if it keeps going this way for 2 more days, we've got not only the right spacecraft, but we've got the best spacecraft.
It'll keep going.
Apollo 8. We're starting the dump now, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Okay. We're starting the waste water dump now.
Okay, Bill. Thank you.
That's a blizzard.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. I need a PRD|Pop Romeo Dog on all three and a status report on the LMP.
Roger. The LMP's PRD hasn't moved an inch since we took off. And that's the one the CMP did have, still 0.64. And I just had about 5-1/2 hours sleep, and I'm in the process of scarfing up a meal; and I've been drinking lots of water, feeling good, and that's about it.
Okay. And you got a PRD on the other two.
Yes. The CMP is ready to report. The CMP is reading 1.2 rem.
And the CDR: I got stuck with somebody else's, but mine reads now - my new one reads 2.02 rems. I don't know if there is a message there or not.
He's starting to glow in the dark.
Yes. You should have hung on to the one you had. It sounded a little bit better. I copy left to right 2.02, 0.12, and 0.64. Over.
Roger.
Thank you, sir.
What have they measured in our - what have they measured on that, I guess you would call it the VABABR, or VABD?
We're sending the boy to the back room to find out.
Find out what it is, or what it's reading?
First one and then the other.
We'll need both answers up here, too.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Bill's VA and VR reading that he requested is 0.13. Over.
Roger. Looks like you've got a little discrepancy here.
Yes, I agree.
You ought to give those guys a chance to go back to sleep and calibrate those things.
Apollo 8, Houston. We've just passed 25 percent and you can terminate your waste water dump, please.
Okay. Will do.
Believe it or not, our gage is 5 percent behind yours.
Yes, John said that he has been noticing that.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Yes. We are going to switch antennas from Madrid to Goldstone in about 3 minutes. You should hear the glitch.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. Just for information, would the perigee reading and NOUN 42 be such a big minus number for such a small burn? We are reading minus 03137 now.
Roger. Understand; NOUN 42 perigee reads minus 03137. Over.
Roger. We are going to PROGRAM 30 after you give us the target load, and I didn't think there would be that much of a change for such a small burn.
Roger. Stand by. We will check into it, Jim.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. We don't think there's any problem or any funnies in this perigee prediction of minus 03137. It's a Keplerian prediction, and it's not very accurate. Now we have taken your vector from the downlink and run it through a make-believe external ΔV|DELTA-V maneuver down here, and we get precisely the correct answer. Over.
Roger. Understand that you figure just because of the conics solution that it comes up.
That's affirmative. The Kepler solution is just pretty gross.
Okay. I was just kind of curious. I could see differences when we were talking about LOI burns, but this being such a short one, I thought it wouldn't be that much difference. I understand.
Mike, this is Frank.
Go ahead.
You are monitoring and seeing if we get any inadvertent engine firing all the time, aren't you?
Well, we can't tell when you're in low bit rate. When you're in high bit rate, that's right.
Okay. If we crank up high bit rate and just have you take a checkout look at them?
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Since you're on OMNI D (Dog) at this time, we're sort of 180 out of phase for the high-gain lock antennas. As soon as we can get high-gain lock, then we'll - -
Okay. We will take the antennas and get on the high gain as soon as we can.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. We've done some more checking, and we confirm that that is the correct Keplerian prediction on NOUN 42 minus 03137, just like you said.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We are going to be doing a ranging sequence; if we can eliminate voice for a couple of minutes, we would appreciate it.
Roger. We will.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Our ranging is complete, and we have been monitoring your thruster firings, and they show what appears to be very normal damp activities. Over.
Thank you. I guess it was associated with the water vent.
Roger. Understand, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Frank, we've got about 2-1/2 minutes to ignition, and we're still showing some of your SCS switches not set up as per checklist; specifically, rate LOW, deadband MINIMUM, and your BMAG mode at attitude one, rate two.
Okay. Thank you.
And your manual attitude switches in RATE COMMAND.
Right.
Apollo 8, Houston.
MARK.
One minute to ignition. Over.
Roger. We concur.
Apollo 8, Houston.
MARK.
Twenty seconds to ignition.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Jim.
Roger. We burned on time, 14 seconds, attitude nominal. Our residuals were plus 2 in VG<sub>X</sub>, minus 1 in VG<sub>Y</sub> nothing in VG<sub>Z</sub>. Our EMS stopped about 6.2 and continued counting after the burn.
Roger. Understand 14 seconds, burn on time, nominal attitude, two-tenths X, one-tenth Y, and nothing - minus one-tenth Y, and nothing Z; and you put 6.2 on the EMS, and it continued to count after the burn. Is that affirmative?
No. We put the burn - we put the burn ΔV|DELTA-V in the EMS, and after the burn, it was still counting.
Roger. Understand.
Still counting up.
Understand.
Okay, Houston. We transferred the state vector to the LM slot.
Roger, Jim. Thank you, and I still don't understand you on this EMS. Counted down from 5 to zero normally and then continued through zero in a negative way, and now it's reading minus 6.2? Is that affirmative?
Roger. That's right. It was counting up when we shut it off. Last time I saw it, it was 6.9. Now Frank just put it on AUTO again with the ΔV|DELTA-V function switch in ΔV|DELTA-V, and it jumped six-tenths. Then he tried the second time, and it stayed at zero so we really don't know what the story is.
Roger. Understand you.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Frank.
I guess you want us to resume PTC, right?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'd like you to resume the PTC attitude, pitch 010, yaw 045; and then come out of it again for your P23 that you're scheduled for about another hour and 10 minutes, in another hour and 10 minutes.
Roger.
Mike, this is Frank. Is this TV still scheduled for 104:50?
That's affirmative, Frank, if you can manage it.
Okay.
How's it going with the TV, Frank? Are we - can the networks count on having it on schedule? Over.
Yes, we can have it on schedule. We don't have much to do, but we'll perform for you.
Okay. We have a bunch of filter experts standing by if you need any advice.
Well, we're just going to have to just do it inside today because there are no good shots of the moon or the earth; the sun's too darn bright.
I think it's raining out there.
Yes, that's what we thought.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. On this EMS, when I put it in ΔV|DELTA-V, it was reading zero; then I switched to AUTO. Sometimes it will count to 19 or 20 feet per second. I guess that is what happened.
Roger. Understand when you put it to AUTO, it maybe will keep counting up to as much as 19 to 20 feet per second.
Just when you put it to AUTO; it will start counting on some occasion, by itself.
Understand.
Mike, we're ready when you are.
We're ready.
Say again.
Yes, we're ready, Frank. We're all squared away and eagerly standing by.
You got your make-up on?
Yes. Have we got a picture?
Negative, Frank.
How about now, Houston?.
Negative, Frank.
We don't seem to have much luck today, but don't call for a repairman yet. It may be our camera here.
Any results yet, Mike?
Negative, Frank. It may be that it hasn't warmed up properly.
Okay. We've had it on for a while. Are you getting our FM okay?
Okay, Frank. There, we got it. It's coming in loud and clear. We look like we're looking at your hat and now the MDC.
Okay. Well, good afternoon. This is the Apollo 8 crew. And how is it focusing now, Houston?
It's looking good. If you can hold the thing still, there's sort of a time delay. Any motion at all there ruins our picture.
Tell me if there is any difference in it now.
It's looking good now.
Okay, fine.
It looks like you're okay, but somebody else is upside down.
Okay. That's right. That's Jim Lovell. What we thought we'd do today was just show you a little bit about life inside Apollo 8. We've shown you the scenes of the moon, the scenes of the earth, and we thought we'd invite you into our home. It's been our home at least for 4 days as you can see on the instrument panel. We mark off each day on the instrument panel. We're four down, and we're working on the fifth day. Of course, we're all looking forward to the landing on Friday. Down here in the part of the spacecraft that we call the lower equipment bay, we have the President's adviser on physical fitness, Captain Jim Lovell, about to undergo an exercise program that we do every day. You notice that he floats around very freely. He just bumped his head on the optics, used for our navigating. He's working with an exercise device that's designed to keep the muscles in shape. Now another very important function of our spacecraft is the computer, and I thought you might be interested in seeing what we have here, the displays that give us all the information about our burn, about navigating, and about the velocity that we use during entry and retrofire on earth-orbital missions. You can see it's controlled by a DSKY, or similar to a typewriter keyboard, and the things that go in and out of that are absolutely miraculous. It's done a fantastic job for us, and Jim Lovell has done an excellent job operating it. Now another very important thing whether you're in space or the ground is eating, and I've asked Bill Anders to show you how we eat up here in the flight. Pardon the picture while we move around here and change cameras. The food that we use is all dehydrated; it comes prepackaged in vacuum-sealed bags. You notice that all Bill has to do to keep it in one place is let go of it. Except for the air currents in the spacecraft, it would stay perfectly still. He gets out his handy, dandy scissors and cuts the bag. The food is varied, generally pretty good. If that doesn't sound like a rousing endorsement, it isn't, but nevertheless, it's pretty good food. You can see that Bill is very clever. He does things swiftly. Actually, those food bags are stuck together because they've been vacuum packed in plastic.
What do you have today, Bill, for dinner?
Well, here we have some cocoa; should be good. I'll be adding about 5 ounces of hot water to that. These are little sugar cookies, some orange juice, corn chowder, chicken and gravy, and a little napkin to wipe your hands when you're done. I'll prepare some orange juice here.
Okay. You can see that he's taking his scissors and cutting the plastic end off a little nozzle that he's going to insert the water gun into. The water gun dispenses a half-ounce burst of water per click. Here we go; Bill has it in now, and the water is going in. I hope that you all had better Christmas dinners today than us, but nevertheless, we thought you might be interested in how we eat.
Roger. I haven't heard any complaints down here, Frank. We'll bring you up to speed on your food when you get back.
Very good.
Looks like a happy home you've got up there.
Ordinarily, we let these drinks settle for 5 or 10 minutes, but Bill's going to drink it right now. Then, to get on with the program, he cuts open another flap, and you'll see a little tube comes out - -
This is not a commercial.
- - and he drinks his delicious orange drink. Maybe I should say he drinks his orange drink. He's usually not that fast. Bill is really in a hurry today. Well, that's what we eat. Now another very important part of the spacecraft is the navigation station or the optics panel. And we - just a minute; Bill wants to say something.
That's good; but not quite as good as good old California orange juice.
Bill's from Florida.
Okay. Now if you'll let me have the camera, Jim, I'll show the people where you do most of your work. Okay. Bill, can you explain it?
If I can clean up some of Bill's food around here, and have it away - Down in this area is called the LEB or the lower equipment bay, and we have our optics positioning equipment right here. We do all our navigation down here by sighting on stars and on horizons of either the moon or the earth. And this is where we find out exactly where we are in space, what direction, and how fast we are traveling. And our computer, as Frank has mentioned, takes information and tells us how to maneuver to get home safely. I work with the scanning telescope and the sextant, and occasionally, if I get too busy, I just sort of float out of sight and go up into the tunnel which is the tunnel to the hatch of the lunar module which we don't have onboard, of course.
Now that's about all we have for today. I - each and every one of us wish each and every one of you a very Merry Christmas. And, I guess we'll see you tomorrow, and we'll be landing early Friday morning. Merry Christmas from Apollo 8.
Roger. Merry Christmas from the ground, Apollo 8, and thank you very much for the guided tour. We really enjoyed it.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Mike.
We're suggesting attitude deadband MAX and rate HIGH.
You're right. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Frank.
How soon will they tell us what effect midcourse had on our trajectory, Mike?
Oh, the longer we track, the smarter we'll get; but stand by one for a pertinent answer.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Tentatively, midcourse correction at 122 hours is zero; and in about an hour and a half, we'll have some track data to confirm that.
Okay. Thank you.
We're going to have something to eat here, Mike; just taking it easy.
Roger. Understand, Frank.
Did you get another shotgun for Christmas?
No, I'm missing enough with the one I have.
That's what Edwin told me; I thought maybe you might want to try another one.
What was it, 40 shots at four birds?
Oh, negative, Frank. I'm 100 percent, one bird per box.
Then you and I are in the same fix.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
It appears that we did a grave injustice to the food people. Just after our TV show, Santa Claus brought us a TV dinner each, which was delicious, turkey and gravy, cranberry sauce, grape punch; outstanding.
Roger, Jim. Glad to hear it. Now we're down a here eating cold coffee and bologna sandwiches.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger. We've got an awful lot of these stars to mark on now, Mike, and they were having some concern about the PTC. Will you let us know if we stay in one position too long, or if we have to knock off and do some PTC?
Will do, Frank.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are monitoring your temperatures. The quads all look good. We will continue to do so, and we expect no difficulty with them during the P23 work.
Thank you.
Our highest tank temperature now is C.
Understand; C is the hot one.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Bill. We would like to talk about your high-gain antenna sometime when you get a minute.
Okay. Just a second, Mike.
About 5 minutes, Mike, we'll be done here.
Houston, Apollo 8. About the high-gain antenna.
Okay, Bill. We think it would be an extremely worthwhile thing to find out how it operates in the AUTO REACQ mode, and we propose running a test on it in that mode from 109 to 111 hours GET. Over.
Okay. We'll do that.
Okay. I have about a - -
We'll try it on the way out.
We have a detailed procedure which we can read up to you anytime you're ready.
Go ahead.
Okay. We suggest the start time 109 hours GET, stop time 111 hours, and you'll be in a PTC. We're requesting a left roll rate, which we notice that you've been preferring, a left roll rate of 1 revolution per hour, and this is in your present PTC attitude (i.e., pitch 10 degrees, 010 degrees, and yaw 45 degrees). The procedure is this: step 1, stop at roll angle 150 degrees; acquire - this is step 2 - acquire in MANUAL mode; three, switch to AUTO NARROW BEAM; four, make sure tracking in AUTO mode then switch to AUTO REACQ mode; five, position the high-gain antenna - -
Wait a minute, Houston.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay. Whoa, whoa. Standing by.
I'm still starting.
Okay. Make sure tracking in AUTO and then what?
Make sure tracking in AUTO, and then switch to AUTO REACQ mode. Over.
Okay. Will do.
Okay. Step 5, position high-gain antenna pitch and yaw control to predicted earth's rise angles, and those angles are yaw 50 degrees, pitch minus 40 degrees. Over.
Okay.
Okay. Two more steps. Step 6, remain on high-gain antenna in this mode for two REV's. Do not switch to OMNI anytime during these two REV's, and maintain mode configuration of voice and data. We expect loss of track should be no more than 15 minutes per REV. Over.
Roger.
And the final step, 7, if any problem arises, go back to your initial gimbal angles of 10 degrees pitch, 45 degrees yaw, and 150 degrees roll; reacquire and go to AUTO mode. Over.
Yes, I guess there ought to be a step 4A which says start roll again, right?
That's affirmative. Excuse me there, that's affirmative.
Okay. If - let's see, if we - I don't understand your last comment. If we get into a problem, you want us to go back to 150 degrees roll?
Well, all we want you to do is go ahead and reacquire in the AUTO mode, Bill. And it looks like that would be one way of doing it. But all we're saying is, you know, if you want to talk to us about something, or you have my other problems, or you don't like the way it looks, anything at all, just go ahead and reacquire in the AUTO mode.
Yes, why don't we just say if we do have problems, it doesn't pick it up when it's supposed to, give it a good try, and then call you up on the OMNI's or position ourselves and we'll talk about it and try for another two REV's,.
That's just fine, Bill.
Okay. It's worked. We tried it once or twice on the way out, but the one modification is once it did break lock, and go to its MANUAL position, but I switched to the OMNI's in between. That sounds fine.
Bill, could you run through that again? We're not reading you too loud, and would you say again what you tried on the way out, please.
On the way out, they gave us some REACQ angles which we used, and once it broke lock and re-positioned itself, why, it went over to the OMNI's and waited till we got to near breaking lock again and switched back and snapped right in there.
Roger. Thank you. We copy.
We have a few more stars to get, and then we'll give it a try.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Bill. We got a bunch of tapes of some of your favorite music down here. You be interested in hearing a little background on the S-band?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. For some reason, we suddenly got a PROGRAM 01 and no attitude light on our computer.
We confirm that.
Stand by one, Jim. We're working on a procedure for getting you cranked back up again.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Jim, while we're working on this procedure, we'd like to know did you select 01, and you get a VERB 37 ENTER, 01 ENTER?
Let's see, I'm not too sure, Mike. I might have done that, yes.
Okay.
We have star 01 coming up, now that might have been the reason.
Okay. We understand. Why don't you just hold what you've got on your DSKY, and we'll be with you shortly.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Could you or Bill give us a better OMNI antenna, please?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. Frank, our procedure is to select P00, and from P00 go to P51, and get a platform alignment. After you've done that, we will send you up a P27, a REFSMMAT, and then you can do P52 REFSMMAT options. Then you'll be back in business. Over.
Okay, Mike. Thank you.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Say again. Over.
Okay. We've completed a P51 now. You want us to try a P52, or you want us to wait till we can put a REFSMMAT in?
Stand by one, will you, please, Frank?
Roger.
We're putting together a P27 load for you now, Frank; that's the reason for the delay. We just want to make sure we don't overlook anything before we send it up to you.
Okay. We'll just sit tight then. We've got a good P51. We'll just wait till you put in a REFSMMAT, and then, of course, we'll fine align over to that, right?
That's right, that's exactly right. Just stand by.
Mike, this is Frank again.
Go ahead.
I suggest that we go ahead while you're doing that, do a P52 here; and let it do an automatic and just tweak this up. Jim had to use Rigel and Sirius, and they're pretty close together. And although we got a zero difference for the star angle, that might not be a bad idea just to try a 52 here.
We'd rather not do that, Frank. Stand by one.
Alright. We won't do a thing.
Frank, we feel that procedure that you're talking about is really not required, and it's sort of wasting your time. You'd still have to - upon completion of that, we'd have to send you a new REFSMMAT, and you'd have to go ahead and do P52 to that REFSMMAT in addition. Over.
We understand that. Go ahead. We'll wait for your REFSMMAT.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. If you'd go P00 and ACCEPT, we have our P27 ready. We'll send you up a REFSMMAT. Over.
Roger. P00 and ACCEPT.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Frank, we'd like to make sure you understand that when you do your P52, you want to select option 1, the preferred option, because those are the registers we're blinking now with this P27.
Roger. Option 1; thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. We got a good load in; it's your computer. Go to BLOCK.
Okay.
Roger. Stand by.
And you can go ahead with your P52 at your convenience.
We're going ahead right now.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. When Jim gets to the end of P52, he's got a flashing VERB 37. We'd like him to not proceed, to hold at that point; we'd like to read some bits and pieces out of the computer at that time. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, if Anders has got time to give us a countdown, could we get the BIOMED switch from center to left?
Two, one -
MARK.
Did you take that 1.7-second time delay into account?
Sorry about that.
Okay. Houston, you have it.
Thank you, Jim. And I'll give you at estimate here on how long we want to hold at this point; it won't be too much longer.
Roger. It was my goof: I must have put in 3701 instead of 3723 and 501.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We have got a flight plan suggestion for you.
Go ahead.
Go ahead and delete the remainder of the P23's that you're working on now, go back to PTC attitude, and then pick up where it says 108 hours in the flight plan to pick up again there with your P23, or if you prefer to slip that time a couple of hours, if you want to get some rest in between.
I think that's a good idea; we'll do that.
Okay.
Mike, what does this do to our state vector?
Not a thing. We've looked at your state vector, and it's good.
So we didn't lose all the NAV we had just accomplished, right?
Stand by one on that, Jim. I don't know; I'm checking.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. I say again, your state vector is just fine; it's still ticky-poo, and the reason we're holding here is that we're checking to see if any P23 information was lost. That's reason one, and the second reason is that your W-matrix shares some computer memory cells with P01, and we are getting a clarification on the status of your W-matrix before we proceed. Over.
Roger, Michael.
We'll go ahead and start heading over to the PTC attitude.
Very good.
Do you need that high gain any more, Mike?
Negative. We don't need it any more.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger, Frank. We're coming up on time for an oxygen purge on all three fuel cells. It might be a good time to do it while we are waiting here.
Fine.
Alright. Mike, we are going to purge the three fuel cells, oxygen only.
That's correct. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. That's enough on fuel cell number 1; if you'd start on two please.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're in low bit rate now. Last time we saw you, you were still purging. Over.
Roger. ...
You're unreadable, but request that you end your purge.
Roger. We ended our purge.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. I've got a short procedure I would like to read up to you on your DSKY, and I'd like to explain what it is. Your W-matrix shared some memory locations with P01; therefore, the W-matrix that you have right now is not a good one, and we would not want you to continue your P23 sightings with that matrix. So the procedure I'm going to give you is going to cause the matrix to reinitialize itself prior to your next P23, when you go into P23. And this will put you back with the value of the W-matrix which you loaded after TEI, you remember, that 3303 thing. And if this has any further effects on the flight plan, we're in the process of sorting that out, and if need be, we'll send you up a revised sighting schedule later, both with the COMM and loss of COMM case. Over.
Okay. Stand by, and I'll get something to copy with.
Okay.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. Insert without releasing the flashing VERB 37 the following: VERB 25 NOUN 07 ENTER, 77 ENTER, 40 ENTER, ENTER, VERB 37 ENTER, 00 ENTER. Over.
Understand. We insert VERB 37 without releasing, is that correct?
Roger. You should have flashing 37 on your DSKY now, and without releasing that flashing 37, go ahead with the VERB 25, et cetera.
Roger. Okay. I see what you mean. Okay. We'll insert VERB 25, NOUN 07 ENTER, 77 ENTER, 40 ENTER, ENTER, reinsert VERB 37 ENTER, 00 ENTER.
That's all correct. Say, if you've got any questions about that, we would be happy to answer them.
Roger. Are we cleared to do that now?
That's affirmative, Jim.
Roger.
Hey, Mike, this is Frank.
Go ahead, Frank.
Is there any danger that this might have screwed up any other part of memory that would be involved with entry or anything like that?
Frank, all indications are that there is absolutely no problem with anything in the computer memory other than the W-matrix. However, we are continuing to look at it, and if there is any doubt in our mind, we will ask you to dump the memory locations for us later. Over.
Okay. Fine.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. We thought you might be interested in knowing, based on 2-1/2 hours worth of track after your last midcourse, and looking ahead, we're predicting the midcourse correction at 122 hours will be less than 1 foot per second. And keep it on going to entry interface minus 2 hours, we're predicting 2 foot per second midcourse at that time. Now those numbers will be refined; we'll get about another 8 hours of track on you before we amend them. Over.
Sounds like we're on pretty good trajectory.
Can't hardly beat it.
After we do these next P23's, I'll see what our P37 gives us. What's that midcourse, 122 hours that has practically zero?
Yes. It's looking to be less than 1 foot per second, about four-tenths of a foot per second right now. And then the one before entry, at 2 hours before entry interface, is looking to be about 2 feet per second.
Roger. Well, okay. I'll run a P37, and we can just compare the difference.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger. Got the JOD back on watch again. We want to make sure we don't overdo the star sightings at the expense of thermal control, so you might keep an eye on us and give us a NO-GO if we start getting too hot on one side.
Roger. Will do, Bill. Has Jim gone to bed?
No, I'm right here. We're going to start doing cislunar NAV right now, and Bill's up in the left-hand seat.
Roger. Understand; you're going to do some P23's now. We thought you were going to take a rest and do them later.
No, Frank is asleep now. We'll get these out of the way. So I'm coming over to do a trunnion alignment at this time, and then we'll go into the P23.
Okay, Jim. There's one thing before you get started on the P23. What we told you before, we still think is absolutely correct. The only thing in the computer memory that is changed by that P02 is the W-matrix. However, as an additional precaution, we'd like to dump the computer memory and go through it and check it bit by bit and make sure everything is exactly copacetic. Over.
Okay. Do you want to do that now?
Affirmative. We're getting Goldstone configured for it; it'll be just a minute. And while we're doing that, I can read you this procedure if you're ready to copy.
Okay. Stand by one, and I'll be ready to copy pretty soon.
Thank you.
Go ahead.
Okay. We'd like a VERB 01 NOUN 01 ENTER, 333 ENTER, and then we'd like for you to read us register 1. Register 1 we expect will be a 10 000, and if register 1 is equal to that, then what that means is that the computer will dump its erasable memory twice. That's 10 000 numbers, twice number for the erasable memory dump. If it's not reading 10 000, then we'll ask you to make it read 10 000 by going VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER, 333 ENTER, 10 000 ENTER. After you've done that, the dump VERB is VERB 74 ENTER, and that will automatically dump the total erasable memory twice, and return you to the proper configuration.
Okay. The procedure will be VERB 01 NOUN 01 ENTER, 333 ENTER, and read out register 1. Then 10 000 - the memory - the computer will then dump the memory twice as properly configured. If not, we have to load in 10 000, and we do that by going VERB 21 NOUN 01 ENTER, 333 ENTER, 10 000 ENTER, and VERB 74 ENTER. Now if register 1 does read 10 000, then we'll still have to do the VERB 74 ENTER, is that correct?
That's affirmative. That VERB 74 ENTER is what starts the dump. Then we just prior to that want to make sure we got 10 000; we made sure. And just hang loose one on Goldstone down here; we're getting it configured.
Roger. You need the high gain, Mike?
Negative. We won't need the high gain.
Apollo 8, Houston. Goldstone is all ready, and you can go ahead with that procedure, Jim.
Roger.
Okay. Register 1 reads 10 000.
Okay. Thank you.
And do you want VERB 74 now?
That's fine.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Have you done the VERB 74 ENTER yet?
No, I'm waiting for your command.
Okay. I'm sorry; you must have missed it. You can go ahead right now, Jim; we're all set.
Roger. VERB 74.
On its way down.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Jim, the dump is complete. You can go ahead and do whatever you like with your computer now.
Roger.
We're going to be restricted to P23 for a while.
Just don't let Anders touch the computer.
I haven't yet, and I don't plan to.
Roger. We concur with that decision.
Oh, we've just been honored by the presence of Mr. Neil Armstrong who is now standing by the CAP COM console, alert and eager.
Roger. Ask him how the stock market is doing.
Tears are rolling down his face.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
With the computer, we sort of got behind in our promise of music. Do you still want it?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Just so Neil doesn't accompany it.
... choir.
Neil says you're in luck; he has a cold today.
(Music of "Joy to the World" and a choir singing another song)
Must be the wrong speed.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger, Mike. That's real nice, but if you don't mind, you'd better hold it off until we get this tracking test done. ...
Roger, Bill. We concur.
Sounds like it is being run at the wrong speed.
It doesn't sound very good to us either.
Coming through nicely, though, Mike. You're coming through nicely, Mike; maybe you could just sing a little bit.
Yes, I'll get my harmonica.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger, Mike. How are our temperatures looking across the service module? Could it be GO here for a shoot in another couple sets on this next start?
Yes. I'm monitoring them, and they look real good to me, Bill. Just a second and I will check with the experts. Yes, you are just fine, Bill, on your quad temps.
And SPS is okay?
Affirmative. SPS is looking good also.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Mike.
Roger, Bill. Because of this W-matrix thing, we would like to add some more star sightings when Jim gets through with the series that he is currently on. And I have the information relevant to them when you are ready to copy.
Stand by.
Go ahead.
Okay. This is - we would like him to do them, as I say, whenever he is through the series he is on now, and they are the same ones that are printed on your flight plan page 2-86. The first one we'd like to increase to two sets; the second one we'd like to increase to two sets, making a total of five sets on those stars on page 2-86. Do you copy?
Roger.
Okay. The other change is on an elapsed time of 120 - a hundred and twenty hours: we'd like to increase that P23 work, the first star change, from one set to two sets. The second star from one to two - -
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Okay.
Okay. Looking for the page; I got it now.
Okay. The first star, make two sets; second star, two sets; for a total of five sets.
Okay.
And if you're in a copying mood, I have - would you believe - a couple of changes to your entry checklist which I'd like to read up to you sometime today or tomorrow.
Okay. Why don't we get them here after this one set of stars.
Very good.
Roger, Bill. I was just given a new one here. While you've got your flight plan out, this would be 130 hours GET. Have you got that page?
I just put it away, but I'll get it out again.
I'm sorry about that.
... if you want me.
Roger. At 130 hours GET, star 02: Where it is printed two sets, we'd like to make that only one set; and then we would like to add star 11 (star one - one) lunar far horizon, two sets. Over.
Okay.
Hey, Mike. Is MIT slipping in the back door?
Not really, Jim. It has to do with this W-matrix. You remember that we reinitialized it in lunar orbit, and then we worked on it as you came back on the previous sightings you made, and now we've gone and reinitialized it again at this point. And we'd like to restore it to its former size and shape and whatnot.
Okay. I understand.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Jim.
Mike, I have got the entry checklist right now. You want to give me an update?
Okay, Bill. Thank you. The first one is on page E-7.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay, Mike. Ready to go. Now I know why Neil was over there.
No. You can't blame it on him. Page E-7 under CM RCS preheat, halfway down where it says "UP TELEMETRY BLOCK" - Are you with me?
I am with you.
Okay. After UP TELEMETRY BLOCK, insert "RCS CM heaters circuit breakers to CLOSE."
Okay.
All they are doing there is just making sure you get your heater circuit breakers closed. The next one is on page E-9.
Ready to copy.
Roger. On E-9 up near the top under "terminate CM RCS preheat" and the middle there, after "CM RCS heaters OFF, LMP confirm," insert "RCS CM heaters circuit breakers to OPEN." That's just opening those two breakers back up.
Roger.
And the last change is on page 14.
Okay.
Yes. This one should be a favorite of yours. Near the top where it says "tape recorder, RECORD FORWARD"- Are you with me?
Roger.
Insert between "tape recorder" and "RECORD FORWARD," insert "COMMAND RESET high bit rate." Over.
Okay. We got them.
Thank you, Bill. That's all.
Okay, Michael.
How is it going? Do you want any systems dope?
Yes, they are hanging together. I haven't even looked at them for the last half hour. I have been over here in the sun.
Yes, they sure are, Bill. They can get you any specific numbers, whatnot, if you're interested.
Well, I hate to say I wasn't interested, but I don't need any specific numbers right now.
Okay. Very good. We concur.
That's an outer space first.
On second thought, how's the evaporator outlet TEMP doing?
Forty-six degrees, Bill.
Cancel that outer space first.
Roger.
How's Magellan coming along?
I am getting a crossed eye looking at this thing. Hey, Mike, just as a matter of interest, I have been just looking at the earth the last hour and a half and there are two tremendous storms down there. I am not sure just where they are, but the vortices are huge.
Roger. Understand.
That's your first space weather report at the manned weather forecast from space, and he's not so sure where it's raining, but it is raining somewhere.
Roger - -
I'd also like to point out that Magellan is not a good analogy. I would also like to point out that Magellan is not a good analogy. I don't think he made it around.
Very good.
How about Alford Chitister?
Roger. Alf.
I don't know how much detail you can see, Jim, but your subspacecraft point is out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean about halfway between Australia and South America.
Roger. The next time I take a look, I'll see what I - we are maneuver to the moon now. We'll see if we can see our shadow.
Seriously, has anyone been able to see the spacecraft from earth? Optically?
We don't think so, Bill. We haven't been able to confirm that they have.
Okay.
You are coming right down the center line of the airways. If you see the airliners going the other way, you better move over.
That's the first time old Lovell's been on track for a long time.
Roger.
Mike, an interesting viewpoint of the NAV sightings: maneuvering with the minimum impulse controller on the way home is a lot more difficult than going out because of all the fuel we don't have now. Every little pulse really moves the spacecraft around.
Roger. Understand. You have too much control for you.
Now, yes.
Let Bruce beware.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Howdy, Jim. Dick Underwood is over here. They're getting their film processing all prepared for your film when you get back and tentatively, can you give us some idea of how much you exposed?
Let me - - let me introduce you to the great film man. He will tell you all about it.
Thank you.
Tell him I hope he can account for haze through the windows. We - on our departure from the moon, we tried to burn up as much as - much of what we had left over, which was quite a bit, and tell him I hope he can develop the high-speed film taken at normal film settings.
Roger. Understand you used just about everything and a lot of the high speed; you used it to normal setting.
Roger. We got it in the wrong bucket there a couple of times.
Okay.
We never did have a chance to do any night earthshine stuff.
Say again about the earthshine, Bill.
We never did have a chance to do any earthshine photography.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, Houston. How are you coming along with your P23 marks?
My eyeballs are getting square. That's what we have been doing most of the day, Ken. Are you receiving the data down below?
Roger. Looks like you are getting some pretty good marks. We have a pretty good hack on the vector and the matrix, and looks like if you wanted to terminate at this point, that we do have good data.
Sounds good. I'll terminate after this - -
Roger.
- - trying to do star 01 again.
Roger.
Ken, did you have a nice Christmas?
Apollo 8, Houston. Did you call?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Who is this, Ken or Jerry?
Say again, please.
This Ken?
Here's Ken. Go ahead.
Okay, Ken. We are getting back to the PTC attitude. Would you like us to do this high-gain REACQ test now on the first roll?
Affirmative.
Okay. Look, how about if I just went to REACQ right now?
Matter of fact I'm in REACQ. If you want me to stay here, why we'll just press on.
Okay, Apollo 8. That is fine.
I guess this step about stopping in roll 150 really doesn't matter too much then.
That's right, Bill. That was just to let you acquire.
Man, we can acquire on the run here.
Hey, you are getting good at that.
That's all they'll let me do.
Okay. We will keep it here for two REV's, Ken. Frank and - Frank and Jim are asleep, and ... so I'll just keep it going here for two rolls.
Okay. Real fine.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, 8.
Go ahead, 8.
Well, the REACQ didn't work as advertised. It looked like it went on by the scan limit and into the mechanical limit and followed MSFN around looking, out of the corner of its eye on WIDE BEAM. And when MSFN came back underneath the spacecraft, why it snapped back on it to NARROW BEAM. It apparently never broke lock; or if it did, it was only instantaneously.
Roger. It looked like we did break lock there for about 8 minutes.
Well, we might have broken two way lock, but I was still having about AGC right at the noise level, at the minimum reception level.
Roger.
When we get out here in the clear zone, when we're definitely out of the scan limit, why, I'll go ahead and go to the MANUAL and AUTO lock-on sequence and switch over to REACQ and see what it does next time around.
Roger.
Houston. Were you able to get high bit rate from the OMNI's now, by the way?
Apollo 8, Houston. The OMNI high bit rate capability is noisy, but usable.
Okay. I think what we'll do here is, if I see the high gain definitely going past the scan limit before it gets the mechanical limit, I'll go ahead and ask - you could ask if the REACQ feature hasn't taken over I'll just go ahead and shut it down so that it'll remain in stops.
How's that sound?
We are talking about it now, Bill.
Okay. It's my understanding that the scan warning limit of this thing is supposed to stop tracking; and break of lock, it'll travel on over to the thumb-wheel settings.
Roger. That's my understanding, Bill. We are talking about it right now. I'll let you know in just a second.
Probably, Ken, we are not ever losing the earth's present signal.
That's correct.
Hey, Bill, can you tell us what angles this went through? The curve that we have plotted is apparently the RF limit rather than the mechanical limit; and discussing the function of the AUTO REACQ mode, it looks like it is supposed to shift when it hits the RF limit, which is your - should be your ENTER set of numbers as opposed to the scan warning limit. And if it went inside of that number, could you tell us about what kind of numbers it did go to?
Roger. It went past the caution warning limit to the scan or RF limit, as I understand it. And let me give you a rundown on what it did here.
Okay. Say it slow so I can copy it.
Okay. The antenna went to about 330 to 270 yaw, plus 60 to 80 pitch. Copy?
Roger.
Okay. The AGC dropped off to what I call our noise level, that was the voltage level on the AGC measured at - integrated when the noise broke in. It was about 11 o'clock position on the gage, and it looked like it was switching beam widths there off and on. It would pulse up and down, and a couple of times dropped to full-scale low very briefly.
Okay. You got some marks on that AGC that should register in volts, I believe. Do you have an indication other than 11 o'clock?
Unfortunately, the numbers never got on here. If you will look on that chart that Fred Haise has, it shows one at 11 o'clock position which is the noise level. I don't remember what the voltage was. I might have it on my systems book, though.
Bill, - -
When the antenna - when the antenna did snap back in, it went to yaw 60, pitch minus 5, with VERB 64 reading plus 67 for yaw and minus 10 for pitch.
Okay. Yes, copy all that. I think you have four or five marks on that power meter, don't you? From what you are saying, I take it, it's between marks 2 and 4.
Yes. Stand by a second.
Stand by, Ken. I'll tell you what that mode is.
Thank you.
Okay. It went to about - hovering around 2.4 to 3 volts.
Okay. Thank you.
Closer to 2.4.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. It's not real clear that it did, in fact, get to the mechanical stop, and if it does, the back room people say we can stay up against that stop for a maximum of 15 minutes without doing any damage. And we would kind of like to track it through one more time as is. We do have the high bit rate capability on OMNI's. So we would like to follow through that same configuration for one more REV.
Stand by.
Well, since we are not sure that it did get up against the mechanical stop last time for 10 minutes or so, I don't think it would be too smart to do it this time because we may end up having to switch field to high gain position.
I am sorry, Bill. You didn't come through. Say again, please.
Since we are not - it is not clear to me that we weren't up against mechanical stops for a while on the last time around. That might account for 10 minutes of that 15 minutes, and there is no sense pushing our luck. I think we ought to - if it starts dropping off again, we just ought to go and put it back into MANUAL and take it back where it belongs. We are still a long way from home, and if that antenna switch fails, it's going to fail the high-gain position, and that's all we got.
Roger, Bill. And we will be making a handoff on stations at 5:5.
Okay.
Ken, we are going to switch COMM carriers here a second.
Okay, thank you.
Belay that. We'll hold this configuration for a while.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Roger. Read you five-by.
Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
It did the same thing that time, Ken. This time the voltage AGC did drop to full-scale low for several seconds, but the antenna does seem to have the capabilities to look right through the spacecraft, and I guarantee, the earth went where the antenna was not supposed to be able to go.
Okay. I would just like to confirm with you that it never did go back to the present numbers.
No, it apparently never lost earth presence signal. It sounds like it was trying to pick up one-way lock all the time, and we usually hovered around 2-volts AGC except for brief periods.
Okay. Thank you very much.
It looks like if they had - should have not had the ... switch into WIDE BEAM until after it had gone to those preset limits.
We are back in AUTO on the OMNI.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, CDR is up and manning the helms. We are going to switch COMM carriers. We'll be off the air for a little bit.
Okay. Thank you.
Hey, Ken. This is Frank.
Good morning, sir.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8. Loud and clear.
How far are we from home, Ken?
Oh, about 152, looks like. That's pretty gross; I get you a real number in just a minute.
152?
148 550; that's a good number.
Very good.
And your velocity is about 4650.
Increasing, huh?
That's affirm.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
We are trying to get back on our normal sleep cycle, and I just woke up here a little while ago, so I'm going to try to hit the hay again. It'd probably be a good idea to try another Seconal to try to get with it. What do you guys think down there?
Okay. Sounds like a good idea, and if we can get Frank to tell us how much sack time he got, why that'll go in the log, too.
I was in bed for 7 hours, Ken, and I probably slept for about 4-1/2 to 5 hours of it, anyway.
You're getting better. Good.
If you - if you're interested in further reports, we've all had three meals today, and we have drunk a lot of water, and Jim's asleep now. He worked pretty hard this afternoon, but I think we are all in pretty good shape now.
Real fine. Thank you.
Used the exerciser.
Well, Ken, that just leaves you or I - how about you and I - did anything exciting happen today?
I think you know about all the things that are exciting up on your end, and it's real quiet down here. Everybody is smiling; Santa was good to most of the folks in the world, and everything is pretty calm, like it should be on Christmas.
very good.
Milt says we're in a period of relaxed vigilance.
Very good.
We'll relax; you be vigilant.
That's a fair trade. (Laughter)
Hey, Ken, has anybody got any good idea why that quad A tank is running hot, hotter than the rest by so much?
Okay. I didn't have an answer when I came on; just a second and we'll check again.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Apollo 8. Let me tell you what the subjects are that we're going over down here: number one, we're making a review of all the entry procedures and this type of information, and we're going to actually go through and review the entry checklist. We have people that are still working on verification of your erasable memory, and we are looking at the EMS problem, and we're discussing the quad temperature, so I'll feed up some of these pieces of information as they come along, and right now we are just sort of having a status review.
I don't think the EMS is much of a problem; it just jumps when you go into AUTO. I don't believe it will bother us for entry. I - I'm doing the same thing; I am looking over my entry checklist. One of the first things I see here is a coldsoak, and I don't think we want to evaporate between the last midcourse and entry, do we?
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Looking at the flight plan, you have a P52 coming up at a 115 hours, and we'll have to do another one at 119:45 in preparation for the P23. And it's acceptable with the ground procedures if you would like to delay about 115-hour alignment, and do it just once at 119:45, or you can do it there in flight plan location. If you want to skip the 115-hour alignment we could go ahead and start in on the pitch and yaw free PTC mode at this time.
What does that mean, Ken?
Okay. We have a DTO that requires that we do a PTC and go ahead and do it in minimum impulse mode so that we're not putting any attitude hold corrections in. And we're going to be tracking the attitude excursion, and they want this some - think like 6 hours - or until we reach a limit.
Okay.
Cabin's running a little bit warmer today than normal.
I'm sorry; say it again.
I say the cabin is running a little bit hotter today than it has been. It looks like this particular PTC alignment gets more sun in the cabin than the PTC before.
Roger. What kind of temperature are you recording now?
About 78.
I just put the window shades up. That'll cool it down.
Okay.
Do you want me to take the pitch yaw out of RATE COMMAND, right?
That's affirmative. You just put it MINIMUM IMPULSE, and then we'll watch it.
There you are.
Okay. Thank you.
Have fun.
Roger. And on that quad temperature - the upper limit of that thing is 105 degrees on the bottle. You are well below that. We have been watching it, and it is tracking, although it is tracking very slowly. As you roll the spacecraft, the temperature excursions seem to be a little sluggish, but it isn't a frozen sensor. And talking a little bit more about that one right now, you might tell Jim the next time he goes to work with the optics, when he works with the trunnion, if he'll go ahead and recycle the ZERO OPTICS switch, he can avoid the problem we had prior to midcourse correction 4.
We've done that. And the midcourse correction 4.
Roger.
The midcourse correction number 6 right now looks like zero, and midcourse correction number 7 is approximately 2 feet per second.
Okay, Jim. Now we've got on the checklist to initiate cabin coldsoak. This involves evaporating, and I don't think we want to do that.
Okay. Now we talked that over with FIDO, and at 12 hours out, everyone seems to think that we don't need to do it there. But in close, it doesn't seem to have any effect on the trajectory, and what's been suggested if you'd like - we can do over the entry checklist and just kind of walk through it on the air with all the people on the console. Right now, you have the team that will be performing the entry session with you so we can go over the checklist and run down any questions that you might have. That's up to you.
That's fine. Let's do that. I've got one right here. I'm lonesome anyway.
Okay. Give us a few minutes to pull ourselves together and get on the air.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We've drifted off now about 25 degrees in pitch. I'd like to have you take it back and set up the PTC plane again at pitch of 10 and yaw 45 and set up the PTC under control, and turn your pitch back to minimum impulse. And give us a mark when you have done that, and we'll time the drift rates down here.
Okay.
Okay, Ken. I've got them all damped out about as low as I can get them.
Okay. Fine.
I'll put in a roll right now.
Thank you.
It takes me three actuations to get about - just about a degree and a half, or a tenth of a de - 0.15 degrees per second.
Okay. And give a mark when you release the RATE COMMAND in pitch and yaw.
I haven't even got them on.
Oh, okay. Fine.
When I gave you - when I gave you that mark, that was it.
Real fine. Thank you.
It's much more sensitive today than it was when it was heavy.
Roger.
Well, the old earth is getting bigger.
Good show. Going in the right direction, then.
Yes. I was beginning to get worried.
Ken, be sure and call me if you see the gimbal angles start to get near gimbal lock or anything. I'm a little drowsy still. I don't want to end up with another null attitude, like one is enough.
Roger. Will do.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Ken.
Okay. Would you reinitialize the PTC attitude, and let's try that one more time.
Okay.
You ready?
Okay.
Okay. Three blips.
Thank you.
There she goes.
Roger.
Is it sleepy out down there, too?
Say again, please.
I say, is it sleepy out down there?
Roger. It's getting pretty good now. I figure it's getting sleepy up there, though.
Yes.
Okay. Well would you believe that the North beat the South 3 to nothing, and they did that all with a first-quarter field goal.
Very good. When was the East-West game?
Oh, about Saturday.
Next Saturday?
Yes, sir.
And, Frank, we are going over the checklist right now, and I'll get back with you on the entry checklist in a few minutes.
Okay, Ken. I think it is a pretty good one; that's one thing we have practiced a lot. But we might as well let everybody know what we're doing.
Roger.
Ken, while we are just killing time here, there are a couple of anomalies we've noticed. The booties, you know, for the inflight coveralls; mine have frayed very badly, and I had to take them off. Also, we had one Y adapter with an open in it, and the lightweight headsets were kind of useless.
Roger.
I take that back. I really didn't mean to say that. The lightweight headset - what I really meant to say was - the lightweight headsets are useless.
Okay.
But these Snoopy hats are pretty comfortable. We have worn them the whole time.
Ken, one thing we are going to do on these suits, we're going to Stow them one under each seat, the way North American suggested.
Roger. And you'll be putting the helmets in the food stowage.
Yes, I think we'll put the helmets in the food stowage; and any stuff we have to take out of there, we'll just stick in a suit.
Okay.
Is the weather still good out there?
It's not quite as clear as it was yesterday; it sure is nice and balmy.
No, I mean out at 165 west.
Okay. Frank, we've got a weather picture here. The forecast shows 2000 scattered and 4000 broken with a high overcast. You might see that as you come down through it, and wave heights 4 feet, wind about 070 at 12 with 10 miles visibility and perhaps some scattered showers in the area, and this is forecast for the twenty-seventh at 16:00 Zulu.
Very good; we'll be there.
Yes, I'm sure you will.
I don't think those waves are too high. We're going to have to sit in this heap for about 45 minutes.
Okay. We'll put in a kit for some small waves.
Tell Jerry Hammack if the waves get high, it's his fault.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. Why don't you drive it back over to the PTC attitude and put it back in ATTITUDE HOLD for the roll, and we're going back in and review the DTO requirement. You have about the same results, it looks like, on a cursory analysis all three times. So we're going to take another look and see if there is any reason to do it again. If so, we'll call you. You can go ahead and put it back in ATTITUDE HOLD now.
Okay, Jim. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Radio check.
Loud and clear, Apollo 8.
Okay, Ken. Thank you.
Roger. It is taking us a little longer to go through and rehash all of the entry checklist than I though, and we are just about to wrap it up now.
No problem. Just watch my gimbal angles for me, and give me a call if they get too close.
Roger. We will watch them.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
We would like to look at a couple more ΔV|DELTA-V tests on the EMS, and the general consensus is that we don't think there is any particular problem. We'd like to go ahead and take a look at what you get by running four or five more ΔV|DELTA-V tests. And prior to that, we'd like to run one of these null bias tests; and since we don't have any way of monitoring any of this stuff on the downlink, I'd like to have you tell us each step when you turn the switch and different orders and things like that.
Okay.
Alright. I'll run a test.
Okay. The first thing we want is this null bias, 100 seconds.
You stand by, and I'll do a null bias for 100 seconds. Do you want me to put ΔV|DELTA-V in AUTOMATIC and let it alone for 100 seconds?
That is affirmed.
Going to ΔV|DELTA-V; going to AUTO -
Now.
Roger.
Went to one-tenth and back to zero.
Understand; plus one-tenth and back to zero.
One-tenth, now it's a minus one-tenth and back to zero; no, it's not zero yet; wait a minute.
Now it's up some, minus 4; 0.4, that is.
Roger.
Minus 25.
Roger.
Minus 26.
Minus 0.7, and there is 100 seconds; minus 0.7 at 100 seconds.
Roger.
Now what do you want?
Okay. If we go back to mode, switch to stand by and FUNCTION switch OFF.
Roger.
Okay. Now we'd like to do a couple of ΔV|DELTA-V self-tests.
Okay. 71586.8.
Roger.
Say you're going AUTOMATIC?
Roger.
Going to a ΔV|DELTA-V test now. Counting down.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
You back, Ken?
Apollo 8, this is Houston.
Roger. Read you.
Okay. We got caught in a station handover there. I didn't copy anything after you said you were putting it to ΔV|DELTA-V test.
I ran - I ran three tests during that handover. Two over minus 19.6 - two of them are minus 19.8; and one of them, minus 19.6.
Okay. That sounds real fine.
Roger.
Okay. The other thing that - sometime prior to entry - and we're going to be looking at it - is the normal entry test pattern, and it's called out presently in the checklist as something we do around an hour. And we'd like to check if you can read the number on the scroll that is up now so we can see where we are in the test test pattern sequence. We're considering taking a look at one of these test patterns before we get into an hour so we can have more time to think about it in the event that there should be something anomalous in it.
Why don't we do it right now? We're on number 8.
Okay. Understand; that's number 8, right?
Roger. It takes an awful long time to run them over there anyway. It won't hurt to do one.
Okay. If you'll stand by just a second; we're checking to see where we stand in the sequence of events for on pattern 8.
Hey, Ken.
Yes, sir.
Another little thing about this EMS: you know, we had it set up when we separated from the booster - -
Roger.
-- and the shock of the separation - the shock of the pyro's blowing in separation knocked it up to 100 and something.
Understand. Knocked it up to 100.
Roger.
Was the pyro separation enough that the - you felt a sensable g in the bird?
Roger. Let's just say there wasn't any question we were separating.
Roger. Understand.
While you are checking the scroll, find out which entry pattern I should be using this bird in.
Okay. Will do.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. While we are verifying that scroll position - they are talking it over in the back room about that now - I would like to go ahead and run down the checklist with you for entry.
Go ahead.
Okay. Looking on entry 1: the second item there is the 12-hour Kelvin cold soak, and in discussions I here and preflight, I think it is agreed that we don't want to do the cold soak there. So we are going to delete that step 2. And what it amounts to is, I think we do want to do a cold soak, and we certainly want to exercise the water boilers prior to entry in order to insure that we don't have one that is dried out, in the same manner that we had one dried out prior to LOI. And we are working on some procedures for that, and we'll have to come back to you with those a little bit later, and we will try to do it sometime when Bill's on the line so that everybody can get in on the loop at the same time. We would like to add a step between 8 and 9, or as part of step 8. This is all on page E-1, where we turn the VHF to Simplex A at minus 4 hours and 35 minutes. Now this will be beyond two-way VHF range, but it will make sure that we do have it on at the time when we pick it up. We were able to get out to 20 000 miles with a downlink, and we are checking on the uplink signal. So if we put it on at this point, we know we have it on well in advance of any time we might be able to get into the VHF.
Okay.
Okay. I guess maybe I have that backwards. They copy - you folks copied the VHF out to 20 KM. We're checking on the - on the downlink into that now. But in any event, this 4 hours and 35 minutes will get it well in advance of that.
Roger.
Okay, 8. We just got an answer back on the test patterns. We thought it was - We had 25 test patterns which are allocated to ground test, and these are the ones we've been looking at. Then there are five more that are allocated to flight, and the only difference in these patterns is that the flight patterns have instructions actually written on them; so if we are looking at test pattern 8, that means that we're still working on the ones that were allocated to the ground test, so there was no problem there. And I'll get you a number for which pattern we should be using for entry; working on that one right now. So we would like to go ahead and run through these.
I don't mean the - -
Say again, Frank.
I don't mean the test pattern. I say, I don't mean the test pattern. We asked them to put the supercircular on the number, the first place on the scroll; I'm sure they did. I'm sure it's the first pattern, but I just wanted to make sure that's right.
Roger. That's why we are trying to verify. So - -
You want me to run through a test pattern?
Yes, sir. If you would, please. And if you'd tell us each step as you go through it.
Okay. Going through step 1; EMS test 1: wait 5 seconds. There's 5 seconds. Going AUTO. Okay- Indicator lights are all OFF; the range is zero, zero. Now I'm gonna slew the hairline over the notch. Okay. And now we go in EMS test 2.
Roger.
Got the 0.05g light; all others are out.
Roger.
Go on test 3: far side lower light on 10 seconds; going to set the range counter to 58. Okay. Set at 58; going to test 4.
Roger.
Beautiful. It's perfect. It's right in the corridor. It comes down and stops at zero, zero.
Very good.
Go in test 5: perfect again. Okay. Now I go to range set.
Okay.
In STANDBY.
Okay.
Okay. That was perfect.
Real fine.
Okay, Apollo 8. I'd like to run one more null bias and looks like we will have exercised everything we can get to.
Okay. ΔV|DELTA-V AUTO, all zeros.
Minus 2.
Roger. Understand minus 2. Alright. Is that minus 2 or minus two-tenths?
Two-tenths, three-tenths now.
Okay. Real good. That looks like we - -
It looks like we had a lot of noise on the circuit for a while there, Ken.
Yes, we did, too; all those electronic glitches I guess.
Okay. One hundred seconds, it's plus - minus four-tenths.
Okay. Real fine. That looks like that's about all of the functions that we can check, and looks like everything is just down the line.
Roger.
Okay. We still owe you confirmation that you can expect your high speed scroll to be the first pattern you come to, and I'll let you know as soon as they come in with an answer on it.
Okay.
I'd like to go ahead and finish going through the entry book if you're ready.
Roger.
Okay. We've reviewed most of the book up here, and we will have to come back and suggest a way that we can check out the water boiler prior to getting reentry area. We've reviewed all of the last minutes changes that were put in - pen and ink type things - and they're all looking good. On page E-7, like to add a couple of items.
What's that?
Okay. On step 34 under final stowage, which is a sort of catch-all area, there's a step that says secondary glycol to radiator, and it says bypass, verify. While we are down in this area, we would like to go to panel 382, the water control panel, and set up the evaporator water control valve both primary and secondary to AUTO. Now this is something we would have done had we done the cold soak at minus 12 hours, but since we weren't doing it there, we would like to go ahead and make sure we have these in AUTO, and this will enable automatic controls from the panel.
Can we just make this part of the procedure when we test out the water boilers beforehand?
Yes, sir. If we get that checked out earlier, we can just leave them in AUTO.
I'd rather do that.
Okay. I'm just going to make a note here, and we can do it the other way, too. The other item that was pen-and-inked in - -
...
You may already have this down as step 35. It says UP TELEMETRY to BLOCK, VERIFY, and there's a step right after that that says RCS command module heaters to circuit breakers CLOSED.
Roger.
Okay.
I have that.
Okay. I guess that one was sent up to you this afternoon. And when you turn the page over to E-8, it shows the EMS entry check being run at minus an hour, and you know that it's a short test. There is really no reason to wait for an hour; we might as well go ahead and do that as soon as you get through with step 35 on page E-7 because we're coming up on a pretty busy period.
I say that's fine; we'll do that.
Houston, are you still there?
Roger. We got a discussion going; be right back.
Okay, Apollo 8. On page E-9 - -
Okay.
- - at the top of the page, you have step 38, and right underneath that, prior to step 39, we want to have a primary glycol loop activation. What we are doing is to get the glycol evaporator water switch to AUTO and the glycol evaporator steam pressure switched to AUTO. This will get your primary water boiler on the line prior to entry, or at least it'll enable it.
Okay. Tell me what to write in, Ken.
Okay. It's glycol evaporator water to AUTO.
Apollo 8, Houston. Are you there?
Glycol evaporator water switch to AUTO.
Okay. And the second switch is the glycol evaporator steam pressure to AUTO.
Okay.
Okay. That takes care of getting the primary water boiler enabled, and it's my understanding that we were going to make the actual entry with both the primary and the secondary water boilers on the line.
I'm not reading you now, Houston.
Roger. How now?
Loud and clear.
Okay. There's some question from reading the checklist. It is my understanding that both the primary and the secondary water boilers will be ON for the actual entry, and don't find a place in the checklist where it's actually turned on. So we'd like to get confirmation on that, and we'll make sure that we have all the proper switching to put in the checklist.
Okay.
Alright. Still on page E-9 and under step 39 at the bottom of the pyro circuit check, there's a step that says panel 8, all circuit breakers CLOSED except and then it lists five that are printed, one that was pen-and-inked before launch. It says EDS power circuit breakers 3 OPEN, and to be complete, we ought to add the RCS heater circuit breakers. There's two of those, and they should also be OPEN.
Okay.
Alright. The rest of these pages look good; I'm coming over through the graphs. And on page E-11 - -
Roger. I'm with you.
Okay. On step 5 on E-11, there's - the first subtitle there is Helmets and Gloves, and the items that follow beneath that are affected by whether you wear suits or come in shirt sleeves, but they do have to be accomplished. And the suit return air valves would actually be OPEN for a shirt-sleeve entry. And you should have a line penciled in of optics power to OFF between an emergency cabin pressure valve and the time when the CMP moves to the couch.
Right.
Okay. And the step shows the tape recorder to REWIND at minus 30. Now that's an onboard step rather than a ground step, just to verify that.
Okay.
Okay. Under step 6, almost at the bottom - in fact, it's three lines from the bottom of step 6 - there's a section that says secondary coolant loop evaporator to RESET, and should be a note that that's 58 seconds if you hold it in RESET prior to moving the pump OFF.
That's it; that's in it.
Okay. Okay. The next comment is on page E-13.
Okay. I'm there.
Alright. This is a general comment that refers to any time you're working around P62 or when you're going between P62 and P63, and you should be careful not to call an extended VERB during this time. This is here in the program notes, and it is just a reminder. What will happen if we get into an extended VERB such as an VERB 83|83 or an VERB 82|82? We may get hung-up in P62 and have to recycle through it in order to get the 63, and neither of these displays are normally used, and it's just a good practice. And we're just trying to remind you that we don't want to call an extended VERB while we're in P62.
Okay. Neither do we. That's right.
Okay.
Okay. In going through the rest of it, we didn't find any other things to make comments on. You have all the latest corrections in your checklist.
Roger. The main thing, that is to come up with a way to determine that the boiler - water boiler is not dry and make sure that Bill gets it activated at TMS 7.
That is correct, and we will talk to you some more about that next time we catch both you and Bill up.
Righto.
Ken, this is Frank. I am going to be off the headset for about 5 minutes here.
Okay. Fine. When you come back, I will have a systems rundown for you.
Fine.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Okay. Loud and clear.
Back with you.
Okay. I've got a few good words for you. The erasable memory has been taken completely apart and looked at, and it looks like it's all okay. Your P01 didn't have any effect. The one thing that might be questionable is if you used a VERB 67 when you get to the NOUN 99 display, you may find that one to be unreliable, and what you're going to get there is the - that's an error display for the W-matrix. And it's something you probably won't be using again anyhow; and if the occasion arises, we can update that one, but it's not a normally used display and everything else, all the operational functions, are good.
Very good.
Okay. As of 114 hours, your batteries - you had battery A with 39.32 amp-hours, battery B had 35.21, and battery C 38.46. Your cryo quantities remaining at SEP were the same we gave you the last time, 180 pounds of oxygen per tank and 11 pounds of hydrogen per tank. At present, the service module RCS, using the computer values for the quantities, you have quad A with 45 percent, Bravo with 50, Charlie with 58, and Delta at 48. What we plan to do with the secondary tanks is to go ahead and turn them on at 37 percent actual, and in the event of lost COMM or something like that, recommend that you use 50 percent onboard gaging as being the time to turn the secondary propellants on. However, as long as we can use our own calculations, why, we might as well leave them tied up. We probably won't get into the secondary propellants prior to entry anyhow.
Roger.
Okay. A couple of items I want to check up on: I'd like to confirm that the hatch Dog will be taken off while you're on the chutes if you can. If not, you're going to do that in the water. Is that affirm?
...
Okay. Now we've got a little better signal. Like to confirm that the hatch clamps on the side hatch will be taken off either on the chutes or in the water, whichever you can get to. Is that affirm?
Roger. That's affirm. As a matter of fact, we didn't even put - didn't even put them on.
Okay. Do you plan to put them on for an entry?
I don't think so. It's held pretty well so far. I don't think - everybody tells me it wouldn't help much anyway.
Okay. And we realize we never did find out what happened to the Mae West. Did you leave it blown up, or did you dump it?
We dumped it.
Okay. Who was the lucky guy?
The same guy that tried to launch us this afternoon again.
Okay. And just as a gee whiz item: you're now a 137 915 out, and you've only accelerated the 4883. You might check to make sure you don't have a speed brake hanging.
Uh-oh.
Those are nominal values.
Roger. 137 000 miles out, huh?
That's affirm.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Loud and clear.
Good morning, or good afternoon, or whatever it is. The JOD is back at the CON; CDR went back to bed.
Okay.
Looks like all the junior guys have the midwatch.
I know what you mean. I had a little sleep earlier, so I am pretty well rested and want to make sure Frank gets a good snooze here prior to entry. This might be a good time to try out your background music, and see if you have any better luck.
Okay. We'll try that a little later.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. I guess we should start off with a little dialogue about sleep. How much did you have?
Well, let's see; whenever it was I told you I went to bed last night till now. Just a second and let me check the flight plan.
Have you got it logged in when it was I asked for that last Seconal?
Okay. I guess we can figure that out for ourselves, can't we?
Yes. Why don't you let me know. I have kind of lost track of time it was when I went to bed. But it was about - I went to sleep about 15 minutes after that and woke up about 10 minutes ago. Good sleep.
Okay. So I see it is now 142 hours.
What do you think I am, Rip van Winkle?
Just trying to find out how soundly you really slept. I guess you are not that sleepy.
. . . but not that.
Okay. It's really about 4 hours, Bill.
Okay. Good.
Apollo 8, Houston. Have you got somebody under the left couch, or could you get down to the water control panel?
I can get down there. Frank hasn't quite gone to sleep yet.
Well, what we were thinking about doing was boiling a little out of the secondary evaporator to check it out, just as a component check, something we need to do; but if there's somebody down there in the way, why, we can do that some other time.
Well, if it boils, we are going to know it before - it won't take long to find out it won't boil. There's not a heck of a lot we can do about it, so why don't we wait until someone else wakes up here, Frank wakes up again. How will that be?
Yes. That would be fine. There is something you can do; you can reservice it. And it is kind of a tedious process, and that's the reason why we just want to kind of keep our eyes on it so we will have some idea prior to entry if we can count on having two loops or one. Which kind of leads us into another question we are trying to pin down, two questions, in fact. Number one, we would like to verify that you do plan to use both primary and secondary boilers during the actual entry, and we are also looking for a way of checking the primary boiler to make sure it isn't dried out prior to entry. And that is turning into a little more of a challenge than you might suspect. If you have any thoughts on that subject, we can go over that.
The answer to the question is yes, we do plan to use both. Before we get into the water boiler pump though, CDR would like to take a Seconal also; make sure he can get off to sleep here.
Okay. That's a GO.
Okay. On the water boiler: it's interesting that I get my own - I was going to say anytime you have our mike keyed, I can hear myself talk with about a 2-second time delay. With respect to the primary and secondary boiler checks, I think that is a good idea to make sure we got them both prior to entry and have the reservicing procedures handy.
Roger, Bill. You know the secondary - well, in fact, both reservicing procedures are available in a malfunction book, and sort of the problem with checking out the primary boiler is finding a way to make it boil on the way in.
Yes. Just a second, I got another little chore going here.
Roger. It looks like the only way we'll be able to do it would be to shut off the radiators.
We were looking for a little more docile way to do that.
Roger. That way would be agreeable to me too, a little more docile way, but they shouldn't freeze up if we did it quickly.
Roger. We are talking over several things, you know, like putting the ten-pin valve to MANUAL or partially closing it or some of these different ideas, and something you can think about while you are laying there with nothing else to do.
Yes. We noticed that it had gotten warmer in the cockpit coming back than it was going out. And I remember going out when we manually positioned the ten-pin valve, but we had pretty good control over the glycol evap outlet temperature. So possibly that would be the thing to attack first rather than the radiators.
Okay. We've got the back room boys looking at it.
I guess if we do pick a time, though, we ought to pick a time that if something did go haywire, we could afford to boil . . . the rest of the way in, but still leave us enough time to fix - rig up the evap service if it didn't work.
That's affirm, and we're factoring in things like trajectory considerations and all that sort of thing, too.
Right. I think that the second derivative of the water boiler versus time plot will give us the optimum time to do it.
EECOM's copying that.
There's also speculation you have a chart on board that gives that information.
Well, if I don't, I'm sure those guys can ship one up. They've shipped up some other pretty good ones.
It's also been suggested that if you don't have the chart it's on the tape recorder.
Well, if I don't have a chart, I'll put it on the tape recorder.
Okay. I think, unless you guys got some more comments along these lines, maybe we ought to give these guys a chance to get to sleep, and I'll recline here for a while. If you've got something to brief me on, well, go ahead; but I'd like to keep my answers to yes's and no's and whatever else you think you really need.
Okay. Fine, Bill, and I'll check with you like every 30 minutes, just to make sure we still have voice contact.
Okay. I've got some log writing to do and whatnot. So keep an eye on the systems and the gimbal angles, and we'll be all right.
Okay.
And, Ken, if your EECOM man wants to play the OMNI-switch game, we're on Dog - Bravo at this time, actually on Bravo but also configured for D's - correction, we are on D and also configured for Bravo. If you want to switch, we'll go ahead.
Okay, we'll give that a try, and we are cranking up some Background music for you.
Okay. The last time they did that, it sounded like they were running at the wrong speed on the tape, but we're a little closer now. Maybe it'll be a little better.
Would you also believe Doppler shift?
Might be another way to range.
Probably it was Doppler shift; we're heading back out again,
Looks like we can use your humming for backup ranging in case everything else fails.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. You don't need to answer this transmission, but doctors observe that it looks like your - some of your sensors may be working loose, so you might just kind of push on them and see if they are in place.
That do any good?
Looks like it is one of your sternals, Bill.
Apollo 8. We can't handle the OMNI switching for about thirty more minutes, till we get back to an 85-foot dish, so you will have to watch the antenna store for a few more minutes.
Okay. I don't see any loose sensor - the upper, upper ...
Are you trying to call, Houston?
No, I didn't. It sounded like you were getting an echo, and I checked, and I hadn't held the key down at the time either.
Okay. I don't see any loose sensors, but the upper sternal is beginning to irritate a little bit, but not badly; and possibly there is something going on there.
Okay. And did you copy about the antenna?
They really disappoint me, but I'll keep that in mind.
(Start music)
Apollo 8, Houston. I'd like to make a voice check with you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.
(End music)
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.
Apollo 8, Houston in the blind now. We're not receiving down-voice. We have data, and it appears it's probably a ground problem.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Read you loud and clear.
Okay. I got you that time. I take it you were able to copy us with the music? Is that affirm?
I was able to copy you all the time, Ken, but I could only hear the music when you were trying to transmit. And I wondered if you noticed cycling on my suit power switch when you - when you called me. I am hearing an echo now.
Roger. I copy your echo. And what switch were you cycling?
I was cycling the suit power which turns off the BIOMED periodically. I figured that would wake the doctors up.
It appears that we have more than one communications problem.
Roger.
Calm it. (Laughter)
You are cutting out, Houston.
Oh, that was an inadvertent cut-in.
Okay.
You need the high gain, Houston, or will the OMNI's be okay?
8, Houston. That's negative. The OMNI is okay.
Roger. Be advised that about 50 - I am hearing these echos quite a bit of the time, and if you are trying to play music, I am not hearing it.
Roger. We understand, and we are not trying to play music right now.
Okay. Who is this, COMM TECH?
Ken is only human. This is his substitute; this is Flight Director.
Oh, I didn't recognize your voice there.
I don't get to talk often.
Who is substituting for you now, Flight?
DFD.
Okay. Things are looking pretty good from here. How about down there?
It couldn't be better.
You guys are doing a great job. I really appreciate it.
Apollo 8, Houston. Going to be handling over sites at 25. I will make a voice check with you when we come up on the new site, and the ground says thank you for your kind words.
Okay. We will be standing by.
Apollo 8, Houston through Honeysuckle.
Roger, Houston. Loud and clear.
Okay, Bill, and our BIOMED data still looks a little bit squirrelly. How about checking the blue signal conditioner on your BIOMED harness. You have one connector, should be the center package, has a blue connector on it. You kind of check that, and I don't know if you have changed the BIOMED harness leads recently; if you have, this might have caused our problem.
Roger. I was just cracking open some acorns here for breakfast. Let me put them down, and I will check my BIOMED leads.
There is no rush on it.
Everything seems shipshape.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go, Houston.
Okay, Bill. We're ready to try this music on a different kind of lash-up this time. What I'd like to do in order to make sure that we maintain voice COMM is when you get it if you would, give us a call and tell us you have the music and any comment about its relative volume or anything like that. And if I get your call, then I'll call you back and tell you. And what will happen is when I go to talk to you we'll drop the music link. And we can go ahead and take over the switching of the antennas if you like.
okay. I'm in Bravo Dog switch configuration, and go ahead with the music. Be advised last time the fidelity was low, and the volume was too high.
Okay. And if you'll give us the same kind of comment, hopefully not the same comment but the same type of evaluation when you pick it up this time.
Play it a little bit, and we'll talk about it.
(Begin music)
I can barely, barely hear it.
Needs to be just a hair louder.
That's good.
That will keep me awake.
Maybe you ought to crank it back down a little bit.
Great.
(End music)
Apollo 8, Houston. How was that?
That's real good for background level type, Ken. Maybe you can do some logging in here so that's real nice at that level; maybe for anything else it could be a little bit louder, but that's good for now.
Okay. That's about the MAX volume we can take down here; so if you want to talk to us, you may have to call us once or twice. You're just barely equaling it.
Okay. Try it again, and I'll give you a little louder call; I've been trying to keep it quiet.
Oh, yes, that's all right. Don't - I was aware you were calling; I just didn't make out what you said. And from now on, any time you call, we'll drop the music, and I'll talk to you.
Roger. Don't hesitate for me a bit.
Right.
And, Bill, we're going to have to wait until we get around to Bravo before we start switching. Our margin is still a little bit low.
Okay. I'll just go ahead and switch it and save you all that trouble.
Okay. Thank you. Our midnight DVA show's back on the air.
Roger.
(Begin music)
Really great now.
Apollo 8, Houston. Check your yaw gimbal angle.
(End music)
You must have been reading my mind.
No, the DSKY's.
Oh, okay.
When you go to high gain, would you tell me?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Ken, do you want me to use the high gain when we come around, or is the OMNI sufficient? It doesn't matter to me.
Okay. The OMNI is doing fine. I was just watching your middle gimbal angle there; it was getting a little far out.
Oh, okay. I thought you - I was, too. I thought you said check the DSKY, and I thought you were talking about the high gain antenna.
No, I'm sorry. I was just watching your middle gimbal.
Yes, this thing really slops around in deadband, but it's really nice flying otherwise.
Glad to hear that.
All I have used the while trip is pulse.
You just woke the doctor up. You said pulse, and he came alive. And he'd like to know if you did in fact, check out the BIOMED harness.
Yes, I tightened down all the plugs and checked all the leads, and everything looked in order. And when the other fellows wake up, if you remind me, why, I'll give it a more thorough going over.
Okay, Bill. It's been suggested that they would like to see you try switching the two leads, you know, a yellow and a blue one, and just go ahead and switch them, and they'll sacrifice their pneumogram because they'd rather have the EKG.
Do they need it now, or can they wait until somebody else wakes up?
I guess we can wait, Bill. Is that a hard thing to get to?
You have to take your pants off and about everything else - stand by.
How's that, Houston?
Okay. Stand by, Bill. We'll take a look at it.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger. Read you. We're looking at data now. (Laughter)
I suppose you'll tell me my heart has quit beating.
We couldn't argue with you. That doesn't help at all. That's pretty bad.
Is the pneumogram NO-GO for entry?
Roger.
One thing you might be interested in: we listened to that low speed information that you taped on the first couple of REV's that we thought was going to be unusable. And it must have been a ground problem because it's coming in loud and clear now.
Hey, that's great. I was just writing a long dissertation on why we have problems and can't use that DSE in low bit rate. So that's real good.
Yes, it's coming in loud and clear. Pretty interesting.
Let me tell you, it was a hectic revolution.
If you've got the music going, I'm not hearing it, Ken.
No, I was waiting to see what we did on that before I started it up again.
Okay. If they could hold off here for a couple of hours, if they have anything at all, just tell them I'm alive, why, I'll give my real good going over here when I get done. I might even make a statement to the world that I haven't noticed that their little amplifiers had gotten hot.
You say it did get hot?
No, I hadn't even noticed it until I started changing the lead.
Oh, okay. Okay. I'm going to crank the music up again then.
Okay. Have they got anything at all down there?
Well, we're on low bit rate right now, so it'll be a few minutes before we get a chance to take another look at it. We'll let you know if you get sick.
Oh, well, we can hold off for a little while.
Roger.
I can't hear it, but it sounds like something I'd rather not hear anyway.
(End of music)
Houston, Apollo 8.
Hello, Apollo 8. We interrupt this program of music to bring you the late evening status report.
Good. What's up?
Okay. We are getting ready to have a shift turnover, and I wanted to go over a few items before I do. On the midcourse correction number 6: right now, that looks like it is at most 0.3 a foot per second, so there will be no burn for midcourse number 6. Midcourse number 7 is a little larger, and we'll make a decision on that later. Your weather in landing site still reported as being good and the forecast to be about 2000 scattered and 12 000 broken, about the same numbers they gave Frank earlier. Visibility will be about 10 miles, wave height about 4 feet. And I guess there is some scattered thundershowers, like less than 5 percent, that you should worry about. And they're 10 to 30 percent maybe at 2000, broken as opposed to scattered; so it looks pretty fair. We have got a - -
Just my kind of weather.
Roger. Got a couple of flight plan things to consider. Now number 1 at 119:30: we have got a P52 IMU realignment which we need to slip in ahead of the P23 sightings, and that will be an option 3 REFSMMAT.
Roger.
Okay. Some of the folks in sitting back and looking at the TV business have some ideas about things they would like to see tried with the filters. And I would like to read you what they have here and let you think about it; and in the next 10 hours, you can decide whether or not you think it is worth the effort. Basically, they would like to try using a whole different series of filters - -
Okay, Ken. I got something to write on. Was that P52 at 18:30 or 19:30?
119:30.
Okay. I'm ready to copy on TV.
Okay. Before you copy, let me read it all through to you here so you will get the feel for what it is we are talking about. The title of this little epistle is "TV and Film Photography Correlation Experiment," and what they want to do is mount the TV camera with the telephoto lens on a bracket. in the rendezvous window and take a TV picture of the earth through the red and blue filters, 1 minute per filter; that means red and blue filters individually. Then they would like to take a TV picture of the earth through through the red, in this case, the 25 Alfa filter combined with the polarizing filter. Rotate the polarizing filter through 360-degree increments, again 1 minute per position. Then they'd like to take a TV picture of the moon with the polarizing filter at 360-degree moon-rotation increments and again, 1 minute per position. And to go with this, we would like to have Hasselblad pictures.
One minute.
Okay. I am standing by.
Are those - when you were talking about pictures through the polarizing filter, is that the TV pictures through the polarizing filter?
That's affirmative. All above was TV.
Okay. Now the only thing - the only problem here is it's darn near impossible to aim that television camera; the field of view is so narrow that it took three men and a boy up here to get the thing pointed in the right direction. And we tried using chewing gum for a sight and everything else, and let me tell you that the odds of getting that thing in the earth is pretty small.
Okay. I think we weren't too clever in our ground callup as to how to point the spacecraft. For one thing I think we can do that a lot better next time now that we have stumbled through it once. I agree with you - -
It's not the spacecraft; it's not the spacecraft that's hard to point, it's the camera. The bracket has sufficient slump in it that it can take the camera out of field of view when configured through the window. And it took a lot of microadjustments with a lot of coaching from the ground to get the thing in, and it was a real tough job. So I think you ought to take all this in mind; if you could possibly use the wide angle, you might be better off.
Okay. I understand what you are saying now. I'll run that back by the TV guys and see what they have to say about that. In conjunction with the above, they wanted to take some Hasselblad pictures of the earth through the rendezvous window with the red and blue filter and black and white film, and then again through the polarizing filter, and this is all going to be used in order to try and correlate the TV and the regular film photography. So if you think it is a worthwhile thing, and you would like to give it a try, I'll run this by Jack and the TV cats and see if they would like to get something out of it with the wide angle, and we can talk about it a little later.
Okay. Another thing to keep in mind is that we haven't seen the moon - we didn't see all the way out, and we rarely see it going back. We have seen it once since we left, but we have maneuvered the wrong way from a sighting attitude to the shortest way to PTC and to go from an earth view to a lunar view will take quite a bit of time and some RCS. So you might keep that in mind, too.
Okay. I just wanted you to be aware of this and think about it and what its implications to the flight plan might be, and I'll run this wide angle and comment about the moon back by and see which sections they think would be most appropriate. Okay. On the EMS scroll, Frank wanted us to verify the order that he could expect to see the entry profile, and the first profile that comes up is labelled "Nonexit Number 2" and that is the short-range high-speed entry. The second thing that will come up is entitled "The 3500 Mile" which is also high-speed entry, but it is the one you would use in event we go to the longer entry ranges. Then the third profile will be "Nonexit Entry Number 1," and it will be followed by a forth 3500 mile. So you have four entry profiles. Numbers 1 and 3, as you come to them, are the short ranges, and numbers 2 and 4 are the long-range scrolls. On coldsoak, I think we talked about what we're going to do there, but somewhere inside of about an hour, we'll want to get into the coldsoak business. We certainly don't want to do it at 12. Talking to the trajectory people - what they thought about water boiling - something to keep in mind is the fact that they do see your water dumps and water boiling on your trajectory plot. It seems to be that it's a function of their computational scheme rather than a function of the fact that the trajectory is being perturbed that much. So it looks like one time that we're going to consider, if we're going to do some of this water boiling, we may do it just prior to the midcourse after all the tracking is settled down and they know what the midcourse correction will be. Then in that period just prior to the midcourse we can do it, and they'll pick up their tracking again following the midcourse correction. So if someone proposes that the - - It is probably nice to know that we are not throwing away our data at the most important time, that it is a function of the computer program rather than so much a function of your trajectory being changed.
Let me ask you one thing then. Do you want a coldsoak sometime prior to the midcourse correction for 1 hour. Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Not really. I think we are looking at that prior to the midcourse correction as being the time when we would like to check out the water boilers. The coldsoak does involve some water boiler, too, but that's going to be done right before entry when these things are not going to be very sensitive, and if we don't do it in 12 hours, it is not real clear where the coldsoak takes place or where you turn on the secondary water boiler. In looking through the entry checklist tonight, we didn't find a place for that.
Okay. Is it really clear that you need the cold soak? We kind of figured on sometime prior to SEP bringing up the secondary EVAP, and also having the primary at that point sometime prior to that date on your suggestion.
Okay. We're talking about doing that like an hour prior to SEP; but in the pre-SEP check, one of the things we power down was the secondary loop. And they won't need to turn it back.
We do that to save - -
Right. We're doing that to keep our power profile where we want it. And then we're going to be turning it back on sometime prior to entry. And the time to turn it on in entry, of course, isn't specified because as you turn it on, the voltages show that they can hack it.
Hopefully, right after separation.
That sounds like a real good place. Okay. I'm sure we're going to discuss that one a little bit more, Bill. But right now those are the kind of things we're talking about doing. And on the high gain, there is still a lot of discussion about as to what - exactly what we saw and what it means. And I think it is a little too early to tell you anything about that one.
Roger. I think it's got X-ray eyes.
That's as good as some of the explanations.
Yes, I think that's what they hashed out on the ground, Ken.
Okay. I think we all agree that we don't want to try experimenting with it if we really don't know what it is we're looking at.
Roger. I've written down some numbers here that I hope will be helpful.
Okay. Fine.
And I'll give them to you in the debriefing.
Real fine.
I don't think it's any great big deal, because the antenna switching is not hard at all and the ... is required to work; if it doesn't work as advertised, at least it works in a reasonable manner.
Okay. And we're looking at 120 hours for the next water dump, Bill.
Ken, is it my imagination, or do you have the music running?
I'm sorry; say again.
Is it my imagination, or do you have the music running?
I think it's your imagination.
Uh-oh. Don't let the doctors hear that.
It's too late; he already heard you.
I must be getting that detached feeling.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, 8.
Roger. Just to make sure the urge to get red and blue filter shots of the moon haven't crept into this TV test. We have got red and blue filter shots of the moon, so you need not worry about that.
Okay. I don't think that would throw it away. I think we're trying to come up with something definitive so that postflight will have some real good data to compare with what we do on the ground for future work. I would like to have you go over and take a look at the battery Charlie, please.
I'm on my way.
Okay. Battery Charlie, that's about 36.8 volts.
Okay, 36.8. Thank you.
Roger.
Also with respect to the TV test, I would think that we could probably get a pretty good handle on the operation just by taking red and blue and polarizing shots of the earth independent of the TV, but within the same time frame or at about the same range we had the TV last time.
Okay. That's what - the second portion of this really is asking that we do this with the Hasselblad, and again we won't be using the red and blue filters so we have our baseline.
Taking a picture of the earth with the Hasselblad is no big deal because it does swing by the earth now and then. But trying to get the TV and the Hasselblad all pointed to the earth at the same time would really be tough.
Roger. I don't think that it's that time-critical, but I'll ask.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, 8.
Go ahead, 8.
We're going to hold up on the LiOH change for about a half an hour. The PCO<sub>2</sub> reading is low, and we don't want to wake up the CDR. It's right by his feet.
Good headwork.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Bill. We are coming up on the P52 and then the P23 sightings, and there is some concern that if we just go directly to P23 attitude that we are liable to overheat quad Charlie. So we would like to have you maneuver to place the minus X-axis towards the sun now. And I have some gimbal angles here for you. And if we take it over there and point the minus X at the sun between now and the time we have to start into the alignment, then the P23 business - we will tend to coldsoak Charlie, and then we will be able to go through the P23 operations without worrying about the temperatures.
Okay. Give me them.
Okay. Roll 183.3, pitch 136.7; yaw 13.5.
Right. 183 roll, 137 pitch, and 14 yaw.
Okay.
Actually, we worked out up here on Lovell's slide rule and got 183.25 roll.
Houston, you wanted to go to this coldsoak attitude prior to the P52, did you not?
We would like to go to the coldsoak attitude now.
And that was to keep from heating up quad D, was it?
Negative. That's quad Charlie.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Roger, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. The P23 that is coming up next - we will want to do a water dump as soon as we are through with that P23. We'll dump down to 30 percent, and this ought to be the last dump of the mission. Over.
Okay. You think that we will end up generating enough water to fill her up prior to entry.
Affirmative.
Okay. We are at that attitude you gave us, so we stopped the roll a little bit short. We're more like 150 degrees roll right now.
Okay, Bill. On that water dump, we expect to have 90 percent.
Okay.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We are done with the P52 and arranged for the P23. Was there any constraint you wanted, for length of time you wanted to stay in this attitude?
Negative, Bill. When you are finished with P23, we will go back into PTC.
Okay. We are going to maneuver for P23 now.
Roger. We are watching your tank pressures.
Okay. Thank you. We will do an optical first and then do the P23.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are handing over to Madrid in about 15 seconds. Over.
Roger. And good morning, Jerry, or good afternoon, or whatever it is.
Good morning, Jim. It's about 6:30 in the morning.
Apollo 8, Houston. How do you read?
Loud and clear. How us?
Roger; the same.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Morning, Frank. Looks like we have lost the transducer on the primary radiator OUT temperature. We are showing an off scale high. The rest of the loop looks real fine, though. When you get a chance, would you take a look at it and see if you're in the same position. Over.
Which one is it?
Primary radiator OUT temperature.
Ours is showing 100 off scale high, also.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. About this RAD output temp: does your telemetry show that it happened all of a sudden?
That's affirmative, Bill.
Okay. I'm on malfunction 23, step 2. It looks to me like there is a small possibility we might be boiling, but I doubt it. So you just want to hop over to step 4 and consider that a closed case.
Roger. We consider it closed.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Frank, all of your primary loop temperature readings look just fine. Your EVAP IN temperatures are normal and indicate you are getting normal mixing.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. For the P23 attitude that you are in right now, your quad tank temperatures are better than we expected. We're still monitoring, and it's looking good.
Thank you. After we complete this, do you want us to return to the PTC attitude? Is that correct?
That is affirmative, Frank.
Would you have someone get up the gimbal angles for us to point the X-axis at the earth at the TV time, please?
Wilco.
Also, Jerry, I would like to know our range and velocity at TV time.
Roger, Frank. You want the range and velocity at TV time.
Right.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. At 128 hours, your altitude is 97 413, your velocity is - -
Stand by just a minute.
Okay.
At 128 hours, you say?
Roger. That's TV time.
Okay.
Your altitude is 9 413; velocity is 6072; roll is 1 degree, pitch is 58, yaw 0,
Thank you.
You are welcome.
I just got a newspaper, Frank. I will go through it and pick out the news items for you.
Good. That will be great. We're just eating breakfast.
How are you having your eggs this morning?
Bacon. All except Lovell. He's having eggs Benedict.
It figures.
That Timber Cove crew, you know, they -
That's the gourmet crowd.
Silk-stocking set.
Jerry, in doing these P23's, we were just about over Africa most of the time. At least, it was in view; nice weather over there this time of year.
Roger. You want to go down there?
Do a little hunting.
Jerry, Jim Lovell just checked the P30, P21, and says you are right, 97 800 miles.
Roger. Thank you, Jim.
We ought to have these computers flight qualified in another couple of missions.
Yes.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. Was MCC 6 determined for exactly 122 hours, when you came up with that six-tenths of a foot per second?
Roger. Jim, at exactly 122 we were figuring 0.5.
Roger. I'll try it again now at the same time using the P37 with MA. The last time we did it, before the last sightings, I got 2 feet per second. I'm going to see what I come up with this time.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We are ready for you to start your waste water dump anytime now. Could we have a crew status report?
You may, we had a good night sleep. Everyone slept at least 7 hours yesterday, and we have just finished breakfast, drunk a lot of water, and I think we are in very good shape; just used the exerciser.
Roger, Frank.
What would you like to know about?
That's about it. Are you ready for some morning news?
Yes.
Okay. There is really not a whole lot in the news this morning. Things are kind of quiet. I guess the biggest news is the accident rate - the holiday deaths - which is certainly not very pleasant news, but we had 233 people killed nationally, and 9 of them were in Houston on Christmas Eve, and Christmas. In the world news, the families made the news again. This is Associated Press: "The families of Apollo 8 crew sent a Christmas message to Navy Commander Lloyd Bucher, Captain of the USS Pueblo crew, released this week by North Korea. The message, addressed to Commander and Mrs. Bucher, at San Diego Navy hospital read 'You have been in our thoughts and our prayers. Your reunion has brought great joy into our heart this Christmas day. Our best to you personally and to all of the families under your command'. And it was signed 'Families of the crew of Apollo 8.' Space officials said that the message had been suggested and written by Mrs. Frank Borman.
Thank you.
Let see. Elsewhere in the national news, the newlyweds, David and Julie Eisenhower, came away from their secret honeymoon hideaway to have Christmas dinner with President-elect Nixon and the family. In New York city, the world's busiest harbor was reduced to almost complete inactivity Christmas day, due to a 5-day old longshoreman strike and a rare hiatus in shipping schedule. No ships arrived or left the harbor. Ferries, running on reduced holiday schedule, provided the only marine activity.
Here is an interesting little feature item that is kind of good to hear. It seems that up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, they have a new youth gang. It's called the Gilnet Gang. It roams the streets of Ann Arbor, acting in secret, and sometimes bypassing the law. They call themselves the Guerillas for Good. Some of the things they have done is, painted a bridge that was covered with obscenities. They painted it one night. A condemned house with - it's popular with neighborhood children, but dangerous, was boarded up. Downtown planters unfilled because of a debate over which group was responsible, business or government, were filled with flowers. A hedge, thought to be hampering vision, at busy intersection was trimmed, and the owner was angered. Trash along a portion of the Huron River was picked up. Members of the gang are anonymous teenagers who ask for no individual recognition. Their aim is to slice red tape, to get things - good things in their opinion - done. The organization has a faint religious overtone. It's sort of an ecumenical group, said an assistant professor at the University of Michigan who acts as an informal sounding board for the gang's ideas. The name is from St. Peter, the Fisherman's Net. And it is remote enough not to be identified with any particular church. There is a thread of Robin Hood running through this thing, said their teacher, who also prefers to remain anonymous. A lot of their activities are extra-legal. When the system bogs down, they directly administer good, rather than go through the red tape channels. The gang is made up of about 55 highschool kids, boys and girls, and there's another 40 or 50 who belonged to the gang before they graduated. The idea for the gang evolved from a trip to Detroit slum area, where a church group - youth group noted the way that street gangs operate. They were impressed with the methods of operation and decided to organize for somewhat different reasons. 'It was the chance to do things for the pure sake of giving,' said the gang's advisor.
That is about it as far as the world and national news and the features is concerned. On the sport page, Hank Stram of the Kansas City Chiefs was named as the AFL coach of the year. This is the second time for him in three seasons. The voting was done by an Associated Press panel of 30 sports writers and sportscasters, three from each city. The nearest one to him was Weeb Ewbank. Other coach's that received votes were Sid Gilman of San Diego, and Lou Sabin of Denver. As for the Shriners College All Star game yesterday, the North cooled the South 3 to 0. Michigan State's Dick Berlinsky booted a 23 yard field goal in the first quarter and it was all the North needed to beat the South Wednesday, in the Shrine's College All Star football game. Let's see, I guess the interesting things about this are that first downs, North 19, South 16; rushing, North 214, South 169; passing was North 96, South 109. So, all in all, it looks like they were evenly matched. Looks like Parseghian and his Notre Damers weren't as strong as ole Howard was worrying about.
Roger. We are dumping the water now, Jerry.
Okay, Frank.
For the big Astro Blue Bonnet game, the big basketball classic followed by the Astro Blue Bonnet Bowl in the Dome: SMU and Oklahoma have arrived. They are getting ginned up for the big game. Doesn't say here which are favored. I will look that up and let you know later, if one is favor here. The Davis Cup is underway now, down in Australia, and the US is bidding to recapture that again, and apparently we're favored to recapture the supremacy today. Another item in the news, is O. J. Simpson; he was named player of the year in college football for the second consecutive season by the Walter Camp Football Foundation. Woody Hayes, as I told you yesterday, was named coach of the year.
Roger.
Well, I guess that is about it Frank.
Thank you, Jerry. I appreciate that.
Jerry, this is Jim. We concur on that midcourse 6.2 of a foot per second - is what we get.
Real fine, Jim.
Do you just want to turn off your radios and come back without us?
No. We can't read out the amazing erasable memory if we have to go into PROGRAM 01 again. (Laughter)
I'd tried to get us back on the launch pad a little bit earlier.
Frank, one other little item in the news here, I thought might be interesting is - . Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead. You are loud and clear.
Okay. I got interrupted there for a minute. Bob Hope is back out in Viet Nam again with his troops, doing a great job as usual. One little name in the news story here is from the USS New Jersey. Bob Hope joked from atop of a huge gun turret yesterday - or Wednesday - to delight the 1500 men aboard the battle ship New Jersey on its 20th Christmas entertaining US troops abroad. Hope and his 27 member troop entertained the New Jersey seamen after attending a Christmas mass aboard the carrier Hancock, both off Viet Nam. "This must be the biggest Cris Craft in the world," Hope told the seamen. "It looks like Wake Island with a rudder." "I think it was nice of them to take the ship out of mothballs just to give me a 21-gun salute," he said. Hope joked while standing on one of the ships 16 inch gun turrets. The sailors were particularly impressed by a squad of long legged girls who came aboard with Hope including Actress Ann-Margaret and Miss World.
Did you say that was his 20th trip ever there at Christmas time, or overseas at Christmas time?
That's right, it's the 20th time he has been over - overseas for Christmas with the troops.
He's as old as Jack Benny.
Roger. Hey, you can turn off the water dump now.
We're in the process, or as we say in the aerospace business: that's in work.
Roger. You do good work.
That other aviator that's going around the world, Max Conrad with his light plane - he spent Christmas day in the Antarctics - at Puento Aranes in Chili; he's waiting for good weather so he can continue his flight down to the South Pole. He hopes to get around the world. He is going around both Poles, and he's going to fly from Palmer to Byrd, from Byrd to the South Pole, and then return home to the United States by way of New Zealand, Australia, and Hawaii.
Brother. He had better take some No Doze with him.
I tried to talk Frank into the same trip.
You can give him a weather report from Apollo 8. The South Pole was really clobbered or at least it was the other day.
Roger.
I don't imagine there are many alternates down there.
No, I don't think so.
We have some pretty clear weather up here.
No fog, huh?
Not outside.
Actually, it's snowing outside right now with that waste water dump that Bill just did.
Roger. Does it look a little bit like Christmas?
Right.
Jerry, do you have a decision about what we are going to do about this next midcourse?
No, Frank. We don't need it.
Okay. I just wanted to make sure officially we'll scrub MCC 6?
Affirmative.
I guess - Jim said that was already official. I was sleeping at the time. I didn't hear it.
Okay. Frank, by the way, how do you feel about your EMS now? You feel like you've got all the answers to the little funnies you saw earlier?
Yes. The answer is don't turn it into AUTO fast. It seems to be very sensitive to jerks, or separation.
Okay, you, you figure it's all pretty much just a switch throwing anomaly and if you play it by the numbers and then slow and deliberate you will be okay?
Yes. Ken, I'm getting razzed up here because I said it was sensitive to jerks.
(Laughter) We thought of that, too, down here.
Yes, I figured you did.
I told Ken last night at separation after TLI, when we separated from the S-IVB, we got a nice bang out of the pyros and the EMS jumped over 100 feet per second.
Jerry, do you want to - I've got it in the flight plan to start charging our battery B. Do you want that started at 100 now also?
Affirmative, Frank.
Okay.
Frank, we expect it will take about 3 or 4 hours.
We're starting it.
Okay.
And we're happy to report the earth is getting larger.
Roger, that's comforting. Looks like you are going to make earth instead of Venus, huh?
Right.
Apollo 8, Houston. Your friendly guidance officer has got a LM vector update for you and a CMC time update. Over.
Okay. We'll go to P00. P00 in ACCEPT.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. The updates are complete. The computer is yours. You can go to BLOCK.
Roger; BLOCK.
Houston. We won't transfer that state vector, since we are not going to do that MCC. Is that all right?
Okay. Real fine, Frank.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
We are proceeding with the chlorination.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. BIOMED switch to CENTER, please.
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.
MARK.
Roger.
Old joke.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.
Okay, thank you, we are starting the P23.
Roger, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. We have lost all CMC data on you. The last data we had showed a high and middle gimbal angle. Over.
No. I'm fine. How come you lost those CMC data.
I think maybe it was just your movement - movement out of PTC.
I see, fine. Thank you, it was high. I was watching it though.
Okay. We have data now.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
We are noticing our quad A helium tank is starting to go up again. You got any ideas on that.
Yes. We are watching it too, Frank. So far, it's still okay and we are talking about it.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, Frank, this helium tank in quad A - it looks like we may have bothered you up unnecessarily on this thing. It appears to be no problem as best as we can tell. We got a few of the minds together talking about it, and it's been down rated quite a bit. Also there - the folks down here monitoring the P23 suspect that Jim is shooting on star number 22 rather 02, so he may be having-some problems.
Oh no. We've changed; we are on star 02 on the moon.
Okay.
Frank, I may have to add some names to my chicken list.
About what?
Helium tank A, quad A.
Roger. I just don't want to be the one that proves the fracture mechanics people are right.
Roger, Frank.
This attitude is going to have us right square into the sun, too.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Apollo 8, Houston. We are going to need some data from your past P23 marks. We missed some items, and so don't put it away and when you finish this next P23 we'll get it all together.
Okay.
Roger. Got some information for you on this PTC that we'll be going to right after this next P23 exercise. We'd like you this time to try the nose north attitude, that's pitch of 180, and a yaw of 315, and also we'd like to give another look at this mode free type of PTC and we think maybe we'll get a little bit of spin stabilization if we try it at 0.3 degrees per second on the roll rate rather than 0.1. So if you figure on doing that at 124:30 we'll see what kind of information we can get out of it.
Okay. You know what I think of that, don't you? I'll be happy to do it, but I think it's playing games.
Roger, Frank, you're burning right now 1.4 pounds per hour with attitude hold in pitch and yaw. We're kind of interested to see if 0.3 degrees per second will reduce your RCS usage due to spin stabilization.
Yes, I know. I predict that it will not.
Okay.
Jerry, I'm a little concerned about the temperature. We're getting kind of warm in here, and also the evaporator outlet temperature is up around 45 degrees. Do you have any trend that we're getting less efficient operation of the radiators?
Frank, EECOM says everything looks nominal down here. You might try a change in your cabin temperature heat exchanger there.
No, we don't have the fans on, but what we have done is put up a window shade. That seems to help it. We've been getting a lot more sun in the cabin this way.
Roger. We'll keep a sharp eye on things and keep you posted.
Roger. I don't mind playing games because, you guys have been very nice in the five and a half days. If you want to play games in the next half hour, we'll play.
Roger, Frank.
Jim is trying this set with the eye relief optics so we can give you some information on that.
Okay.
I think it would be very difficult to extrapolate anything that you are getting out of this bit business to a LM-command module combination, because the spacecraft handles quit a bit different just with the change of fuel load, including the difference in drifting off and roll.
Roger, Frank. We just got finished discussing that, too. We agree with your point of view on that one. I think this is more of a curiosity thing than anything at all.
I think it's fine. No sweat. We don't have anything else to do here for about another 10 hours.
Okay.
Jerry, what I'm kind of curious about is the fuel usage. Now with P23 and what we were doing, we have a lot more fuel.
Jim, we'll take a look at that fuel usage bit. Right now, the trend looks like it is getting better as we would expect with a lighter weight.
We'll try to get a little more definitive for you here.
Okay.
We really - we shouldn't complain about the fuel usage on that SPS engine though, because we're sure getting a lot of miles per gallon out of it.
Roger, Frank. Frank, we'll enter you in the Shell road test on that.
Yes, we don't have any TCP in it, or what is that, TCP? Yes. That's the problem. If we'd had that, we would have probably used only half the fuel.
Oh, you mean Platformate?
That's right, Platformate.
If you will get the people to spread out one of those banners around the target area, we'll try to break it, you know, and coast through it.
Okay. We'll call some of the paper companies and see if they can find a roll big enough.
It won't take a big roll, just about 30 feet.
Roger.
Onboard NAV.
Tell the doctors that we put William to sleep.
Roger. You won't leave any scars will you?
No. No, he's got his tape recorder with him.
Bill said to call Valerie and have her to rewind the tape recorder - his tape recorder at home.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
I hate to tell you this, Frank, because Jim probably won't even be able to wear his COMM carrier anymore, but that last set of marks put your state vector right on top of the MSFN state vector.
Come off that, Jerry. Come on; you promised.
I'll get you that bottle of brandy when I get home, Jerry.
Maybe we can get him to go to PROGRAM 01 again today, too.
Roger. That sounds good.
Apollo 8, Houston. Also, on the flight plan for 124:30, we would like for you to run an O<sub>2</sub> purge on the fuel cells.
Okay.
Hey, Jerry. We were going over the checklist on entry here, you know?
Roger, Frank.
I've got a question. Is John Harpold around?
Roger. He is listening.
John, I can't remember. Is the lift vector up head-down or - -
Jerry, I'm beginning to worry up here.
Roger. It depends on which way your nose is pointing.
Touché.
You might note for the people at MIT that the next series of stars will be shot by the master navigator with a space helmet on and long eye relief eyepieces.
Roger. That ought to cut his speed down a little bit.
Right.
Frank, while you are talking about the entry checklist, this cold soak - have you decided exactly where you want to do it there prior to entry
Well, I understood that EECOM talked that over with Bill, and we do it 1 hour prior to entry. We'll do it wherever you say is the best.
Okay. One hour is fine. It's just a matter of finding time in the time line to do it.
I think we can initiate it 1 hour before SEP.
Okay. Fine. Sounds like a winner.
Really got all zeroes with that helmet on.
Roger. We just noticed that.
Jim's going to leave the helmet off now for the rest of them, I think; it gets a little anoxic in there. These helmets don't have face plates, and we have a difficult time breathing with that on.
Roger.
Okay. Jerry, that completes the P23. Did you have something else you want us to do now? You wanted to check on something from the last set.
Roger, Frank. We need to get some numbers that we weren't able to copy down here. Stand by just one. Frank, on your first P23, we missed three marks on star number 2. We missed mark number 3 trunnion.
Okay. Three trunnion is 05650.
Okay, 05650. Then star number 1, mark 2. We need the trunnion on that one, too.
04216.
And on star number 1, mark 3, the DELTA-R and ΔV|DELTA-V.
DELTA-R is 00006, ΔV|DELTA-V 00001.
Roger. Four balls 6 and four balls 1. Okay. Frank, your PTC attitude is pitch 180, yaw 315, and roll rate 0.3 degrees per second. The reason for wanting to point it north is not because we are concerned at all about any changes due to venting, there's been, as we can tell, no effects on your trajectory by venting. We just want to try out that direction on it.
That's fine. We are going to stay in for about two more seconds while Jim takes the pictures through the sextant for the optics people.
Okay, Frank. And then, also, we are looking for a fuel cell O<sub>2</sub> purge when you get a chance.
That's right. At - I got the word now; it's supposed to be at 124:30.
Right.
Okay. We'll do it.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. For your P37 that's coming up that you are going to run, use a midcourse 7 time of 144:46. Also just a little note here, the trajectory is looking so good, it looks like you can make the corridor without even making a midcourse 7.
Roger. 144:46 for the P37.
Affirmative.
Thank you.
Jerry, this is Jim.
Go ahead, Jim.
We are going to set this up for the normal PTC mode for a few minutes until Frank gets through with the - another step of the call.
Roger, Jim. When the time is auspicious, would you shift the BIOMED switch over to left side?
I think we ought to shift it over right now.
Okay. No, they say hold it up for a little while.
... so you can see, the same data that Dr. Berry got on me in Gemini VII is also good for Frank on Apollo 8.
Roger. He heard that.
Houston, Apollo 8. - -
Apollo 8, Houston.
Do you see that PROGRAM ALARM we got when we went through P37, 1302?
Affirmative.
I'll run through it again and see what happens here.
Roger. We're monitoring.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Looks like you loaded the wrong time in P37, You should load 144:46 for your midcourse time; looks like you loaded 146:46.
Okay. I'm sorry. Yes, I have it here. I wrote it down, 146:46. Okay.
Roger.
I guess the best way to terminate this is by going back to P00, is that right?
Affirmative.
Houston, Apollo 8. It looks like a plus 2.8 foot per second correction at midcourse 7.
Roger, Jim.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Started the fuel cell purge, and I'm going to 183:15, and I'll start that three-tenths of a degree per second roll stabilization test for you.
Roger, Frank. Thanks.
Okay. There we are, and we are going to start rolling now.
Roger.
Frank, on this free pitch and yaw, if either one of them gets outside of 15 degrees from the nominal values, we'll call it off.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. I would like to have the BIOMED switch left now, if you can.
Roger, it's LEFT.
The fuel cell purged to complete, O<sub>2</sub>.
Say again, Apollo 8.
O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell purge complete.
Roger, thanks.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Looks like you've exceeded your 15 degrees offset PTC attitude, so you can go to attitude HOLD in pitch and yaw.
Okay. I'll go back to the attitude. We didn't even get around once, did we?
Doesn't look like it. So much for spin stabilization.
Well, we tried that last night several times 0.5 to 0.2 degree per second.
I think there is the phenomena known as inertial coupling that has something to do with that, huh?
Roger. That could be.
Put a bigger rudder on it.
Need some feathers, Frank.
(Laughter)
Apollo 8, Houston. On the P37 comparison; using the MSFN vectors, we get a minus 1.4 on that midcourse compared to your 2.8. We ran your solutions through our computer and we also get a 2.8, so your P37 looks good. We are busy still fiddling with the vectors and comparing them and we'll keep an eye on the difference.
Roger. It looks like we came up with a plus 2.8 though, and you say you came out with a minus 2.something.
Affirmative.
Jim, that 4 feet per second difference is worth 0.28 degrees on the flight path angle.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Frank. How is your cabin temperature looking now?
It's getting cooler, thank you. We put those shades up, and that really helps.
Okay. The primary loop down here still looks real good, so it looks like you are in fine shape. Your battery B charge ought to be done by about 127 hours, and we think you shouldn't even try to charge battery A, since it looks like, at entry interface, it is going to have 38 amp-hours on it.
I'll tell Bill that.
Okay
How is the weather down there, Jerry?
That's loud and clear.
Cold?
No, it's pretty balmy around here today.
Yes, the temperature is about in the 70's here. It's a real nice day.
Fine.
Say, Jerry, last night, Jim was saying something about turning on VHF Simplex A about 20 00 miles out. I wrote it down, but I can't seem - I can't remember where I put it. ...
Roger, Frank. We've got it in the checklist here as right around 4 minutes - 4 hours before EI, right after your nominal P23, P37 onboard comparisons, KG-1, page E-1.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. We're showing some garbage on your computer. If you will hit ERROR RESET, we can clear that PROGRAM ALARM so the next one can be identified. Over.
We don't have any PROGRAM ALARM.
I think this - this is a carryover from your last PROGRAM ALARM there on that P37.
Okay. ERROR RESET. Thank you.
That do it?
Stand by. Okay. Thank you, Frank. That did it.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Your battery is full; you can terminate charging. You've got 40 amp-hours on it now, and we've got a couple of requests for data here.
Roger.
- - requests.
Okay. We were just talking about that. I tell Bill stop. Okay. What are your requests?
The first one is - the first time somebody is down in the equipment bay, we would like to get another reading on your RCS temperatures - those six temp meter readings - -
Okay.
- - and the other one is of the boys in the back - -
We just read them again.
Beg your pardon?
We just read the RCS thruster temperatures again, and they are all pegged high.
Okay. Good deal, Frank. The other one is - the boys in the back room would like some time when everybody is awake - if you would fire up both cabin fans for about 5 minutes, they would like to see what the DELTA temperature is on the telemetry when you get the stagnation broken down and get some flow going over it. So if you can see your way clear to do that, we would like to see it same time when everybody is up.
We had that running before in the flight. Did they check it then?
You mean early in the game, when you were cool?
Yes. When we were cool. Right.
Yes. They got that data, and they were kind of interested in seeing what it looks like when the cabin is nice and warm and the temperature indicator is reading on the high side, to see how the DELTA works in the other direction.
Okay. Coming on.
Okay. Thank you.
What else, Jerry?
That's it, Frank.
Another thing, Frank, is we just want to remind you that there is no charge needed on A battery.
Hey, listen, these cabin fans - one of them sounds like it's got a bad bearing. We are going to turn it off. It's got a real squeal to it.
Okay, Frank.
Sounds like it's got something in it.
That must be Bill's teddy bear.
Say again.
That must be Bill's teddy bear.
I don't know, but there is something in there.
We will try them again, one at a time, and see if we can determine which one's got the noise.
Roger.
Number 2 is really bad. It's got a bad bearing, and it whines like mad, so we are not going to turn it on.
Roger. Thank you.
We are not going to try number 1 either; there may have - something might have got in both of them, Jerry.
Okay, Frank. That's fine.
Sounds like that MG starter of yours.
I'm afraid to turn my starter on now. It's been so long.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. We would leave the PTC long enough to go orient toward the earth for a TV shot to see if this TV thing is going off on 128.
Roger, Frank. That is fine. Do you have the gimbal angles you need?
Yes, thank you. I got them earlier today.
Okay.
I'd like to keep this one kind of short because we're trying to get some sleep earlier than yesterday.
Say again, Frank. You are getting pretty garbled.
How is that antenna?
Loud and clear, Frank.
I said, will this be a short one? We are trying to hurry things up a little bit to see if we can get as much sleep as possible.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Would you put the BIOMED switch on the right side now, please?
Roger.
Frank, do you intend to start your TV before 128?
Negative; no.
Roger.
That is what you wanted, isn't it? I thought that is what it was all squared away for.
Affirmative.
Apollo 8, Houston. Are you planning on using the wide angle lens?
I think that would be best.
Okay. Jack says you want to be sure and use the red filter and the filter holder for that One. It takes a little darker filter.
Okay.
Do you want to take both red filters on there or just the one for the one for the filter holder?
He thinks just the red one on the filter holder will do, but might not hurt to have the other one ready, just in case.
How about if we use the telephoto? It will be a little harder to focus, but it might end up a better picture.
Roger, Frank. If you want to use the telephoto lens, you ought to use the same combination you used going out, the 25A.
Okay.
Hey, Jerry.
Roger, Frank.
Ask your EECOM how many gallons of fuel we burned for TEI, will you?
Roger. In work, he's breaking out his sathometer now.
Apollo 8, Houston. We will be handing over to Goldstone in 2 minutes. Over.
Roger, Jerry.
Frank, the doctors say they are not getting anything on Bill yet. Apparently, he is not plugged up.
He is down underneath the couch getting some stuff out; he doesn't have his umbilical on.
Okay.
Tell them to look at the stuff they got yesterday. He hasn't changed at all, just as mean as ever.
Roger.
Hey, Frank, this simulation has really been great. What do you say after these photos we recycle back to TLI again?
That's fine. Bring on the backup crew.
Hey, Jerry, yesterday I tried to cycle back to the pass and 01 was lunar.
Jim, we missed that. Say it again when you get a better antenna.
Don't blame your antenna problems on us ...
Apollo 8, Houston. We are not reading you; stand by one.
Houston, do you read now?
Roger. Loud and clear.
I say, Bill will be ready in a minute; he is cycling back and forth under the couch trying to get the TV stuff out.
Okay.
Backup crew says they are ready to go.
Great. A most fantastic voyage.
Sure was.
We're not through yet. We've still got 100 000 miles to go. You know, we kind of feel like it was all over with TEI, but we're still a long way.
Jerry, what I was saying before: I tried to hurry up the voyage home by calling up PROGRAM 01 to get us back on the PAD, but it didn't work.
Well, that's the best excuse I've heard so far, Jim.
The best of many.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. On TEI, you burned 1480 gallons.
Thank you.
Frank, are you going to need Jim's slide rule for that calculation?
I got 162.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Roger. This is one of those rare occasions where Bill left his seat and I am now sitting in it, and for the first time, I can see the earth. I'm looking through his monocular; it's pretty nice.
Roger.
You had a little weather today it appears.
Last word from the weather guys here was that it was clear.
Well, we could see South America and Florida and through the lower part of the U.S. Looks like there is a weather front going over into the central part of the United States, lot of clouds over the northwest area. Florida is clear; it looks like the east coast is pretty clear.
Roger. Clear but cold.
Lot of clouds up in Canada.
Maybe the geese will go home.
Jerry, we are going to turn it on and see how the picture is.
Roger.
Nothing yet, Frank.
Takes a while to warm up, I think.
Any luck yet, Jerry.
Not yet, Frank.
We got a picture now, Frank. It's twitching.
The earth is on now, Frank.
How's it look?
We are seeing about half of it. You moved in the wrong direction. Okay. It's coming back, a little more. Good, now a shade toward the terminator.
A little bit more toward the terminator and in the same direction you were moving it before. Right; you have got it centered right in the middle.
Now move it away from the terminator just a bit.
Good picture.
Okay. You want us to wait until 128, right?
Affirmative. Frank, move your camera to the right; I want to see which way the earth moves on my screen.
Okay. Moving your camera to the right moves the earth to the left on our screen. On our screen, the terminator is almost parallel to the horizontal direction, and the dark part is on the top.
Okay. We will turn it back on at 128, then.
Okay, Frank.
Apollo 8, Houston. Are you on a high-gain antenna?
Roger.
Roger.
What beam width are you on, Apollo 8?
NARROW.
Roger. NARROW.
This is Apollo 8. Do you read?
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.
Roger. Radio check.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. How do you read now? Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Loud and clear.
Roger. We're just trying something - -
Apollo 8, Houston. You are in the scan limit right now on the high-gain antenna; although you may have NARROW beam width selected, you are in WIDE. To improve the situation would take a pitch down and a yaw left, and we will have FAO check it and give you some angles if we need to change it.
We just got out of the scan limit by pitching up and yawing right.
Roger. You are right, Frank.
Are we still in wide band, or are we in narrow band now?
We are checking.
Apollo 8, Houston. EECOM says you are in good shape now.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. COMM check.
Loud and clear.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're getting television.
Roger. How's the picture?
Roger. The picture is on the lower right hand of our screen.
Camera should go down away from the terminator and to the right.
Still down and about the same place; a little worse; now it's coming in
Are you getting it now, Jerry?
Roger. We've got most of it; keep moving off to the right. Good. You have it centered right now.
Well, the earth looks a little bigger to us today, not much, but it's somewhat bigger. I'm sitting over in the right hand seat now; Bill has got the TV camera; Frank is helping him out aiming it directly to hit the earth. I hope we have a good picture. Can you see the clouds?
Affirmative. We sure can. Move it up toward the terminator - correction, away from the terminator just a shade.
At the tip of South America, there is a great swirl of clouds down there. It looks like a great storm. I wonder if you can see it.
Roger. We see a large swirl just south of the terminator.
Roger. And then up to the left hand side, or towards the north, we can see the light waters around the West Indies, and we can actually see Florida. I'm looking through Bill's monocular, and I can see the various land masses, South America and the central part and southern part of the United States.
Roger. Move-a little bit away from the terminator now, a little left with the camera and a little further from the terminator.
Say again, Jerry.
Okay. You're moving it toward the center of the screen now, and the earth is off on the left side of our screen.
Real fine. That's good. Hold it right there.
What we're thinking about right now, Jerry, is hitting that wedge angle, about 2 degrees their limit. When we come back, the earth looks pretty small right from here.
Roger.
You got it, Bill.
As I look down on the earth here from so far out in space, I think I must have the feeling that the travelers in the old sailing ships used to have: going on a very long voyage away from home, and now we're headed back, and I have that feeling of being proud of the trip, but still - still happy to be going back home and back to our home port. And that's - that's what you're seeing right here.
Roger, Bill. We'll sure be glad to get you back, too.
This is Frank Borman. We've enjoyed the television shows, and we'd like you to stay tuned in in the future because there'll be flights and rendezvous and earth orbit, and then, of course, there'll be television from the lunar surface itself in the not too far distant future. So, until then, I guess this is the Apollo 8 crew signing off, and we'll see you back on that good earth very soon.
Roger, Frank. Adios.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
We'd like you to go back to PTC. Pick either attitude that's easiest to fly to.
Roger. In work.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Your PTC attitude ought to be either a 1045 or a 18315. We'd recommend 18315. That will keep your windows out of the sun.
180, that's right. I got them mixed up, didn't I? It's 18315.
Roger.
Okay, Jerry ...
Apollo 8, this is Houston. You're unreadable due to background noise. Over.
How now, Jerry?
Loud and clear.
I say we're starting to stow the spacecraft and get all squared away and then be sleeping and eating. We'll be all thinking about entry from now on.
Roger, Frank. And now that Bill's up, we'd like to get a redundant components check.
Alright. He's putting helmets in the food boxes. Just a minute, I'll get him to do it for you.
Roger. There is no great hurry, Frank. We're - -
Roger.
We're mostly interested in looking at the secondary loop.
That's what I was going to say. I can't see any reason to check anything other than the secondary loop, can you?
That's affirmative.
Now in that cabin cold soak, we won't have any cabin fans.
Roger. I understand.
Jerry, this is Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, go.
Roger. I just got on the sextant and now looking at Texas, and the weather man is right, it looks like a pretty good day. Full of clouds down there, but not bad.
Real fine, Jim. Can you see the kids out in the yard waving?
Would you tell Pete Conrad to get his kids off my roof?
Wilco.
Jim, do you see the bright spot out in the Pacific Ocean through the sextant?
I'll try. We saw it, of course, through the windows and through the monocular. I'll see if I can spot it.
Roger.
Yes, Jerry, I can see the bright spot. It's - I guess it's the subsolar point. It's off of South America, it appears to me.  It is a grayish spot compared to the blue waters surrounding it. It's undefined in diameter, though I mean, it's not a clear round spot at all; it's just a raggedy one.
Roger. That showed up real well on the TV's picture.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to delay that request for a secondary loop check to a little better point as far as thrusting is concerned.
Fine. We can wait for a long time on that.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. Jim, we've got some bird watchers in the viewing room.
Bird watchers, huh?
Roger.
Sounds good. Who are they?
Marilyn.
Oh, well, good. Say hello to her for me.
Yes, and she's got a few troops with her, too.
Did she see the TV, I wonder?
Affirmative. Barbara and Jay are with her.
Good.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're replaying your television pictures now. We can see the Chilean coast and Florida.
Very good.
That's a pretty good little television camera, isn't it?
It sure is. With the right filters on it, it's great. That was a Schmitt input.
He must be a Jack of all trades.
Beautiful.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Bill would like to ask the friendly Flight Surgeon's permission to take a Seconal so he can sleep.
Roger. Copy.
Apollo 8, Houston. That's a "yes."
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Before Bill falls asleep, we'd like to have him go ahead and do that secondary EVAP check now at any time at his convenience, and if we don't happen to be able to monitor it with high bit rate, just let us know when you did it.
Roger. I'll tell him that evaporator check at any time.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. BIOMED switch to the CDR. Over.
Roger. In work.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Good afternoon, Jerry.
Howdy.
Okay. Somebody said something about checking out the evaporator - evaporators. What do you want to do?
Roger. Before we get too far along, we'd like to see, essentially with the secondary evaporator check, what we got on the redundant components check.
Okay. Stand by.
Roger. EECOM says to be sure and let it go for at least 5 minutes.
Roger. Now you want to check out the primary evaporator also, or did you decide it's not necessary?
I guess they decided it's not necessary, Bill.
Okay.
Okay. Secondary glycol loops coming on the line.
Roger, Bill.
And the secondary evap's coming on the line.
Roger.
And it's stabilized the leg, oh, for about 5 minutes.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Alright. What do you have in mind here in the way of activating the secondary loop prior to separation? It looks like if we do have a cabin fan problem, we won't be able to do a full-blown coldsoak. Is there anything that we can do that'll do any good?
Well, right now, Bill, in the checklist, we're showing this activation at about minus 1 hour. Let me check with EECOM for a minute and see if they got any more words considering the cabin fan situation.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Looks like a good time. One hour before SEP - entry interface would be fine.
Okay. It won't do any good, then, to fool around with these cabin temp valves. ...
Bill, stand by. You're - got a lot of background noise.
Go ahead now, Bill.
Read me now, Jerry?
Loud and clear.
Okay. This coldsoak is built around the premise that you've got a cabin heat exchanger, in my view; and if you haven't got a cabin heat exchanger, I'm wondering just what you can do.
He's thinking.
Apollo 8, Houston. We think it'll still do a little bit of good so we'd just as soon go through with it.
Okay. Even bypassing the suit heat exchanger and that part of it too, huh?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Also, Bill, your secondary loop is looking good.
Okay. We just had 5 minutes. I'll deactivate it now.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
Hey, Jerry. When do you want to crank up the VHF, anyway?
Roger. VHF Simplex - well, we had that on the checklist for about minus 4 hours.
Okay. We wanted - we wanted to put it out prior to MAX range, don't you think? Get an idea of when we're picking it up?
Roger. Stand by, Bill. They're talking about it.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Entry interface minus 4 hours is just about right for the VHF. That is about - oh, 142 GET.
Roger. Thank you.
The next voice you hear will be that of the smiling Irishman.
Outstanding.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Good morning, James.
Oh, it's Michael Collins, is it? Good morning to you.
Righto. And we're looking at your pitch CDU readout down here and looks to us like you are about 25 degrees off the 180 for your PTC, and we were just wondering how come?
We've been looking at that, too. It keeps wandering off in pitch for some reason more than yaw. I was just about ready to go back to it again. I had to go back one time, and I was just seeing how far she would drift. I thought it would drift out a ways and come back by itself, but it is not doing it.
Okay.
We'll get back there.
Houston, Apollo 8. We're in the process of doing the trunnion bias check; then we will go to P23.
Roger. Thank you, Frank.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go.
We like to have the PTC attitude to comply with P23 requirement.
Roger, Frank. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Any time you want to start on those P23's is just fine.
Okay. I was just checking. I just wanted to know how our thermal control was going before we left.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Your temperatures are looking good, Frank. There is still a differential temperature between quads, but nothing that would cause us in the slightest to worry about doing P23.
Roger. Understand.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead.
Roger, Jim. We've been looking at these stars that we gave you this time for P23. It looks like the second star, number 11, has a trunnion angle right out to the limit, about 49.7 degrees. And we're thinking it might be a good idea to switch you over to star 1, which has a much smaller trunnion angle. What do you think? Star 1 is Alpheratz.
Fine with me; I would just as soon take star 1.
Okay. That will be then in place of star 11, star 1, and in place of lunar far horizon, lunar near horizon; and it remains two sets. Over.
Roger. Star 1, lunar near horizon, two sets.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger. Fine. Old golden fingers there is getting so swift we missed some marks on the downlink. I wonder - if you hand recorded them, could you read us your three marks - trunnion angles, your three trunnion angles on star 2 and the last four trunnion angles on star 1. Over.
Do you read me still, Mike?
Stand by. We're not reading you good enough, so we'll wait until you get a better OMNI.
That ought to be a good one.
That is a good one. That's loud and clear.
Okay. Star 2 trunnion angle, first one 05245, second one 05243, next one 05241; last 4 trunnion angles 04133, 04133, 04132, 04132.
Thank you kindly.
Can you give me some idea on the updates from the midcourse that we might need, and all that good stuff, Mike?
Yes, sure can, Frank. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Mike.
Okay. We're predicting at the nominal time of your next midcourse, which is entry interface minus 2 hours - we're predicting 1.4 foot per second burn which changes your gamma at entry interface by a tenth of a degree. Right now with no further maneuvers, your gamma is minus 6.39 degrees, and we're going to steepen it up very slightly to hit the center of the target line, and it will be after the maneuver minus 6.51. Over.
Very good.
Anything else you want like that?
No. I just wondered - we hadn't heard whether we were going to do it or not and so on.
Roger.
When we get the PAD data, we'll get it all out here.
Yes. We'll be sending the PAD data up to you in about another 2 hours, Frank; about 132 hours GET.
Okay. We - this will be the last set of star sightings we do now nominally, and even if we lose COMM, we'll just come on in with what we got.
Okay, Frank.
Incidentally, that COMM has been fantastic. I don't know how you've heard us, but boy, it's just like you are next door even in lunar distances.
Yes. It has really been great with rare exceptions when you are on a bad OMNI right before you switch. Then we get an awful lot of background noise, but in general, it has been excellent, and boy, we are really thankful for it because reading all these updates would be bad news with bad COMM, as you know.
Right.
Say, Mike, have you noticed the confidence the Captain has in his navigator?
He hasn't called you Goldfinger yet.
No. He is disregarding anything I can do. We're coming in anyway.
I suspect he is right on that point.
Well, back to the drawing board.
As usual, we are all a little pooped. I've got Bill sleeping now, and then Jim and I will swap just as soon as we get through with these stars.
Well, you're sounding real good, and you are doing good work.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Roger, Frank. If you get a chance to, we'd like for you to read us down your trunnion calibration number. We missed that one on the downlink, and we have an update for your passive thermal control attitude.
Okay. The trunnion calibrations were all zeros.
Roger. Thank you, and on page 2-104 the PTC attitudes should read zero pitch and 45 degrees yaw. Over.
Zero pitch and 45 degrees at 2-104.
Roger. And we'd like some PRD readings for those of you who are up and around.
Zero pitch, 45 yaw, it is?
Roger. Thank you.
I'm asking. I wasn't sure I copied it right.
Yes. That's affirmative, Frank. Zero pitch, 45 degrees yaw.
My PRD now reads 2.85.
2.85.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. Over.
This is 8. Loud and clear. How us?
Roger. You're loud and clear, Jim. We'd like to get your PRD reading while we've got you up and a flight plan change we're suggesting on page 2-107 when you're ready to copy.
Roger. Stand by.
I'm the only person up, and my PRD is reading 0.15.
Roger. I understand; 0.15.
And I'll bet that Bill's is still reading 0.64.
That's okay; don't bother him with it. He's asleep.
Okay. Go ahead with your flight plan change.
Houston, Apollo 8. Go ahead with your flight plan change.
Okay, Jim. On page 2-107, we're recommending that you delete that P52 and just-stay in PTC attitude. Your platform is real good, and we don't feel that alignment's necessary. One is coming up again at 139 hours anyway. And also, on that same page, we'd like to delete the "begin cabin cold soak." Over.
Righto. Will delete the "begin cabin cold soak," and we'll delete the P52.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Roger, Apollo 8. This is Houston. Over.
Roger. Mike. Are you still planning to send up these updates at 132 hours?
Yes; affirmative, Jim. We're getting them together now.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Would you please go to P00 and ACCEPT, Jim, and we'll send you a P27.
We're ready for you.
Okay. Sending up a state vector to LM slot.
Roger.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. You can go back to BLOCK; we got the P27 in and verified. It was a state vector update to the LM slot, and I'm standing by for the midcourse correction number 7 and the entry PAD at your convenience. Over.
Roger. Stand by.
Go ahead with midcourse number 7.
Okay. Midcourse correction number 7, RCS/G&N: 31600, not applicable, not applicable, 144:45:57.99, minus 00014, plus five zeros, plus 00001. Are you with me so far? Over.
Roger. With you.
Good. 000 304 000, not applicable, 000 191 00014 004 00014 450 - -
Hey, Mike, hold it. Hold it, Mike.
Okay. Holding.
You said not applicable for HA and HP; I started to copy it down, and then I didn't get the right number sequence. Did you skip down to what, V<sub>T</sub>?
No. Let's go back to apogee is not applicable, and then I just started reading the numbers again. From there, I've got a perigee and then a ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>T</sub> and then a burn time and so forth. Over.
Okay. I didn't hear a plus or minus on the HP, and I only got four numbers off of it. So could you start with HP again?
Okay. Going back to apogee, not applicable; perigee, plus 00191. And you weren't hearing things; it was my mistake. Over.
Roger.
Okay. Picking up with ΔV|DELTA-V<sub>T</sub> 00014 004 00014 45 0459 225, Shaula, up 236 000, plus 0813 minus 16503 12202 36301 146:46:41; north set of stars, Sirius and Rigel, roll 308, pitch 209, yaw 357; remarks: perigee in P30 equals plus 22.2 nautical miles. Over.
Roger. Midcourse number 7 RCS/G&N: 31600, not applicable, not applicable, 144:45:57.99. Are you with me?
I'm with you.
Minus 00014, plus all zeros, plus 00001 000 304 000, not applicable, plus 00191 00014 004 00014 45 0459 225 Shaula, up 236 000, plus 0813, minus 16503 12202 36301 146:46:41, Sirius, Rigel, 308 209 357, HP, and P30 is 22.2 nautical miles.
That's all correct, Jim, and I have the entry PAD at your convenience.
Roger. Stand by one.
Ready to copy. Mike.
Okay. Entry PAD: area mid-Pacific, 357 152 359 146:29:13 268, plus 0813, minus 16503 068 36221 651 12202 36301 146:46:13 0028, not applicable four times, in other words, DL MAX, DL MIN, VL MAX, and VL MIN - all not applicable. Starting with TO: 400 0207 0025 0333 0816 16 0590 312. And your vortex star is Zeta Persei, which is half way between Mirfak and Aldebaran, up 165, right 34 up. Remarks: use nonexit EMS pattern. Over.
Right, Mike. Stand by.
Entry as follows: mid-Pacific, 357 152 359 146:29:13 268, plus 0813, minus 165 03 068 36221 651 12202 36301 146:46:13 0028, NA 4 times, with TO 400 0207 0025 0333 0816 16 0590 312, Zeta Persei, up 165, right 34, up. And remarks: use nonexit EMS pattern. And Zeta Persei is between Mirfak and Aldebaran, and Frank can never find it anyway.
Okay. That's all correct.
We certainly don't waste much time getting down to drogue deploy, do we?
Roger. That's - that's true.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Jim. In your computer, we'd like to do an erasable memory dump again, like we did the other day, and the reason we'd like to do it is, when you did that P37 about 8 hours ago, and you remember you put that EI time for TIG and got that P00 do thing; we'd like to - We don't think there's anything in the world wrong with it. We think everything is just perfect inside the computer, but we'd like to do an erasable dump as we did the other day; go through it bit by bit. Give us something to do down here. Over.
Okay. Any time.
And I have the procedures for you when you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Okay. VERB 01 NOUN 01 ENTER, 333 ENTER, and then read out register 1, and that register 1 should be 10 000. And then if it's not, I can give you procedures for getting it to 10 000. If it is 10 000 as we expect, then VERB 74 ENTER, and that will do the dump. Over.
Roger. When do you want it?
And, Apollo 8, you can do the first part of that now at your convenience to verify that register 1 is reading 10 000, but would you hold up on the dump itself until we get our ground stations configured, please. Over.
Will do.
Jim, we're getting noisy down here. Could you switch OMNI antennas, please?
Thank you, sir.
That works pretty well, doesn't it?
Not bad. I was amazed at the communication at the moon, too.
Apollo 8, Houston. We're configured for the dump. VERB 74 ENTER at your convenience.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. The dump is complete, and it's your computer. Thank you.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Good morning, Mike. We had a little change of the guard here.
You sound real bright eyed and bushy tailed. How's it going up there?
Real great.
Apollo 8, Houston. How about giving us a countdown to PRD reading. Over?
Just mine?
Just on you, Bill. We got the other two while you were sacked out.
The one that I have now, and the one that Jim took off, which is obviously broken, it's still at 0.64.
Okay. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Roger, Bill. On your PTC attitude, we're requesting a pitch angle zero, and we're showing you about 27 degrees pitch and increasing. Over.
Roger. I've been trying to work it down to ENTER again.
They're letting you drive, after all?
I have to every now and then just to square this thing away.
Mike, I'll just give you my status here before the rest of them go to sleep; had about 3 hours sleep, another meal, and everybody's doing fine.
Roger, Bill. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check. Over.
Loud and clear.
Roger. Thanks, Bill.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Roger, Mike. How do you read?
I read you loud and clear not, Bill. I wasn't hearing here for a couple of calls. How do you read me?
I had my hands full; I was putting something down. I read you fine.
Okay. Understand. If it'll be any help to you in your PTC driving, we've computed that as you look out plus X in the COAS or just out the window, you should be pointed right at Acrux when you're in a perfect PTC attitude. We don't know if that's a help to you or not, but we thought you might enjoy trying an alternate mode of keeping the attitude under control.
Okay. From my present position, we're going to have to move Acrux a little bit.
Well, whatever you think. We just thought you might appreciate knowing.
I'll give it a try, Mike.
Can you see it all right?
Yes, I think so. There's a star out there anyway.
Houston, Apollo 8. Do you read?
Go ahead, Bill.
Actually, Mike, it's so easy to do it with the eight-ball within a reasonable sloppy limit that it's hardly worth the trouble to scootch way up in the seat to look out the COAS, and it's enough light in the cockpit where the star really isn't too easy to see. So I'm kind of inclined to use the IFR technique here where you can see the rest of the instrument panel.
Okay.
I thought you were an all-weather pilot.
Well now, you just caused Flight down here to get a "Got Ya" on CAP COMM and FAO.
Give you a little warning next time.
Apollo 8, Houston. Could you give us a better OMNI, please?
Apollo 8, Houston. We will be changing the antennas in 3 minutes. You can expect a COMM glitch. Over.
Okay, Mike.
Apollo 8, Houston. Can you switch us to OMNI Charlie, please.
Thank you, sir.
De nada.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Houston, Apollo 8. Are you still there?
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Go ahead. Over.
I was just seeing if you were still there, Mike. The Old Grey Eagle is taking over the show from here.
Which one of them?
Old Super Chief.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Bill. We had an erasable memory dump a few hours back. I think it was while you were asleep, but anyway we've checked the computer's erasable memory bit by bit, and everything agrees 100 percent. Over.
Mighty fine. Glad to hear it, Mike. Thank you.
Roger. Are you going to brief Frank on your tape recorder before you go to sleep?
He can't handle it. It's too complicated.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Give us a different OMNI, please.
Thank you, sir.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Michael.
Roger. We are going to switch our ground antennas in about a minute and a half. You can expect a COMM glitch then.
Thank you.
..., Mike.
Apollo 8, this is Houston through Carnarvon. Were you calling a minute ago, Frank?
Y'all in Australia, do you hear us?
Yes, we are reading you loud and clear now.
Carnarvon, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Reading you loud and clear through Carnarvon.
Hello, Houston.
Go ahead, Frank.
We are just listening to all the guys around the NET.
Can you hear them?
I could that time, all the way from Carnarvon to Texas.
How did they ever get an old maintenance officer on the midnight shift?
Frank, you are on GOSS Conference if you would like to be brave. Over.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston. OMNI Bravo, please.
Thank you, sir.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Have you noticed how long I've stayed locked in this PTC mode?
Just about an hour and a quarter looks to us like, Frank.
I haven't even touched the hand control here for about 20 minutes, and it just hasn't moved outside that zero; I've never seen it like this before.
Be sure and have your troops give me a call if it gets close to gimbal lock, will you? I'm snoozing a little bit now and then up here.
Yes, we sure will, Frank.
Thank you.
And if you'd switch the antennas, you'd really be good guys.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, this is Houston. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Roger. Just a check on the radio, and if it's practical, BIOMED switch left, please.
Okay, Mike. We had a crew change in the watch again.
Well, that was quick. Did you decide you didn't want to sleep after all?
Well, it wasn't my decision.
Yes, that's what I figured.
Apollo 8, Houston. We will be changing antennas in about 2-1/2 minutes; you can expect a COMM glitch.
Roger. What are you changing to?
We're switching from Carnarvon to Honeysuckle, Bill.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger, Apollo 8. Your Green Team will be signing off in a few minutes, and before we do, Charlesworth and the rest of us would like to say we have enjoyed it and look forward to seeing you back in Houston. Over.
We have sure enjoyed it, too, troops, and you guys have really done a good job. We really do appreciate it.
Well, nice words there. We will be seeing you, Bill.
Okay, Mike. We will see you, Buddy. Tell old Cliff adios for me, too.
Sure will.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Apollo 8, we'd like to have you, before you get in a P52 going here, we'd like to have you rezero the optics and read us the mechanical CDU's. We're trying to collect a little data for troubleshooting.
Roger. Stand by.
Thank you.
What's the trouble you are trying to troubleshoot?
This goes back to some of the problems we had prior to LOI; trying to see if the software readouts we're getting down here compare with the mechanical readouts. It's not a current problem as far as we know.
Okay.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Why don't you just read me the mechanical CDU's there now, and then it looks from the ground like you're clear to go ahead with the P52.
Okay. We'll get the navigator squared away here in just a minute.
Good morning, Captain.
Good morning, sir.
This will be a piece of stew out of a deep sleep. Okay, stand by one.
Trunnion mechanical CDU looks like it's reading about 1/100.
Roger.
And the shaft mechanical CDU looks like it is reading about 4/100 below zero, which would be about 364. Yes.
Understand, Jim. That is 4/100 below zero on that shaft; is that affirm?
Yes. Stand by one. About 35996 on the shaft.
Okay. Thank you. You can go ahead with P52 now.
Okay.
I always said he did better in his sleep.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. It looks like we're getting down on the service module RCS to the place where we ought to go ahead and activate the secondary service module RCS propellant.
Okay. Stand by.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Okay. We've got a new PTC attitude. For the pitch 180, and the yaw 315.
Roger. Yaw 315.
Roger. And pitch 180.
Okay.
Can't you pick one a little further away?
Not in our normal sphere.
Ken, this is Jim.
Go ahead.
Aren't we still a little high on the quantity side to activate the secondary?
Negative. We have quad Bravo and quad Delta which are getting right down, according to the calculated numbers, next to where we ought to be activating them. The numbers you are reading are going to be a little bit high, but the computer data on the ground shows that you have about 134 pounds in Bravo and Delta, and about 130 pounds is where you ought to be on the secondary.
Okay. Roger. We will activate the secondary and turn off the primary.
Okay. It's just to keep you from running one of them up.
Roger.
Secondary activation.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead.
Ken, on this maneuver, MCC 7, are you going to - are we going to burn the PAD data that we got some time ago, or is there a new maneuver coming up, or what's going on in that regard?
Okay, Apollo 8. If required, we'll give you a new one. Right now, we are looking at not making a maneuver burn at all.
You say we may not even have another one now?
That's right.
Okay. You're the boss.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Could you try another OMNI?
Apollo 8, Houston. Try another CMRI, please.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. Read you loud and clear now. Just wanted to remind you that in the event of a loss of COMM, we don't want you to burn MCC 7. Your present entry PAD is good. We'll be updating your landing points at the same time that you would have gotten MCC 7, and I'd like to have a crew status report from you when it's convenient.
Okay, Ken. I understand. If we would lose COMM, you do not want us to burn MCC 7, just go ahead and use the entry PAD you've given us?
That's affirmative. You'll be within 0.06 degrees of your entry angle target line.
Alright. The crew status is everybody has gotten real good rest last night, and everybody is in good shape. Jim is just waking up, and Bill is starting the initial stowage, and we all feel very well.
Okay.
Okay. And we'd like to - guess we need a PRD reading from you. And we'll be needing one in the neighborhood of 145-hour period, somewhere when it's convenient in there again.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. Could you give us our range - correction, our velocity and range from the earth now?
Stand by.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. At time 51, your velocity will be 9526, altitude 42946. Over.
Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. You call?
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Did you call?
Negative, this is Apollo 8. We did not call you.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. I've got some weather and recovery force status and a couple of last minute items to run down any time it is convenient for you.
Alright. It's convenient right now, any time.
Okay. For the mid-Pacific, the general condition is good. You can expect cloud bases 2000 foot scattered, visibility 10 miles, wind 070 at 12, wave heights 4 feet, altimeter 2974. Sunrise will be 17:10 Zulu, and first light 16:49 Zulu. The recovery forces: ship will be Yorktown; the aircraft will be Airboss number 1 and 2, and Recoveries 1, 2, and 3. The estimated time to a target point: the ship is - Yorktown is on the target point, Airboss aircraft 15 minutes and will be on-scene commander. Recoveries 1, 2, and 3 are SH3 Alfas, and they go with the Yorktown, so they are at the target point. All of them have swimmers aboard. If the recovery aircraft do not hear from the spacecraft; they will go ahead and put swimmers in the water, and if you are in good shape and give them a call, then they will hold off on dropping swimmers until sunrise.
Roger. Say again the sunrise and first light time for me, would you, please?
I say again, 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Notice the rather large middle gimbal angle. Over.
Thank you.
Would you say again the daylight time, please, sunrise, and first light.
Okay. Sunrise is 17:10 Zulu, and first light is 16:49 Zulu.
Thank you.
Okay. Looking over the weather I gave you was - the 2000 foot scattered at the target point may have a 6000 foot broken layer above that. At the MAX lift point, you will have about the same thing, and altimeter is the same down the range. As you go further to the east, the weather should improve slightly; there is no problem with thunderstorms or rain showers in any of your recovery area.
Very good; thank you.
The items that we still need will be a PRD reading as late as you can do it conveniently prior to a final stowage. And we don't have any numbers on the last crew sleep period. I'd like to verify that the secondary RCS was activated on all four quads. And I have about five comments on the entry checklist procedures to verify.
It was activated on all four quads; that's correct. Our final stowage is completed. We'll read out the PRD's for you now.
Alright. Thank you.
The LMP's reads 0.64; I believe it's been that way throughout the flight. The CMP's reads 0.11, that's 1.11.
Roger.
Stand by a minute. Let me look at it closely. That's 0.11.
Roger. 0.11.
And the one I ended up with reads 3.10.
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. Go ahead, Ken. What else do you want to talk about?
Okay. To make everybody happy, we can use an estimate of the number of hours sleep the people got.
Just a minute, I'll give you that; I forgot. Bill Anders got about 5 hours, and Jim Lovell got about five, and I got about five and a half or six.
Sounds good. Okay. We went through an exercise with the mockup on the preentry preparations, and we noticed that in the LMP's checklist on page S-12, when you go to top off the repress bottles, I believe it is a misprint; it should read the PLSS fill valve rather than the REPRESS valve, and we should be going to the FILL position as opposed to going to ON.
Roger. That's what we do.
Okay. And on - go ahead.
Go ahead. We agree that's what we do.
Okay. On page E-7 of the entry checklist and under step 34, as long as you have panel 382 open, that's a convenient time to go ahead and have the evaporator water controls, both primary and secondary, to AUTO, and the suit heat exchanger for the secondary glycol to FLOW.
Those items are already accomplished.
Very good. On page E-9, when you are getting ready to transfer the RCS to the command module position, if you want to avoid having the engines fire as a result of attitude correction, you might want to take the manual attitude switches to ACCEL COMMAND or MINIMAL IMPULSE. And again on E-9 Alfa at step 41 Bravo, if you want to go back to attitude hold, bring your manual attitude switches back to RATE.
What was that last step?
Step 41 Bravo on page-E-9 Alfa. It's if you decide to use either MINIMAL IMPULSE or ACCEL COMMAND on page E-9, step 41 Bravo would be a good place to go back to RATE COMMAND.
Okay. We do a purge or - -
Okay, fine. And - -
I didn't put all those control configurations changes on the checklist, but that's exactly what we did, used MINIMUM IMPULSE.
Okay. Real fine.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
I'd like to confirm one item on the PAD message, please.
Roger.
Time to retro-drogue|drogues, reference you last time to drogue|drogues, please.
Okay. I'll check that one out.
And also, Ken, we are going to turn on our VHF now, about 4 hours before entry.
Real fine. Thank you. I'll let you know when we pick it up.
A Simplex.
Affirm.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. We have checked into your drogue time, and the number of 08:16 on your entry PAD is correct. We'll be giving you an updated entry PAD on the scheduled time of 143:30. At the same time, we'll be giving you an update of your state vectors for the LM and CSM. The midcourse correction number 7 was less than seven-tenths foot per second, and we will not execute it. You have a P52 scheduled at 143:30 which is not required. It's your option. However, if you decide to delete the P52, the CMC self-check and DSKY condition light test are still requirements. Over.
What do you mean, they are still requirements? We weren't planning to do the CMC self-test.
On that DSKY check . ..
Apollo 8, Houston. That's my mistake on CMC self-check and DSKY condition light. That's an optional test. Over.
That's what we thought, Ken. Gosh, if that's been working perfectly for 6 days, I don't see any reason to test it.
I agree.
Thank you.
Morning, Ken. How's Houston this morning?
Just fine. Nice and balmy.
Good.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, go ahead.
I am just - It is my understanding that we are to bring up the secondary loop at 1 hour prior to SEP, isn't that right?
That is affirmative, about page Echo 9.
Okay.
And Bill, ... suggested if we have the water boiler going on the primary loop, that you - you might wait about 5 minutes or so before you initiate the secondary loop.
Wait 5 minutes from what? From the time the primary loop starts or from 1 hour?
From the time the primary loop starts; this will give you a check to see if it had a chance to dry out or not.
Oh, I am with you. Okay.
And for your information, we already have a VHF downlink. It's poor quality, but we do have contact.
Okay. We haven't turned anything over to VHF yet.
Okay.
We tried to call you on the VHF though, Ken.
Roger. I say, the quality is pretty poor; they may not be able to understand you.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston. Go ahead.
Ken, we got two things going here which make this suit heat exchanger flow a little different. One of them is we are not doing a coldsoak, and the other one is we are powering down the secondary loop prior to SEP. And I wonder if it is a good idea to have the suit heat exchanger only on a secondary loop in that case. And plus the fact that we haven't got any cabin heat exchanger.
I don't think that was the intent, Bill. What they had in mind, we have the suit heat exchanger on both loops; and if they got too cold, you could use the panel switching to shut down the primary loop through the heat exchanger. But in any event, you would always have something going to the suit heat exchanger. I recognize that we are going to be shutting down the secondary heat exchanger pre-SEP and then turning it back on prior to entry, but the idea was to have both primary and secondary loops on the suit heat exchanger simultaneously.
Yes, my checklist doesn't reflect that. I think that's a good idea because we are a little suspect of our cabin fans and don't plan to use them.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Go ahead.
Roger. What's Rod's estimate of our postseparation main bus voltage?
Apollo 8, Houston. We will be making a handover from, Carnarvon to Honeysuckle at 15.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, go ahead.
I am still a little bit confused on that- on this activating the secondary loop. You indicated inactivating it at 1 hour or 5 minutes after the primary evaporator comes on the line. My checklist shows that the primary evaporator probably won't come on the line until we bypass the radiators. Have you got something else in mind I don't know about?
Okay, Bill. We passed up an update some time back on page E-9 step 38 right at the beginning, and you have got a final GET drift check. And between there and the step 39 where it says terminate CM RCS preheat, that was the place we wanted to activate the primary loop by putting the glycol evaporator water switch to AUTO and the glycol evaporator steam pressure to AUTO.
Roger. I don't expect it to boil, though. Do you?
Okay, Bill. We are hoping that it will there. It looks like we will have had a stable attitude for sometime, and we anticipate that it will be warm enough to make it boil. That is the reason it's suggested if it is boiling, that you wait. If it isn't, go ahead and turn on the secondary loop.
Okay. Well, that's where I was confused. I am waking up. Thank you.
Yes, sir.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Apollo 8. We would like to update your LM state vector, CSM state vector, and target point. If it is convenient now, why, we will go ahead and do that if you will go to P00 and ACCEPT.
Roger. P00 and ACCEPT.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay. The loads are in and verified, and the computer is yours.
Okay.
You can take it back to BLOCK, and for Bill's information, latest guess from the main bus post-SEP voltage to 27.5
Guess! You mean the EECOM's are guessing?
At least, they are honest for a change.
That is more than you can say for the computers.
Or the crew.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 8.
Okay, 8. We have an entry PAD for you.
Good. Just a minute.
Ready to copy, Houston.
Okay. This will be the mid-Pacific, 357 152 359 146:29:00 268, plus 0813, minus 16503 065 36221 645 12122 36301 146:46:14 0028. The next block is November Alfa: D<sub>0</sub> 400 02 12 0025 0334 08 14 16 0590 312; Zeta Persei, up 165, right 34, up. Use nonexit EMS pattern, GDC align; primary star Sirius, secondary Rigel, roll 308, pitch 209, yaw 357; this entry will not involve P65. Over.
Houston, Apollo 8. Entry PAD as follows: mid-Pacific, 357 152 359 146:29:30 268 plus 0813 minus 16503 065 36221 645 12122 36301 146:46:14 0028, next block not applicable, 400 0212 0025 0334 0814 16059 312, Zeta Persei, up 165, right 35 up, use nonexit EMS pattern, backup alignment; Sirius, Rigel, roll 308, pitch 209, yaw 357, and we won't need P65.
Okay, Apollo 8. I would like to verify sextant star shaft 0590, and the boresight star.
Roger.
The last one is right 34. Over.
Roger. Boresight star is right 34. And I have the sextant shaft; that's 0590.
That's correct, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Apollo 8. Can you tell us if you've done anything with your potable water? We've noticed our readout has gone from 100 percent down to 56 in the last couple of minutes.
We're reading about 50 percent right now.
Roger. That correlates with what we see. Have you done anything to change configuration? Over.
Yes, we noticed the venting here, too, Houston.
Jim, did you mean you could visually see it?
Yes, we're - oh, stand by, Ken. Bill just dumped urine, so that might have been urine we were seeing.
Bill just shut the potable inlet, Ken.
Okay. Thank you.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, go ahead.
Roger, Houston. We're still showing about 52 percent, and we had our switch on waste so we don't know whether it dropped from a higher value or not. Has yours been stabilized now?
That's affirmative; ours has stabilized now. It was reading full just a few minutes ago.
Roger. I don't think - we can't account for any sudden drop in water.
Okay. We looked in the malfunction procedures, and number 28 doesn't reveal anything very startling.
Bill is looking there now.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, 8.
Okay. I'm looking at malfunction 28, and it takes you to box 6, but I don't really think that's the problem because the waste tank quantity hasn't changed any. Over.
Okay. I concur. We're watching the same thing.
Look, we don't care about the potable tank, but we do about the waste tank, so just in case there is a problem somewhere, I'm going to shut the potable tank off and leave the waste tank inlet valve open. How does that sound to you?
Stand by. Okay, 8. We concur.
If I see any water floating around, I'll give you another call.
Roger. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Radio check.
Read you loud and clear.
Roger. We had a momentary loss of COMM on the ground then. Read you loud and clear.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Houston, Apollo 8. Did you call?
Apollo 8, Houston. You are loud and clear. We've taken a look at this water - -
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. Read you loud and clear. We have taken a look at your potable water quantity problem, and it appears to be a transducer problem. Suggest that you leave the potable tank isolated. You have sufficient water in the waste tank to continue the entry. Over.
Roger. Thank you, Houston.
Does that mean we're GO for entry?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, go ahead.
Roger. Is our thermal stability good enough we can leave the PTC attitude and go to entry gimbal angles now?
Houston, how do you read? Apollo 8.
Read you loud and clear, Apollo 8, and we're checking on the PTC problem now.
Apollo 8, Houston. You are cleared with entry attitude at this time.
Okay. Fine. Thank you.
Houston voice. Go to voice 925.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Apollo 8, loud and clear. Go.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, go ahead.
Roger. We have completed the checklist down to the 1-hour point, and we'll stand by for 1 hour.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Just for information, did you folks end up having to use any command module RCS heaters?
Negative. All our indicators are pegged either high or at 5 volt.
Okay. Thank you.
Carnarvon, network GOSS conference voice check. How do you read?
Network, Carnarvon. Read you weak but clear.
Roger, Carnarvon. I read you loud and clear.
You are loud and clear now. Thank you.
Apollo 8, Houston. Stand by for hand over to Carnarvon.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay, Apollo 8. If you will go to P00 and ACCEPT, we would like to update your LM and CSM state vectors. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. State vector load is complete. Verify the computer is yours.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. State vector load is complete; the computer is yours.
Roger, Houston. We are going to BLOCK.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Okay. Two fast items: number one, it has been suggested that since Marezine takes some time to take effect, you might consider whether you would be interested in taking some now. And I have an entry PAD which has some very small updates to go on it if you would like to copy that.
Okay. Stand by. Let me get out the entry PAD.
Okay. Go ahead with the entry PAD, Houston.
Okay. We are still going to the mid-Pacific, 357 152 359 146:29:13 267, plus 0813, minus 16503 066 36221 647 12166 36301 146:46:13 0028, the next block is November Alfa, V<sub>0</sub> 400 0210 0025 0335 0816 160590 312; Zeta Persei, up 165, right 34, up nonexit EMS pattern; Sirius and Rigel, roll 308, pitch 209, yaw 357, no P65 involved. Over.

Apollo 8, Houston. You are clear to initiate cabin coldsoak at your discretion. Over.
Roger, Houston. We're starting that now.
... your mike is stuck.
You have a hot mike, Houston.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, 8.
Okay. It doesn't appear that we are going to be able to trigger the primary evaps, so I'm going to go ahead and start up the secondary loop.
Okay, Apollo 8. We concur.
Houston, Apollo 8.
Go ahead, 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, go ahead.
Roger. Since we're going as smoothly as we are here - we've got good COMM - let's start this pyro circuit check about 10 minutes early. What do you say?
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. We can conduct the pyro check just any time.
All right. Why don't we do it here just momentarily then?
Roger.
We'll give you a call when we're ready.
Roger.
Houston, we are ready to proceed with the pyro circuit check.
Roger. Go ahead.
MSFN, are you monitoring the sequential test now?
Houston, Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. That's affirmative.
Hello, Houston. Apollo 8.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Loud and clear. Affirmative we are monitoring.
Okay.
Standing by for GO and PYRO ARM.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. You have a GO.
Roger.
Houston, this is Apollo 8; How is your tracking looking?
Looking great.
Okay. Everything went fine with the check. We are all armed and ready to go here.
Okay. If you have done everything else, how about let's make a VHF check.
Okay. I'll turn off my S-band; the other two will be on S-band.
Roger. I'll give you a count in just a second.
Apollo 8, Houston. Simultaneous VHF and S-band. Over.
Roger. I'm not reading you on VHF.
Roger. Stand by one.
Apollo 8, Houston. Simultaneous VHF and S-band. Do you verify that you are on the left hand VHF antenna? Over.
We can verify the antenna, but we can't verify reading you on S-band or on VHF.
Okay. We are receiving some downlink, although it is considered to be poor quality.
Apollo 8, Houston. We'd like to try the right VHF antenna, if you have time.
We're - we're on right, Ken.
Okay. This is a simultaneous VHF and S-band transmission: one, two, three, four, five. How do you read on VHF? Over.
Read you loud and clear.
Understand that's on VHF. Is that affirm?
Houston, this is Apollo 8. I answered your call on VHF. Did you receive?
Okay. It's not piped back here. MOKR'll have to check and see if they have it on the ground station.
You were loud and clear, Ken.
Roger. Thank you.
Okay, Apollo 8. We receive you loud and clear on VHF through Carnarvon.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. Stand by for handover from Carnarvon to Guam on the hour. We should have continuous contact except for the blackout period beginning at 146:51.
Roger.
Houston, Apollo 8. Confirm GO for PYRO ARM.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, Houston. You are GO for PYRO ARM.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. You are GO for PYRO ARM. Everything is looking good.
Roger. Everything is looking good here, Ken.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. It appears that your primary evaporator may have dried out. If you get a chance, go ahead and give it a try to reservice. Over.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Ground data indicates the primary evaporator may have dried out. If you have a chance, you might try reservicing. Over.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8. Your secondary loop looks good.
Roger, Houston.
Apollo 8, Houston. Looking good; both primary and secondary loops look good.
Apollo 8, through the Redstone. You're looking good; both primary and secondary loops are holding good.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, through Redstone. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. This is Apollo 8.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. You're looking good.
Roger.
Apollo 8, Houston. One minute to RRT.
Roger.
Good point too.
Apollo 8, Houston. Radio check.
Apollo 8, Houston through Huntsville. Over.
Apollo 8, Apollo 8, this is Houston through ARIA. Say again, 8.
Houston, Apollo 8. Over.
Go ahead, Apollo 8. Read you broken and loud.
We've got a real fireball. It's looking good.
Outstanding!
We are in real good shape, Houston.
Real fine.
Apollo 8, Houston. Yorktown has radar on you.
Apollo 8, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
If you get a chance, we'd like to have your DSKY readings before drogue|drogues.
Stand by.
Roger. DSKY reading plus four balls 7, plus two balls 812, minus 16522.
... This is Apollo 8. Over.
The spacecraft is down to 1000.
Be ready for code 3.
Yorktown, Rec 3. At this time, the command module is in the water. Over.
Roger.
Bolts and lift-off.
Roger. Clock is started.
There's the roll program.
Roger. Roll.
Okay. Roll is completed.
Roger. Roll Complete.
There goes the pitch.
Roger. Pitch. you're on your way, Molly Brown.
Yeah man!
Plus 50 seconds.
Roger. Mode II delay.
Roger.
Cabin pressure is holding at 6.0, climbing just a little.
Roger.
It just got quiet.
Roger.
Cabin pressure relieving at 6.5.
1 + 40.
Roger. Mode II.
Roger.
First DCS update received.
Roger. Update.
You're a little bit high on the flight path, but no problem, Molly Brown.
Okay, Molly Brown's GO for staging.
Roger. Looks good from here.
Roger.
Second update received.
Roger. Update.
Okay, there was staging.
Roger. Stage.
And, we're thrusting.
Okay. Thrust looks good from here.
FDI shows full scale pitch attitude error.
Okay. We're starting to steer.
Horizon comes right into view.
Roger.
RGS is GO!
Looks good from here.
Oh, man! Look at that horizon.
Steering is good from here.
Hey, we're moving right along that horizon.
Roger.
What did you say, Gordo?
Pretty big throttle you got there, huh?
Yes.
Roger. Molly Brown you're GO from here.
Roger. Molly Brown is GO.
Roger.
Steering right down the old line.
Okay.
Yeah, you can see the view real well. The nose dropped below the horizon a little bit. now it's back up above.
Roger. Stand by for my mark on 0.8.
Roger.
MARK 0.8.
Good show.
Roger.
Looks good.
SECO.
Roger. You are GO, Molly Brown.
One seven.
Roger.
Okay. We are separated.
Roger. Fairings.
There went all fairings.
Okay, fine.
You have the IVI's?
Okay. 17 ft/sec at SECO, and I have 29 ft/sec now.
Roger. 23 down?
That's 3 down, 7 right.
Roger. 3 down, 7 right.
And 29 aft. Right.
And 23 aft. Okay.
And the attitude on the ball is 18° nose down.
Roger. We have an 87 by 125 orbit, Molly Brown.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Roger. You have an 87 by 125 orbit. I'll get you One-Alpha shortly.
Roger.
Roger. new One-Alpha time is elapsed time of 18:12. 18 minutes, 12 seconds.
Roger. 18:12.
Roger. Write fast, John.
That horizon is right where they said it would be.
Yes.
Let's see, have we got everything on this checklist, John? Let's see—retrorockets safe. Yes.
Yes.
OAMS power— ATTITUDE.
Maneuver controller—stowed. Sequence lights—test.
Arm restraints, face plates—open.
Secondary O<sub>2</sub> bottle is closed. I've got mine. Waste valve to NORMAL.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
GO, Cape CAP COM.
Look better there than on a ballistic flight?
Say again.
Does it look better from there than on a ballistic flight?
I can't read you, Gordo.
Roger. How-do-it-look?
It look great!
Rog.
Computer—PRELAUNCH. High frequency is off. Antenna selector to ADAPTER.
Cape CAP COM, how do you read on adapter antenna? Over.
Cape CAP COM, Molly Brown. Over.
Maybe we lost 'em.
Yes.
Man, it's hard to watch that gyro.
Yes.
Guess you've got to stow the drogue pins, huh?
Yes. Stow those drogue pins.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Cape CAP COM, Molly Brown. How do you read?
Cape CAP COM, Molly Brown. How do you read?
Better go to reentry antenna.
Okay.
Cape CAP COM, how do you read Molly Brown?
I think we've lost them now. let's leave it on adapter antenna and we'll try at Canaries.
Okay.
Let's get lined up here.
I'll put the mains to OFF and see what we've got. Look here, we've still got a … I want to put these off. I'll put them off one at a time, or we may drop voltage.
What's our time coming in to the Canaries?
Time is 14 something. Just a second. Okay, Canary is 14:50 acquisition. LOS 21:42.
Okay.
I'd say I was alined pretty good, wouldn't you?
Yes.
Great!
Shoot, Gus, I can't get my blood pressure bulb in. I really can't.
It wants to keep yawing us all the time.
Huh?
It wants to keep yawing us all the time.
Yes.
We must have a leak.
What kind of leak?
Okay.
You want the plotboard?
Yes.
If I can get it out.
The intercom is noisy, isn't it?
I can't get the plotboard out of there.
I can't get it out, John.
Can't get the plotboard out?
I'll darn sure never get it in. Oh yes, there it comes.
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM. How do you read?
Canary CAP COM, this is Molly Brown. how do you read?
Roger. Read you loud and clear, Molly Brown.
I read you the same.
We have your T/M solid and all systems look good on the ground.
Okay, we look pretty good up here.
I have your 2-1 time if you are ready to copy. Do you copy, Molly Brown?
Okay.
Okay. Ready with 2-1.
Roger. ΔV139. GMTRC 15 55 47. GETRC 01 31 47. Roll left 55°. GMTRB 16 05 31. Roll right 65. Did you copy?
Did you get 'em?
Yes.
There goes a planet up there.
Did you get 'em?
Roger.
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM.
We're getting ready to read them back to you.
Roger.
Roger. ΔV of 139. GMT of 16-belay that—15 55 47.
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM. Request you place your radiator switch to the FLOW position.
Roger. Radiator is in FLOW position. Has been the whole pass.
It's cooling us right down too. It's working.
Reading back a GMT of 2-1—15 55 47 GMTRC. GMTRB is 16 05 31. Bank angle 55° left and right 65°.
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM. We are standing by for your UHF Com Check. Do you copy?
Roger. We are on UHF #2. Have been the whole pass. Over. _comment: Pilot was in RECORD on No. 2 audio
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead.
I don't think they read me.
Roger. We are standing by for your UHF Com Check, and would you place your radiator switch to your FLOW position?
Roger. John has been answering all of those. He's just in RECORD.
Roger. The radiator has been in FLOW the whole pass. The UHF has been on No. 2 the whole pass. over.
Roger. Copy you loud and clear, Molly Brown. We are standing by for your blood pressure.
Roger. Blood pressure is coming down.
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM. Be advised, on your 15 second burn you achieved a 12.6 ft/sec. Did you copy?
Roger. Understand. I seem to have a leak. There must be a leak in one of the thrusters, because I get a continuous yaw left.
Roger. Understand that you get a continuous yaw left.
Very slight. Very slow drift.
Roger.
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM. I have your radiator temperatures, if you are ready to copy.
Roger.
Roger. your radiator outlet temperature if off-scale high. Your radiator inlet is 74.
Roger. Off-scale high. Going back to BY-PASS on radiator.
Roger. Understand.
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM. Stand by to start your clock at 20 minutes ground elapsed time. On my mark.
MARK! Did you copy, Molly Brown?
Roger. I copied, and sea urchin eggs activated.
Roger.
Be advised we have received your blood pressure, Molly Brown.
Roger.
Radiator outlet temperature is off-scale high and Greenwich Mean Time is 1445.
Rate Command looks good.
Okay. The control checks are completed.
Do you still read, Canaries?
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM.
Roger. Control checks are completed and insertion checklist is completed too.
Roger. Understand.
I've been advised from the Cape you might put your prop switch off and recycle a couple of times, and it might stop your leak.
It's not leaking.
Did you copy Molly Brown?
I copied.
Here, Gus, let me get your drogue pin in.
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM. Do you copy?
Say again.
Roger. Can we have your sea urchin egg time again, please?
Roger. 20 minutes elapsed.
Roger. Understand.
We are over Africa, John.
Yes.
I knew I wouldn't get these pins stowed until we were over Kano.
There's all kinds of junk floating around in here.
Man, I agree!
If you'll give me the camera, I'll take a couple of pictures.
Okay. The waste valve is in NORMAL.
We've got a scanner ignore. Wonder what caused that. Hey, we're pitching over and there's nothing I can do about it.
Scanner ignore is driving you?
Yes.
Oh, I know what it was. My knee was hitting the control stick, wasn't it?
No, I don't think so. That would only be in Pulse anyway.
We've got to get this pressure back up.
Do we have a leak?
It's this event they were talking about. _comment: Unexplained cryogenic pressure decay on GT-2
Let's see.
Look at the cabin pressure!
What?
We've lost the —.
Lost what? What have we lost?
Lost a primary converter.
Really?
Yes.
I'll get that heater off.
Okay, I'll get the mains back off.
Are you sure you didn't bump the converter to the OFF position?
That switch way up there?
No, you couldn't, could you?
No.
Want to try it back on the primary and see what happens?
That's how we lost it. Yes.
See? _comment: Noted that primary dc-dc converter was still inoperative
Yes.
Okay.
Okay. That did it.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
How's that circuit breaker set-up up there?
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
…
Yep.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Cape CAP COM, Molly Brown here.
Roger. How's your status on that thruster?
It's still GO. We're still drifting a little bit, Gordo. It's not bad. I can hold it with Pulse with no problem. But we did lose our primary dc-dc converter.
Roger. Lost your primary dc-dc.
Roger.
Roger.
That must not have been the scanner problem though.
Have you tried your circuit breaker, Gus, on that?
Yes, we have.
Molly Brown, have you tried your circuit breaker to cut off that one erratic thruster.
Negative.
I don't know which one it is. Let's see—yaw left—
Yaw left. It would be either OAMS No. 7 or 8.
We're not getting any roll with it.
It really is pitching up, isn't it?
Yes, but it's stopping.
That stopped it, all right.
Yes.
I turned the auto heater back on.
I should turn that off till the cryo pressure comes down.
Flight control loss.
Now it's drifting us the other way.
It's hard to see in here, isn't it?
Can't pull it off? Can't you get it off?
What time is it now?
32 elapsed.
We're just about over … Africa.
Over where?
We'll cross the east coast of Africa here before long.
Hand me one of those towels over there in your box, will you?
Okay. Are they on top?
No, they're back in the back.
Hey! We're coming in on the night side.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Look at that night come up.
Molly Brown, Cap CAP COM.
I ready you okay, Gordo. How do you read Molly Brown?
Roger. How's your control system?
Cape CAP COM. How do you read Molly Brown?
I'm reading you weak but readable.
Yes, you are almost unreadable.
Say again, Molly Brown.
I said I can read you, Gordo.
Roger, I'm barely reading you also.
How - is - your - control - system? Over.
That stuff goes right on by us.
Yes.
Okay. That's right. Now I've got the suit closed.
There is lightning out there.
Yep.
Look at that stuff going by. Oh boy! Really does sparkle doesn't it?
Yes.
Now you can see those thrusters firing back there.
Now you give this blood pressure, don't you?
I'll give it. You want me to give it?
It says you do.
It says Command—Oh! Oral temperature.
Oh, I mean oral temp, John. Can you get the thermometer out?
Yes.
I can't get the blood pressure bulb in.
Maybe you are pushing it in the wrong end.
Oh.
Okay. We're back to NORMAL on the waste valve.
How can you tell the difference between the ends?
All I know is it won't insert in one end, and it does insert with the other. I never saw a blood pressure bulb like that before this flight.
Look at that! It's beautiful!
There's the Southern Cross and Alpha and Beta Centuri.
Are those thrusters firing?
Yes.
I'm doing it.
Oh, you doing it?
Yes, we are yawing. I've got to keep it from yawing so far around.
Going to do this O<sub>2</sub> —
Want me to put it back in and give them a blood pressure?
If you can get it in. I can't.
What time is it?
41 elapsed. I get CSQ at 42:19.
Okay.
About another minute.
Going back to No. 1 on the UHF.
Going back to No. 1 on the UHF at elapsed time of 42.
There's no horizon out there at all.
Molly Brown, Molly Brown, CSQ CAP COM.
CSQ, this is Molly Brown.
Roger. how is your control system working?
Well, the control system is working fine. It's just that I have a very slight yaw to the left.
Molly Brown, I copy you very weak. Would you say again?
All the control system is working fine. We just have a very slight drift to the left.
Roger. Understand. Would you confirm that you are on secondary dc-to-dc converter?
Affirmative.
Are you on secondary ACME yaw logic?
Should we try that?
Yes.
Molly Brown, CSQ CAP COM. Are you in the FLOW position on the radiator?
Radiator is in FLOW position. We're trying secondary ACME yaw logic now.
Roger.
I don't know where I'm going to put this.
Does it have urine in it?
No, there isn't anything in it. it's air in it. I'm supposed to fit it into the aft food box.
Puncture it if it's just air.
Well, that's a thought.
CSQ, Molly Brown.
Molly Brown, CSQ CAP COM.
Roger. Unable to send a blood pressure. The bulb won't fit in the suit hole anymore.
Roger. Cape recommends that you place the driver switch to SECONDARY.
Roger.
Molly Brown, CSQ CAP COM.
Go ahead CSQ.
Your inlet temp: 76°. Your outlet temp: 42°.
Roger.
We'll stay in FLOW.
That secondary driver may have stopped the drift.
Molly Brown, CSQ.
Go ahead.
We have not received a blood pressure or an oral temp.
Roger. I told you the blood pressure bulb won't fit in the hole anymore. I think the "O" Ring is jammed, or something.
Roger. We're standing by for respirator maneuver.
Okay. Here it comes.
Okay. How about this? No. 2 audio in UHF and T/M CALIBRATE —
Molly Brown, CSQ. Stand by for a GMT time hack.
Roger.
On my mark GMT will be 15 11 10.
MARK!
Molly Brown, CSQ.
Roger your mark. My watch is 10 seconds fast.
Roger.
Have you received oral temp yet?
Molly Brown, CSQ.
Go ahead CSQ.
We copied your respiratory maneuver, and we have your oral temp. All systems appear GO from the ground.
Molly Brown, Molly Brown, Carnarvon CAP COM. How do you read?
Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Read you the same. Could you give us your status please? And the cape would like to know if any of the remedies helped your yaw problem.
No. None of the remedies helped and we are GO.
Okay. You have a GO from down here for the second orbit, and, if you'll stand by, I'll send you a 2-1 T<sub>R</sub> and a Gemini load.
Roger.
Stand by for T<sub>R</sub>.
You ready?
Yes.
Okay, Molly Brown. We got your Gemini load. We could not get T<sub>R</sub> in. We got a spacecraft reject on T<sub>R</sub>, and it did go in at this time.  I'd like to give you a hack on T<sub>R</sub> at 39:30, in about 10 seconds.
You're going to punch it, aren't you?
Yes.
Molly Brown, stand by on my mark.
MARK! 39:30 is your T<sub>R</sub>. Your T<sub>R</sub> clock is synched with all on the ground, and your spacecraft elapsed time is synched.
Okay. We have computer time of 39:28. That's close enough.
Roger, and I believe I see a light from Perth.
Roger. I understand you see light from Perth. We'll have a radiator status for you in a minute, and anytime you can give your GMT for your experiment, I'd appreciate it.
Roger. The GMT of that Blood Experiment —
The elapsed time of the Blood Experiment was 50 minutes and 18 seconds. That was elapsed time.
Roger. 50 minutes and 18 seconds. Your radiator - in is 73, your rad-out is 38. You're looking pretty good.
Roger.
And if John is ready to copy any of this maneuver load, I have it for you.
All set.
He's ready to copy.
Okay. GMTB 15 43 23. ΔV of 139. Duration of burn - 2 minutes 39 seconds. Your GMTRC 15 55 24. Roll left 55.  GMTRB 16 05 28.  Roll right 65.  GMT 400 K 15 58 23.  Your maneuver load:  6344257, 0444775, 0533348, 664903.3, 676628.4, 082244.4, 09120.50, 10031.38, 11302.00.
Roger. Copied your parameters. Over.
Molly Brown, Carnarvon here. You can go secondary coolant loop OFF, and you can go evaporator to NORMAL.
Roger. Secondary coolant loop OFF and evaporator to NORMAL.
Molly Brown, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead.
Roger. Your Texas burn will be 48 ft/sec for 73 seconds.
Okay, 48 ft/sec for 73 seconds.
That's affirmative. We got your T<sub>R</sub> and Gemini load in. Your clocks look good on the ground, and everything is GO here. See you next trip.
Roger.
Let's get back on RECORD.
Okay.
On the OAMS thruster check, the fire is red in streaks. When the yaw thrusters fire it definitely wipes out the horizon. Can see the horizon all right through the pitch thrusters.
Oh, that's lovely.
Huh?
I wouldn't believe it if it hadn't happened.
What?
I got my left shoulder harness tangled up in the backboard.
Oh, Oh.
Had to turn around to get it out.
Hey, I think our yaw drift has stopped.
We're down to 2400. That's pretty good. _comment: OAMS pressure
Is that okay?
Yes, that's fine. It means we haven't used any OAMS fuel.
Elapsed time is 1:05. Now, I'm going to get a main batteries check. _comment: Pilot misread elapsed time
—9½ and 24 on one and 9½ and 24 on two, and 9½ and 24 on three. 9½ and 24 on four. Those mains are good!
What time is it now, Gus?
It's 63 minutes.
63. Okay.
Look at that thing. I don't know what we can do with any of this stuff floating around. Do you?
No, I don't either. We need a special place to keep that stuff.
I'll put it in my pocket.
Okay. I'll verify that load. _comment: Pre-retro command load
Is the T<sub>R</sub>-5 circuit breaker off?
Yes.
Okay.
You don't see many stars. You know that?
We have a scanner ignore light again. Aren't losing those gages again, are we?
No.
All of our power is okay?
Yep.
Must have been our scanners, I guess.
204. This is just beautiful, Gus! It checks to the digit! _comment: Pre-retro command load
Hey, we ought to have our face plates closed.
Okay.
Cabin Air Recirculation Valve-UP. That's where it is.
Huh?
It says Cabin Air Recirc Valve UP. That's where it is.
Yes. Faceplates closed or open?
Closed.
Okay.
Now we have a Catch-Up Mode Check.
Okay.
Now?
Well, yes. Now.
Okay.
Hey, there was lightning down below.
You want to go to CATCH-UP?
Yes.
In CATCH-UP. That right?
Yes.
Hey. I'm not in CATCH-UP yet. There's CATCH-UP.
Okay. I scratched this one out.
Okay.
You want to punch it in?
It's punched.
Okay, I'll start the computer.
50 - 30 - 40.
How about that? Just what it's supposed to be.
Roger. Just what it's supposed to be.
Pitch down.
Yes.
Okay, 56 is 20094, 57 is 19280.
Cabin pressure is reading 5.2, isn't it?
Yes, it's holding.
50 - 30 - 40. Those readings are right. You get 56?
Yes, 56 and 57 are right on the money. I copied them.
Okay, there it is — 10 - 20 - 30.
Okay, what time is it now?
70 minutes.
Huh?
Elapsed time of 70 minutes.
How many?
70.
Right now?
1:10. Yes.
Okay, at 70:18 give it to me.
MARK!
Okay, Blood Experiment deactivated.
Okay, that's exactly — that's 39° pitched down.
Okay, and you've got the sea urchin eggs coming up at 1:15, too.
Okay.
Pulse control is real good.
Yes.
It sure lights up all around though, doesn't it?
Sure does.
Okay, we're just about to get it all in one window.
Okay.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Okay, reading on the Catch-Up mode Check was 69 000 00.
Cape CAP COM, Molly Brown. Go ahead.
Roger, Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM. We're going to have you leave your propellant switch on and do the Texas burn, and we will watch your fuel usage then across the States. If it continues, we'll have you turn your propellant switches off, then, when you're over the Cape next time, except when you need to use the fuel.
Leave the propellant switch on for the Texas burn, and then watch for leakage?
Roger. Leave it on till after the Texas burn, and then we will watch your leakage. If it continues to leak, we will have you turn them off over the Cape.
Roger. We can't tell that we're using any fuel.
Okay, fine. We are not overly concerned. It's just that we'd like to get a handle on what is causing it here.
Your O<sub>2</sub> pressure is off the scale on the high side by telemetry.
Say again, Gordo.
Your oxygen pressure, your O<sub>2</sub> pressure, is off the high side of the scale. You may have had that switch failure in there. you may have had a telemetry failure in there that failed to the high side.
Roger. We'll go to High Rate and see if it comes down, Gordo.
Roger, and Gordo we have lost our primary scanners.
Roger. Did you say primary scanners?
Affirmative.
Okay. Can you give us a helium source pressure?
Say again.
What is your helium source pressure?
Roger. It's 2350, Gordo.
Look at the sunrise.
Yes.
Our source pressure is 2350, Gordo.
Let's see if I can bring that pressure down, using O<sub>2</sub> High Rate, if it is all right with you, Gus.
Okay.
We can try manual actuation of O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. I never did the Suit Integrity Check.
We probably drove it overboard using that heater switch when we thought the pressure was down.
Yes. That's right.
We have got to get ready for this Texas burn.
Yes.
What time is that Texas burn?
1:33.
1:33.
Now see, it is coming down. _comment: oxygen pressure
Okay.
Now, we'll just recock it.
That was O<sub>2</sub> High Rate for about two minutes to bring the pressure off the peg. it's now reading 985, and cabin pressure is holding at 5.6.
Here comes the sunrise. Is that beautiful!
Isn't that pretty?
Aren't you going to take any pictures?
I hadn't planned to on this pass. I'll get the camera out.
Let's see, I want circuit breakers 9 and 10 off, don't I?
Yes. That sun's bright, isn't it?
Look at that! Where do you suppose that came from? _comment: A camera reel
What?
I know you shouldn't let those things float around, but I don't know what to do with them.
What did he say that burn was on that … net? It's 48 ft —
48 feet and 73 seconds.
Okay. you put that in, don't you?
Yes.
Do I have to be in CATCH-UP when you put it in?
What?
Do I have to be in CATCH-UP when you put it in?
For me to enter it, yes. I'll just put in on the MDIU indicators here.
Looks like the velocity is about perfect. You can really tell you're moving on. You know that?
You sure can!
I can see some interesting cloud formations down there.
We'll be coming up for Guaymas, I guess, next.
Okay, what elapsed time are we in the flight plan, Gus?
1:19
1:19
RKV we get at 1:24.
Okay.
I'd say my alinement is perfect.
Okay. That's what we want to burn. I've got to change this tape cartridge. The camera is set for f11 at 250.
The first command load is valid. The DCS at Carnarvon inserted it properly.
Okay.
That's beautiful!
I'll bet the debris filter really clogs up.
What?
The oxygen pressure has climbed right up back there off-scale.
What is?
The oxygen pressure.
I've got to change this cartridge.
We're at 1:21.
Tape change at 1546. Tape cartridge No. 2 was replaced by tape cartridge No. 28.
The red light did not come on. _comment: Tape recorder
Molly Brown, Molly Brown, RKV.
RKV, this is Molly Brown.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. I'm going to update your T<sub>R</sub> and transmit a maneuver load to you.
Roger.
I've got a reject on my T<sub>R</sub>. What is your status, Molly Brown?
Do you want me to tell them about the oxygen pressure being off-scale?
Our status is GO. We did bring the ECS O<sub>2</sub> back down on the scale with O<sub>2</sub> High Rate, and since that time it has returned to off-scale.
Roger, and I have transmitted a T<sub>R</sub> and Gemini load for your maneuver over Corpus. Confirm you were in CATCH-UP. Over.
Negative. We're in CATCH-UP, now.
Roger. I'll retransmit the load.
Roger. You have a load in the CATCH-UP for your maneuver.
Got to be in CATCH-UP.
Okay. There you go.
Roger. Go.
You are GO for the next orbit.
Roger. Thank you.
Are you ready to copy your maneuver times?
Stand by.
Roger.
You ready?
Yes.
Okay. We're ready to copy.
Roger. Your GMTB…correction, 15 57 00. Your ground elapsed time to burn, 01 33 00. Your ΔV of the burn, 048. Your length of burn, 01:14.
Roger. We copied 15:57, 01:33, 48ft/sec, at a minute and 14 seconds.
74 seconds.
Well, 1 minute 14. You want to read it back to them?
Did you get him the other one?
Neg. Wait until I'll get them.
Roger. Stand by for a GET time hack.
On my mark, it'll be 85 minutes and 45 seconds. Stand by.
MARK! You copied?
Roger. We copied.
Roger. Your clocks looked good on the ground.
Will you give me a readout of core 25, 26, and 27? Over.
26 and 27 are all zeros.
I wonder if he got it?
I don't know.
Molly Brown, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead. Over.
Go ahead RKV.
Will you give me a readout of your computer core — 25, 26, and 27, please?
Roger. It was: 25 was minus 0480. 26 and 27 were all zeros. Over.
That is affirmative. I concur.
Molly Brown, can you give me a readout of your OAMS helium source pressure, temperature, and your propellant quantity gage.
The propellant quantity gage is 83 percent. Stand by. John will give you the other.
Roger. Source pressure is 2450. Source temperature is 85°, and fuel and oxidizer regulated at 295 with 68°.
Roger. 295 at 68. Say again your propellant quantity, Command Pilot.
Propellant quantity is 84 percent.
Roger. I copy.
Molly Brown, RKV standing by. Do you have anything else?
Roger. We're in good shape.
Roger.
Molly Brown, RKV. I'm getting an indication of OAMS thrust forward-firing. I have negative OAMS yaw firing on the ground.
We're not doing any firing. We're not even in MANEUVER and ATTITUDE and we haven't touched the handle.
Roger.
Molly Brown, stand by for Guaymas.
Roger.
Outstanding! I see the whole of Mexico.
I wonder what area of Mexico it is?
Molly Brown, Guaymas CAP COM.
Guaymas, Molly Brown.
Guaymas standing by.
Roger.
It's pretty well clobbered, isn't it?
Yes.
We're going to have a hard time with that tracking task.
Can you see anything up north there?
I never got a chance to look for the Salton Sea, but I think we can see up that way.
Nothing but high cirrus.
Oh, man! Oh, man, you can see all the way across Mexico!
You must have it clear down there, huh?
Yes, it's clear down south, here.
Molly Brown, Guaymas handing over to Texas.
Roger.
It came out 50 feet on my IVI's. You'll give me a mark now on my burn. Right?
Roger.
Okay. It will be about two minutes before we start it. So you punch off your stopwatch and tell me — give me a mark to stop it—just in case it doesn't go to zero.
Okay.
Molly Brown, Texas CAP COM.
Read you loud and clear, Texas.
Roger. Texas standing by for your maneuver.
Roger.
You got that? The IVI's came out 50 ft/sec aft. Right?
Yes, but it should have been 48. I don't know why it came out to 50. Should we bring it down to 48?
Well 25—48 is what is in the—48.3 is what's in the load.
How we doing on time?
Fine.
Well, good. I guess maybe we probably slowed down that much.
Now, it's 51. See?
It came up 48 initially. We're at a different place in the orbit. 30 seconds.
Okay. Are you going to give—you want me to give Texas a mark when you start burning?
I will.
Okay.
Twenty seconds to burn. You got that, Texas?
Roger.
Okay. 3 seconds.
MARK!
Okay. They appear to be firing good.
Roger. Texas confirms OAMS thruster firing.
A bolt just stuck up against the instrument panel.
How much time to go?
Molly Brown, how are your attitudes holding?
Perfect.
44 seconds to go.
Roger.
MARK. 44 seconds to go.
I think I'd do it on the IVI's.
They sure blurp a lot, don't they? That may be attitude control thrusters though. Probably what it is.
Okay.
Coming up on - coming up on a minute.
MARK.
7 ft/sec to go.
A minute, five.
What did we do? Burn down an—give me a mark.
Okay. 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 -
MARK!
Thrusting complete.
Roger. Confirmed maneuver complete.
That burn was 1 minute and 14 seconds by our watches.
And when we started out, the IVI's were reading 51 ft/sec, and I burned them down to 2 ft/sec aft.
Say again, Molly Brown.
As we started to burn my IVI's read 51 ft/sec, and we burned them down to the place where they read 2 ft/sec.
Say again that last number.
Two. Zero, zero, two.
Roger.
What have you got on your propellant, Gus?
Propellant quantity is 65 percent.
Hey, we're in good shape.
Yes.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Go ahead, Gordo.
Roger. Do you want to get your transmitter up to start your tape dump?
Yes, it's on. The transmitter is now DELAYED-TIME.
Ready for your tape dump?
Understand. Going tape playback CONTINUOUS.
Tape playback is on CONTINUOUS.
Okay, Molly Brown. Looks like your OAMS has leveled out before your burn. Can you give us an OAMS source pressure and temp again now?
Roger. Source pressure is 2050, temperature is 56.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Oh, that record switch!
This source pressure is 2050. Source temperature is 56.
Roger. it looks like that pressure switch on that O<sub>2</sub> is failed. You probably better bring that O<sub>2</sub> heater from AUTOMATIC to OFF, and then manually control the temp from then on—the pressure from then on.
If I go into High Rate you can break it off the peg. Over.
Okay, you can bring it off the peg by going to High Rate. Is that affirm?
Roger, but—
Okay. I have a time for you, where you will be nearest to the booster. Would you like to have that so you can look for it?
Roger.
Roger. 02 + 08 + 52. Will be dead ahead at an elevation of plus 80° at 190 miles. This will be just prior to darkness. It should be very bright. Proceed to see if you can rendezvous.
Roger.
We are sending you a load now.
Roger, DCS load received.
Roger. We got you loaded.
We had another DCS load just in, too.
Roger. That was the actual values. The first one was the T<sub>R</sub>.
Roger.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM. Did you get your experiments for the first orbit?
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Go ahead Cape CAP COM.
Roger. We just wanted to get a confirmation that you got your experiments on time for the first orbit.
Roger. We got them on time for the first orbit.
Roger.
Everything looks good down here.
Roger.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM. Our memory loads on the ground confirm your loads were correct in there, so you might delete all the MDIU readouts.
Okay.
Here is the blood pressure coming down there, MCC.
Okay.
Tape dump is complete, Molly Brown.
Rog.
You still got a blood pressure, John? We didn't read it.
He sent it, okay. I'll give you another one.
Okay. Just wondered if he was breathing.
Gordo, do you have me a time for the Horizon Scan Check?
Cape CAP COM, do you read, Molly Brown.
Go ahead Molly Brown. Cape CAP COM.
Do you have me a time for the Horizon Scanner Check?
Okay, sunset time is 16 + 34. Stand by, and I will get you the horizon scanner.
1634.
That is the time for it, Molly Brown. 16 + 34.
Thanks.
Pretty spectacular up there, huh?
Say again.
Pretty spectacular up there, huh?
Yeah, it really is. It really is!
We didn't get to see much of the States though.
Clouded over? Too many clouds, huh?
Let's see, do you want your meal?
Yes.
Is this one all right?
Yes, this is the one here.
You can't get the bulb in, huh? How about if I just leave it in and give them blood pressures.
Yes, go ahead.
I can't get it in.
Hot dog! Good old food.
Going to have to make Alinement Check.
Want to just slap those babies over there?
They said to leave the brownies closed.
Okay, starting Alinement Caging Check. Minus 10° in pitch, 10° in yaw, and 10° in roll. Going to CAGE, small-end-forward, holding attitudes out the window. Okay, I've caged. Going SEF, platform and attitude. Fine aline from 1:45 to 1:55.
Let me have some of that juice when you get done.
Get any water?
Good stuff! _comment: Water
You want me to stick this up here? _comment: Water nozzle
Yes, we can attach it up there.
Let me see if I can lock it in there.
That oxygen still hasn't come off the peg.
The what hasn't?
I'll tell you, boy. It poses a serious problem with that O<sub>2</sub> High Rate bit.
Is your window getting foggy, or is it just the angle I'm looking at?
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM.
It looks like it's something on the side. I don't know what it is.
Canaries, Molly. Go ahead.
Roger. We have systems GO on the ground.
Roger. We are GO in here. We are finishing our Alinement Check.
Roger. Understand, and Canaries transmitting a calibrate command.
What was that?
Transmit my T/M cal.
Okay. It's coming.
What was the time we could see that booster?
2 08 52.
Elapsed?
Yes.
Okay. Tell them we're sending them a T/M 2 cal.
A T/M 2 cal is coming.
I don't see where it says for us to do that, but I guess that's all right. I think we should have done it on the first pass.
One of these pills came off. _comment: Germicide pills
Molly Brown, Canary CAP COM.
Go, Canaries.
Roger. After your burn your orbit is 85.6, 92.6.
Roger. 85.6, 92.6.
And I have a Two-Bravo time.
I thought they weren't going to give those times to us.
Stand by.
If either one of these things leaks, we can just close up shop. _comment: Food packages
Okay. What's the Two-Bravo time?
Roger. ΔV90. GMTRC 16 52 25. GETRC 02 28 35. Roll left 55.
Roger. Two-Bravo: 90 ΔV. 16 52 25 GMTRC. Elapsed time of 02 28 25. Roll left 55.
That's affirm.
What is it?
Corn beef sandwich.
Where did that come from?
I brought it with me. Let's see how it tastes. Smells, doesn't it?
Yes, it's breaking up. I'm going to stick it in my pocket.
Is it?
It was a thought, anyways.
Yep.
Not a very good one.
Pretty good, though, if it would just hold together.
Want some chicken leg?
No, you can handle that.
What was the time of that booster again? What elevation?
02 08 52. 18° el.
02 —
2 hours, 8 minutes, 52 seconds. 18° el.
Above? They didn't give us the mileage, huh?
19 miles.
Dead ahead.
Yeah.
We're alined just about perfect. What do you think, looking out your window?
Yeah, man. That's beautiful!
What else have we got to do? Scanners should be on secondary. Now we're going to yaw 180° here.
Hey, look out there. There's some land.
Yes.
What time is it?
4 —
Must still be over Canaries.
You're a noisy eater.
Oh, no!
What? What did you drop?
Look at 'em jumping around down there. _comment: Food bags
What elapsed is it now, Gus?
1:56.
How do you like this going backwards? You can tell you're going backwards too, can't you?
Never a doubt.
That's not bad for applesauce.
I'll take a bite of applesauce, if you don't eat it all.
It's getting tough to squeeze out of there.
If we had some pork chops to go with it, we'd be all right.
Yes.
Here it is back. What are you going to do with it now?
What, the applesauce?
Yes.
I don't know, the tablet fell off. I'm not going to put the germicide tablet in, because I don't know where it is.
Let's see what my retrofire attitude looks like going backwards.
Okay.
16° nose down is what it is.
Yep. I'll be there in a minute.
Oh, man!
I'll tell you, man, you don't need anything to tell your yaw, do you?
No, I'll tell you, I need some of these missions where I can look out of the window. I haven't looked out of this window a second and a half. It's beautiful!
You know, if I lined up the yaw, I'd line it up right there. What does it look like to you?
Look's to me like you got it, Gus.
That's not what the 8-ball shows. It's right there, no doubt about it.
Well, that looks good to me.
Let's try it upside down once.
Okay.
Watch everything float to the ceiling.
There's 60 left, okay?
That's 60 left.
No. Well, yes, let's see.
That's inverted.
Okay.
There's 60 left.
That's what I figured.
There you go.
Isn't that beautiful?
That's 60 left right there. That's hard to fly.
The sun is sure bright.
We can't see the booster. Have to be turned around for this check. We can't see it. We're facing the wrong way.
Let's see. Where's the next station we're coming to?
Kano.
The sun's hot.
It is.
Suit inlet temperature is still holding at 58, though.
Boy, this is a manual dexterity test. _comment: Opening food bag feeding port
Yes.
That stuff is really trying to crawl out of there. _comment: Grapefruit juice
John Yardley loses his bet. Cabin temperature is up to 92°.
Oh, man!
It's bad, isn't it?
That sun is something else.
Yes.
Can you stow these back over there in your side? _comment: Food packages
Yes.
Somehow.
You don't need that towel, do you?
Yes, I'm going to, very shortly.
Well, I'd better get it out then.
Well, I don't think I'll need it, but I might.
Well, we've got a scanner light on secondary.
There, it went out. I guess I was looking at it in the sun.
Yes.
Hope that stops it. now we've got it again.
The sun's around there. That sun's pushing it off.
Yes.
Either that or our ball is out of alinement.
What time's it supposed to be next time. Do you remember?
No.
You don't mind if I make an inflight modification to the pressure suit, do you?
What are you going to do?
Just cut a strap.
I hope you don't cut a hole in it.
No, don't worry.
We've got a scanner ignore light …
Okay, let's start this thing right now.
Okay, it's pitching up slightly. Going up above zero. I don't have a scanner light. man, is it dark!
I don't have a scanner light, but I don't think it's doing right. We're now 20° above the horizon and have no horizon. It's bringing me back down to 180.
It's dark.
Yes.
Hey, look at those thrusters glowing!
Where?
Over on the right side. I think it's the sun shining on them, or something. Is the sun on my side? Sunset?
It's back behind us some place.
You mean the RCS thrusters?
Yes.
I can't see them.
Can you see yours?
No.
Well, I see mine shining.
I can probably see the horizon now, though.
I see those thrusters.
It's the sun shining off of them, because we haven't used the A-Ring yet.
That must be what it is.
A-Ring isn't hot.
Okay, waste valve NORMAL.
What time is it in the flight plan?
It's 2 hours and 9 minutes.
2 hours and 10 minutes.
You're supposed to give an oral temperature.
I'll give them one.
Okay. Translation Check at 2:17, which is 7 minutes away.
Know what kind of transmission check it is?
Translation Check…We're not going to send anything.
We're supposed to get photos, but it's going to be dark.
Photos of what?
Those thrusters.
Translation thrusters.
There is a ground light. We're really moving. What would that be?
…forest fires.
No, it's a pin point. I see it way below the horizon.
What time is it?
To what?
I'm supposed to change this tape around here sometime.
Translation Check.
During the check?
I think that was a star coming over the horizon I saw. I can see it move now.
There goes your …
Okay, waste valve back to NORMAL.
I've got to make a translational thrust in two and a half minutes.
Okay. Well, I'll wait till you finish that then, if that's okay with you.
Yes.
You want to take pictures on this?
We're supposed to with a 16 mil.
Okay. Shoot, we've hardly used any film. Of course there's 130 feet in there. Wait a second till I get the suit closed.
Okay.
Gee.
Your recommendation on that covering underwear is well taken.
Man! I don't believe this 8-ball. It is way off. Look at it. It's way off. There's zero right there. Right?
Yes.
It says minus 10° down on the ball. I guess it's that Orbit Rate, isn't it?
Yes, probably.
What time is it?
It's —
It's 10 ft/sec with the forward firing ones.
Molly Brown, CSQ CAP COM. Do you read?
CSQ CAP COM, Molly Brown.
Roger read you weak but clear. We have you green from the ground.
Roger. Getting ready for a translation burn.
You going to use the aft burn or the forward burn?
I'm going to use them all.
Okay.
Molly Brown, CSQ CAP COM. We're standing by for the maneuvers.
Roger. 5 seconds . . .
Using the aft ones?
No, forward-firing ones.
9 ft/sec-10. Okay, now 1 second on the others.
Molly Brown, CSQ. Would you give us your IVI readouts before and after the burn?
Roger, IVI readouts before the burn were all zeros. After the burn was 10 ft/sec forward.
Roger. Understand. 10 ft/sec forward.
That was in the 009° attitude. 10 ft/sec forward.
Roger.
That was with a 90° yaw.
Molly Brown, CSQ. Be advised I sent T<sub>X</sub> twice. I've had spacecraft reject. I'll try again.
Molly Brown, CSQ.
Go.
We still cannot get an … back from spacecraft on T<sub>X</sub>.
Roger, I'll set the T<sub>X</sub> for the … Over.
Say again.
Molly Brown, CSQ. How did your attitudes hold during the maneuver?
Attitudes held very well.
Roger.
Molly Brown, CSQ.
…
You still look real good from the ground here.
Roger.
Okay. Replaced the tape recorder cartridge.
Molly Brown, CSQ CAP COM.
Go ahead CSQ.
Would you give us a propellant quantity readout before and after the burn?
Before the burn it was 66 percent, and now it reads 61 percent.
Molly Brown, say again.
66 percent before, 61 percent after.
Roger.
I'm not real sure of that before burn.
At 1645 GMT, changed the tape from No. 28 to No. 10. Okay.
That looks like it's in the ball park.
This thing isn't alined, is it?
I think you're right.
Give it one more chance.
Let's see — 2:22 elapsed. Carnarvon comes up in about a minute.
Molly Brown, Molly Brown, Carnarvon CAP COM.  How do you read?
Carnarvon, this is Molly Brown. Read you loud and clear.
Very good, Gus; we'd like to get a blood pressure on the co-pilot, please, and could I have your status?
Okay — blood pressure's coming and our status is green.
Very good.  We don't have any communications with the Cape at this time, but they have requested for me to run down your flight control problem a little bit.  The first thing I'd like to know is what kind of rates are you getting if you just let it yaw?
They are very slow, Pete. Probably on the order of a quarter of a degree per second.
Okay and you are in a horizon scan mode, is that correct?
At the present time I'm in Pulse and alining the platform.
Okay.  You're in pulse alining the platform.  Are your ACME logic yaw rate gryos and attitude drivers and all that stuff still primary?
Affirmative.
Okay, strike all that other stuff. It sounds to me like you've got a mechanical problem in the valve. Is that what you figured?
Roger, it must be very, very slight. We can't see the pressure go down.
Okay, and you have turned off 3, 4, 7 and 8 yaw circuit breakers and put them on again, and that didn't have any effect?
Yes, we've gone through everything, Pete.
Okay, and no cross-coupling.
Negative.
Okay. That should keep them happy back there. We are not going to send you a load. Your T<sub>R</sub> is good. I don't have your clock counting down with mine. I guess you have a different one in. We got your blood pressure and your clocks are on as far as SET goes.
That's — Pete.
Roger.
And I have a question for John. I would like to know how his waste evaluation is doing.
In process. Tell him.
In process.
In process. Roger. Roger.
You have a GO down here from everybody, and do you have suit temps for me, please?
Yes, suit temp is running 58°, Pete. We are okay.
Righto.
2:26. Rate gyros primary. Roll jets yaw.
Molly Brown, Carnarvon.
Go.
Would you turn your real-time telemetry off after LOS from Carnarvon, please?
Roger, real-time off after Carnarvon.
Yes. We didn't get a T<sub>X</sub> up to you.
Roger.
You're going to make these Horizon Scan Checks after a little bit?
Yes. You do it, because I'm busy here.
Molly Brown, this is Carnarvon. How do you read?
Still read you loud and clear.
Okay, you'll probably go over the hill, Gus. You look good here on the ground. We'll see you on your next go.
Roger, thank you, Pete.
Be sure I don't throw any switches over there while I'm moving around.
No, I'll keep a check on you. I don't believe that scanner's doing the right thing by us at all. If it is, the ball isn't.
Want this bag for anything?
Yes, I put the paper towels back in it.
Okay, I can thrust now?
Wait till I get my suit zipped up.
….
Better get that sight out for me.
Huh?
Should get that sight out before long, too.
Okay.
I can't get the auxiliary light off there.
It's really black out there.
Yep.
I've got a scanner ignore light. Shoot, that ball must be way off.
Okay.
Oh, man! It's hot.
What's the matter, Gus?
Oh, there it is. I was losing the horizon. Don't tell me our secondary scanners are out now. That isn't right. Let's see what happens. This ball is way off. Good night! Our ball has drifted way off. Let's just go into daylight and aline the thing.
You've got the answer.
Pulse. Going to use those stars. There's zero roll all right.
Well, that's great! I can't bust up the bag. Sure like to get that smell out of here and the only way I can do it is to bust that bag.
What bag?
It won't break.
What do you mean?
I mean this bacteriacide bag.
Got it — a little.
There we go.
We're coming into daylight again.
Does that look roll-level to you?
Looks what?
Is that level to you? Looking out the window.
Yes.
What about yaw? I can't really tell yaw, can you?
No.
Have you got that —
What?
Let's see. You don't see the moon any place, do you?
No.
It'll be coming up over my — on my right here pretty soon.
Boy, I tell you I really dig this zero g. This is the finest way to go I ever saw.
That looks about right in pitch. Roll is off.
Can you stick this on your side?
That mess? Doesn't that go in your food box?
Would if there was any room in it.
I don't have any room.
I don't either.
Drop it back behind the seat, I guess.
I'll try to stick it in the food box.
Okay, what does the flight plan say about here, Gus?
I'm supposed to be doing the Horizon Scanner Check, but I don't have time to do it.
Oh, okay. Well thanks, I'm done. I'm supposed to be doing that O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check. Is it at 2:40 in the flight plan?
Yes. 2:40 right now.
Okay, we'll got to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. I've —
Man! The primary scanners are working! How about that!
I got to have some light here to look at the oxygen gages. Is that all right?
Yeah, I just can't figure out —
Okay, I'll go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. O<sub>2</sub> High Rate isn't the way to go.
Okay, MARK. O<sub>2</sub> High Rate.
I'm sure uncomfortable.
Yes, it's bad.
Let's leave the heater switch off and let the oxygen pressure come down a bit.
It will come down, and I mean it will come down!
You got the batteries on?
And at the start of the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check, O<sub>2</sub> quantity was reading 65 percent. Cabin pressure was 5.1. Cabin pressure is building slowly.
Look at that suit inlet temperature go up.
Is that moon coming up at about the right spot for you for zero yaw?
I don't see it over here, Gus.
Almost dead ahead. Maybe it's daylight. Maybe it's the sunrise.
Thruster sounds are about like the trainer, aren't they?
Yeah, not bad, is it? See, the O<sub>2</sub> pressure is coming down now. Okay, the mains coming on the line, in case we need the heaters.
Got the scanners again, I guess. That's what I got the last time.
Yeah. Okay, the O<sub>2</sub> pressure is now down to 925 and we have been on O<sub>2</sub> High Rate two minutes. Coming up on two minutes.
What was that?
Cabin pressure relief valve. Cabin pressure relief valve relieves with a loud shhh!
Still don't have that scanner light out. There it goes. That's what caused that thing to go out the last time—when you turned those mains on.
The horizon scanner?
Yes, but it came back on again, though.
That son-of-a-gun is relieving at 5.8, isn't it?
Okay, 2 minutes and 30 seconds O<sub>2</sub> High Rate.
And the Greenwich mean time is 1707.
Hey, give me that sight down there.
Okay.
I'll miss my tracking task.
You know what they did, they turned the sight around.
Really?
Yes.
Okay, that's three minutes and ten seconds of O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. Don't want to stay on it five minutes. I think that is more than a guy can stand. The suit inlet temperature is up to 64 and pressure is down to 825. We will shoot it a shot of manual heaters here when it gets to 800.
Okay, MARK. Four minutes on the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check. Now we will go to the first shot of manual heaters.
Man! It's almost impossible to see out with the sight in front of you.
Pressure is still dropping. Now it's coming up. Okay.
When you get that scanner light it pitches you right down.
Yeah. That's what they said it'd do, didn't they? Okay, 10 seconds to go, and been holding the manual heater switch in for the last minute. It's keeping the pressure up to 825.
Oh, man! That ball is staying way off —
Okay, MARK. O<sub>2</sub> High Rate recocked.
Give me the mark when you think I've got zero yaw.
Okay.
Oh, man! I don't know about this.
Turning the auto heater off.
Can't see a thing, Gus. The quantity at the end of the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate Check was down to 62 percent. Started at 66 and ended 62. I can't see a thing out the window, Gus, because of the sun.
This is about zero yaw.
Go a little bit left.
That looks pretty good, although —
That's about what we had in pitch attitude for zero before, wasn't it?
Yes.
Okay. At 2:40 in the flight plan —
That shows 30° off on the ball.
Started out at 66 and ended at 62, at 2:40. _comment: Oxygen quantity
Hey, what time do we come across the coast here?
We come across the coast at 3:04. What time is it?
That's too much pitch-up for zero attitude, don't you think?
Huh?
Is this too much pitch-up for zero attitude?
Yep.
Okay, the OAMS propellant at 2:50 is 62 percent.
You going to leave those mains on?
No.
It's dropping down pretty good.
No, no it didn't, see?
Coming up?
Yes. Well, I'm going to turn them off now and see what happens. Okay. The mains are off. Been on seven minutes while we were on O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. Okay, we are down to 62 percent at three hours. We are two percent under what we should be. That ought to be good enough for a couple of orbits.
I really can't tell whether I have zero yaw or not. What do you think?
Get off some and then I can tell.
I'll take this sight down out of here a second.
I have to get the 8-ball caged.
Now I can tell you have — haven't.
Do I have to go to the right?
You have to go back to the right. You are going the right way.
Yes.
Now, let's see what T<sub>R</sub> is.
How does that look to you? Is that enough?
It looks pretty good to me, Gus.
Hello, Molly Brown. This is Hawaii CAP COM.
Hello, Hawaii. This is Molly Brown.
Confirm your telemetry in REAL-TIME and ACQUISITION.
Telemetry is in REAL-TIME and ACQ. Neil —
I thought they told us to put it in COMMAND over Carnarvon.
Yeah. Go ahead, Molly Brown.
I have a problem with the 8-ball here, keeping it alined, or Orbit Rate control is not right.
Say again, Molly Brown. I didn't understand.
The attitude on the 8-ball is drifting badly. I'm trying to get it alined right now.
Okay. Understand the 8-ball attitude is drifting badly. You have a GO from the ground. We are ready to up-line a 4-1 T<sub>R</sub> to you.
Roger.
John, do you think I've got too much right yaw?
Ready to copy it?
Tell them to send it.
Go ahead and send it.
Okay, sending now.
Roger, 4-1 time received and verified.
And we would like to send you a T<sub>X</sub> as soon as you are ready.
Roger. Send T<sub>X</sub>.
Right, sending T<sub>X</sub> now. And we confirm your T<sub>R</sub> — in synch.
Give us a hack when you start your Gage Correlation Check.
Okay, Roger. Mark the Gage Correlation Check.
Roger. Got it.
Okay. Gage Correlation Check at 1816, and away we go. _note: Pilot misread 24-hour clock. It should have been 1716.
What do you thin, John? Do you think that's about it? _note: Reference to yaw alinement
Yes.
—and the propellant quantity is 60 percent.
That should be about zero, shouldn't it?
Yes.
Molly Brown, Hawaii CAP COM. Are both your attitude indicators drifting together?
Affirmative.
Okay.
Natch. Cabin temperature — 92. Suit temperature — 58. Cabin pressure is 5.6. Suit CO<sub>2</sub> is 3/4. Left bottle is 5100. Right bottle is 5050. O<sub>2</sub> quantity 62. Pressure is 840. Source temperature is 55. Source pressure is 2000. OAMS fuel —
Molly Brown, Hawaii CAP COM. Everything looks good on the ground. We will see you on the next time around. Aloha.
Roger.
Roger. We are in the middle of the Gage Correlation Report.
OAMS fuel temperature — 68. RCS A temperature — Gee! A temperature is 87.
Look at the ball. It immediately goes out in roll.
It sure does, Gus.
I think the rest of it is all right.
It could be the horizon scanner, huh?
A pressure is 2000 — B is 2650 — Main ammeter No. 1 is 19 — No. 2 is — 1A is —
Now there it is coming in. It is in SEF mode.
Looks good, Gus.
Yes, when I go to small-end-forward it alines it all right.
Maybe we ought to aline it small-end-forward, huh?
Well, that is, if you go to ORBIT RATE it goes off. That's what happens.
That Orbit Rate isn't any good, then.
Yes.
Molly Brown, RKV CAP COM. Over.
RKV, this is Molly Brown.
Roger. We are standing by for your respiratory maneuver.
Roger.
The respiratory maneuver? I can give it to them.
Here it comes.
Roger. We copy, Molly Brown. We are standing by for your pilot's oral temp and blood pressure.
Blood pressure is on the way.
Roger.
RKV, Molly Brown.
Stand by. Roger, we are receiving the blood pressure, Molly Brown.
Molly Brown, RKV. We have received your blood pressure and temperature.
Roger, RKV. The platform alines all right when I'm in SEF and, evidently, when I go to ORBIT RATE it drive the ball off in roll.
Roger. Understand. Stand by one.
The Gage Correlation Report is complete.
The Gage Correlation Report is complete.
Time is 1821. Can I read these into the recorder, Gus, or will it get to you? _comment: Pilot misread 24-hour clock. It should have been 1721
Read it into the recorder.
Okay.
Let's see. It's pitching down on Orbit Rate. Horizon Scan now. Let's see if it stops it. Pitched down to 10°.
Molly Brown, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead.
If you are drifting in Orbit Rate, suggest you select a mode of your own for your tracking task coming up on the coast.
Roger.
Thanks a bunch. Okay, I'll read these quantities off. The GMT was 1716 when we started. Propellant quantity was 60. Cabin temperature — 92. Suit temperature — 58. Cabin pressure — 5.6. Suit CO<sub>2</sub> — 3/4 millimeter. Secondary left O<sub>2</sub> bottle — 5100. Secondary O<sub>2</sub> bottle right was 5050. ECS O<sub>2</sub> quantity — 62 percent. Pressure — 840. Source temperature — 55. Source pressure — 2000. Fuel temp — 68.
You are supposed to take pictures of this.
I know it, I know it — 295. RCS A temperature — 87. RCS A pressure — 3000. RCS B temperature — 82. RCS B pressure — 2650. Main ammeter — 19. No. 2 — 19.5. 1A —4.5. 1B — 4.5. 1C — 4. 2A — 5. 2B — 4 3/4. 2C — 4 3/4. DC volts 23.5. S1 — 29. S2 — 29. C — 27. 1A — 24. 1B — 24. 1C — 24. Greenwich Mean Time is 1721. Completed.
Molly Brown, RKV. You are looking good here on the ground. If you have any further comments we are standing by.
Negative.
Roger. Guaymas will be next.
I don't see a good target anyplace.
Man, just pitch over and I'll take a picture.
Can you pitch it down and toward the States, Gus?
Molly Brown, Guaymas CAP COM.
Guaymas, Molly Brown.
Your Three-Alpha times are nominal.
Roger … and nominal.
Can you come across a ground tracking looking down like that, Gus? _comment: Pilot demonstrating with hands on Orbital Path Display
Sideways?
Yes, sideways, and pitch down 90. Will this hurt alinement? — because I can see some targets up north.
You mean roll to the right?
We are standing by for your coolant pump checks.
No. Roll left.
Roll left, and pitch down.
I don't see a good target anyplace.
What did you say, Guaymas?
We are standing by for your report on your Coolant Pump Checks.
Roger.
I don't see anything that makes a decent target at all.
Well, I can't — can you pitch down so I can see something?
Oh, you can't see anything. If I pitched straight over you could have. See?
Yes.
Here, there is a target down there.
Where?
You've got to pitch the nose down. Right by the nose.
That green spot? _comment: The Imperial Valley
No, down — like straight down.
I don't know what you see.
There's all kinds of stuff. See that town down there?
Where?
Right around here on the right.
I can't see over there, John. I'll roll back to the right so we can both see. Ah yeah, there is one right down below here. Let's see if I can get it.
Guaymas, go ahead.
Have you completed your Coolant Pump Checks?
Yes.
Right there?
Yes.
Yes, go ahead.
I'm tracking him right on around.
Okay.
You can't see the pipper.
I know.
Tell them we have done our Coolant Pump Check.
Coolant Pump Checks complete.
Roger. What is the status on the checks?
What difference does it make?
We couldn't get the B pumps to come on simultaneously.
We couldn't get the pumps on simultaneously.
Say again, Molly Brown. You're broken.
We couldn't get the pumps on simultaneously.
I copied you cannot get the pumps on simultaneously.
Roger.
Got the pictures?
Yes.
That is right up from the tip of the Gulf of California, isn't it?
Yes.
I don't see the Salton Sea.
Guaymas standing by for your standby T/M real-time modulation check.
I can't see in here now. I'm blind.
I am too.
Secondary pump is off and T/M to COMMAND.
Molly Brown, Guaymas CAP COM.
Go ahead, Guaymas.
We are standing by for your standby telemetry transmitter check with real-time.
Okay. Tell them to stand by. T/M's in REAL-TIME.
Standby T/M is in REAL-TIME.
Roger.
Hey, Gus. We are coming up on El Paso.
Are we?
Molly Brown, that T/M check is okay on the ground.
Yes.
You see it?
You've got to pitch over. It's beneath us.
Where?
Where?
That's the mountain range right there. See that hill right over there? I think El Paso is under the clouds.
Molly Brown, Guaymas. Would you say again the trouble you are having with your pump check?
We had no trouble with the pump check.
Roger.
Would you remove pump A off of primary?
Is pump A off primary?
We got A off.
Pump A is off primary.
Well, No. 2 audio to RECORD. Suit Fan No. 2 - - check.
At 3:10. Okay.
Change the tape again over the Cape.
Molly Brown. This is Guaymas handing you over to Texas.
Roger.
There is nothing down there to see. You know it?
That sight blocks the window. Know it?
Yeah, I know it.
I couldn't track it in Pulse.
I know.
How much fuel will we need for the next burn?
The standard burn is 93 ft/sec. We will have enough.
We're alined okay, now.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Go ahead, Cape CAP COM.
Do you have your standby telemetry transmitter on and ready for a tape dump?
Okay. Our standby T/M is in REAL-TIME.
Okay. You are commanding it on. All righty, we'll give you the word on it then. What is the status of your other platform modes, Molly Brown — BEF or Free?
Say again.
What is the status of your other platform modes, such as BEF and Free?
Well SEF is fine. Orbit Rate is the one that drives me off in roll. I haven't checked BEF yet. I'll go ahead and give it a check now.
Okay.
How long does it take you to build up this quarter degree rate in that yaw rate, starting from zero yaw rate?
Gordo, it just gradually accelerates. It's some slow leak out there.
Roger. Are you satisfied with obtaining and holding your attitudes visually?
Roger, and the platform is alining properly in SEF.
Okay, fine. You want to turn your standby transmitter off?
Roger, standby transmitter off.
Standby transmitter off.
Okay.
Have you tried secondary scanner?
Roger. We were on secondary scanner for quite awhile. We are back on primary now.
Okay, if you think the platform is drifting too much there for that Control Mode Characteristic Check, just delete that — that at 3 + 30.
Roger. I deleted that one Horizon Scanner Mode Check, too.
Okay. The one earlier?
Roger.
Okay. I have your 4-1 weather for you.
Roger.
It is broken cloud conditions. 20 miles visibility. Wind is 20 knots, at 5 foot seas.
Roger, 20 and 5 foot.
Roger. Did you have any success on contact with the booster?
We were facing the wrong way at that time, making a Horizon Scanner Check.
Yeah, I was afraid you would be. That was a little bit tight in there.
Yes.
Did you manage to see anything over the U.S. because of the clouds?
We could see the southern part of California and Arizona, I guess. That was about it.
You want to get your real-time telemetry and acq aid on?
I can't see it, Gus. I'm blind from looking outside.
It's on.
Okay. We've got it.
How's the weather, in general, around the world?
Very cloudy.
I see.
We've seen very little land.
All clouds and water, huh?
Yep, not even much water.
Roger. We got a DCS update just then. Was that the T<sub>X</sub>. Over?
We just got DCS update, Gordo. Was that the T<sub>X</sub>?
Roger. They got it up and verified.
T<sub>R</sub> looks good, Molly Brown.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Go ahead.
We understand you don't have this rolling off in Free mode. Is that affirmative?
I don't have any in SEF or BEF mode, Gordo. I haven't checked Free yet. Give me another few minutes.
Okay, fine.
But the platform does aline properly in the BEF mode. I can tell that already.
Okay, real good.
We have good verification on your load now, Molly Brown. It looks good.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Go ahead Cape.
Have you had a chance to check that Free mode yet?
I'm in Free mode now, and it looks like it is working all right.
Very good. We were sure interested in that.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Go ahead.
I would like for you to turn that cabin fan on for two minutes and then back off when you can to see as a little experiment.
Okay, it's on.
Okay.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Go ahead.
That next normal burn will be a ΔV of 96.
Roger, the next burn will be 96.
The time on that is 1 + 49.
Roger. 96 ft/sec and 1 + 49 seconds.
1 + 49 and 96 ft/sec.
…
Okay.
Cabin fan is off.
Okay.
Molly Brown, CSQ CAP COM.
CSQ, this is Molly Brown. Go ahead.
Roger. What's the status?
We are GO.
Roger. You look good from the ground. Stand by to copy Three-Bravo times.
Roger.
Molly Brown, CSQ. Let me know when you are ready.
Roger. We are ready.
GMTRC 18 37 58. Ground elapsed time 04 13 58. Bank angle - roll left 55. ΔV 93. Molly Brown, CSQ. Did you copy?
Roger. GMTRC is 18 37 58.
Roger.
Bank angle - 55 left. ΔV 93.
Roger.
Molly Brown, CSQ CAP COM. Cape recommends you perform your OAMS retroburn in BEF after alinement, and stay in BEF up to retrofire.
Roger. Agree with that.
Molly Brown, CSQ. Did you finish your retrofire checklist?
Roger.
Molly Brown, CSQ. Stand by for a GMT time hack.
Roger.
On my mark, GMT will be 18 14 40.
MARK!
Give me one on the even minute.
Roger.
MARK!
Roger.
We are standing by for your Sea Urchin Egg Experiment.
Roger. It's being activated.
Roger. Would you give me a GMT when you turn the handle?
Roger. GMT 15:20.
Roger.
Molly Brown, Molly Brown, Carnarvon. CAP COM. Over.
Carnarvon, Molly Brown.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. We are going to send you a new 4-1 command load and T<sub>R</sub>. Do you have your timer set at 34:00?
Timer set at 34:00.
Okay. In the meantime I'd like to get helium source temperature, pressure, and quantity reading from you.
OAMS propellant quantity is 55 percent.
Roger. 55 percent. Could I have the temperature and pressure? We are going to send you a command load at this time.
Roger. Source pressure is 1950. Source temperature is 81°.
Roger. Thank you. Command load coming.
And the pre-retro checklist is complete, Pete.
Roger. Understand, pre-retro checklist is complete. You've got a new T<sub>R</sub>. You've got a command load. Your clocks are synched down here on the ground and I have about 2 minutes and 15 seconds to go to your 34-minute time hack.
If you are looking at the ground, Molly Brown, Carnarvon has a big fire going for you down here.
We are blunt-end-forward. We can't see them yet.
Okay.
Molly Brown, Carnarvon CAP COM. We have a GO here on the ground, and I have about 1 minute, 30 seconds till your time hack.
Roger.
Molly Brown, Carnarvon. When you have a chance from the pilot, the medics would like to get a reading on the food evaluation.
No time, we'll see them when we get back.
Okay.
Everything is in order.
Roger, roger.
Molly Brown, Carnarvon CAP COM. Stand by for T<sub>R</sub> MARK of 34:00, in approximately 30 seconds.
Roger.
5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 -
MARK. T<sub>R</sub> 34:00.
Roger. The clock is counting down.
Molly Brown, Carnarvon. The medics would like to get the respiratory maneuver when you have a chance.
Roger. It's coming.
Molly Brown, Carnarvon has it loud and clear.
…
This is Carnarvon, Molly Brown. Say again.
What's this new GMT of retrofire you gave us?
Say again.
What is the GMT of retrofire you just gave us?
Roger. The GMTRC is 18 57 23 for a GETRC of 04 33 23.
Molly Brown, Carnarvon. Do you want the rest of the quantities? The Cape said it wasn't necessary unless you want them.
That's okay, Pete.
Molly Brown, this is Carnarvon.
Go ahead.
Cape recommends that I give you your backup quantities there for GMTRC of 18 57 23. It'll be a roll left 55. GMTRB of 19 08 23.  Roll right 65 at GMT 400K 19 01 29.
We got it, Pete.
Okay, Gus. I only have one question for you before you go out of range. How's the flying up there?
Great!
Fine GT-3. See you next trip - next year.
Okay.
Okay. That was the last tape change.
Going to primary scanners at 25 minutes to retrofire.
Okay.
Or GMT of 1832.
Okay.
Can't you get the camera stowed?
There it goes.
Seems like one of those scanners just needs a rest every now and then. You know?
Yes.
Scanner went out at 1833.
There's that scanner light again.
It's out.
It's on again.
It's out again.
Scanner light's out again.
It's on again.
Scanner light is on.
Going to secondary at 1835.
Secondary scanner ignore light is good at 18 35 10.
Now I see what you mean about those RCS thrusters shining when the sun is shining on the nose.
Got your seat belt hooked?
Can you take it around a couple more times?
I don't know. Got your shoulder harness?
Yes, finally.
Now, let me go through this checklist in an orderly manner.
Okay.
T<sub>R</sub>-5 circuit breaker is closed.
Yes.
Okay. All equipment is stowed. Secondary B pump is on.
There comes the sun.
And that old suit temp down there at 55°, S-band-CONTINUOUS, C-band-CONTINUOUS, T/M in REAL-TIME and ACQ.
Main batteries - we tested them. They checked good. C is way up there at 29, S2 —
Man! With that sun shining on the nose, I can't see anything now.
Every time you fire those RCS thrusters S1 and S2 drop voltage. Well, that's not unusual.
Hey, I can see the shadow of the scanner working now.
23.5 on the main bus.
Okay, right circuit breakers all closed.
Man! I hope the 8-ball is right, because there's no horizon.
Okay. Now 4:06 after retrofire is 400K, and 11 minutes after retrofire is reverse.
What's that again, now, John?
4:06 after retrofire is -
Let me write that down.
I'll tell you. I won't forget it.
4:06
And what is reverse?
Eleven minutes flat. That sounds about right, because it was 10 minutes and 51 seconds from our nominal data.
There is still no horizon.
Okay. Give me a mark, and let me check T<sub>R</sub> one more time.
Okay, I'll give it to you at 19:08.
Okay.
Got about 10 seconds. Could give it to you anytime, couldn't I?
Yep.
I'll give it to you at 05.
Okay.
One, MARK.
You're going to be a little late. I think you punched a little late.
19:04. That's a good T<sub>R</sub> check.
Hope the sun doesn't get that scanner right here.
The last burn we received was 96 feet a second and a minute and 49 seconds of burn. Right?
Yeah, we're going to aline.
Okay. Ready for this burn.
Okay. Six minutes.
I've got to start that computer.
Man! There's the horizon and it is beautiful.
Okay. Better pitch over and check yaw.
Huh?
Better check yaw, for sure.
Okay. We have it. It's lying good now and the scanner —
Feels like it. Looks like it.
Got everything but start computer.
Okay, well —
I'm not going to start until later.
Wait a second.
Is it in?
No.
Well, get it in!
96.
96?
I'm in Catch-Up mode.
Okay.
Says to put in 2590960.
Okay.
You have about 2 minutes.
Hawaii CAP COM, Molly Brown.
2 - 5 - 9 - 0 - 9 - 6 - 0
Okay, but — that's what we're going to shoot for.
Okay. At the start of this we'll be about 52 percent. _comment: OAMS propellant quantity
Hawaii, Molly Brown.
Man! I mean we start to burn just as we come over there.
Let's go ahead and hit the Catch-Up thing and see what it says.
Nothing.
Well, let's do it — put it back in. Okay. Now try it.
Okay. Now.
There she goes. 6 - 5 - 4 — how did it get in there?  My attitudes are not 0, 0, 180.
That's how.
96.
Okay.
…
Yes, sir!
The IVI's keep counting up, though.
Yes.
It does keep changing, doesn't it?
Hello, Molly Brown. Hawaii CAP COM.
Hawaii, Molly Brown is all ready for burn.
Roger. Give us a hack on your event timer.
Okay, it'll be 12:55 on my mark.
MARK.
Right, we are right on.
Okay. On my IVI's, I have 97 ft/sec forward and the others are zips.
Roger, and give us a mark for the start of burn.
Roger. We've got about 25 seconds to go.
Roger.
That's perfect out-the-window alinement.
Yes.
10 seconds.
We have 50 percent propellant quantity indicated. Getting ready to fire —
MARK!
We got your start of burn.
Yes, it's burning.
There's 90 —
There's 80 —
70 —
You know, you can't hear those big thrusters.
No.
60 —

There's 28 —
20 —
10 —
4 - 3 - 2 - 1 -
MARK! End of burn.
Right. Mark end of burn. Good show.
We timed that a minute and 48 seconds.
Give us your IVI readings.
IVI's: Fore-Aft 0, Left was 1, Up was 2.
That was the end of burn.
Yes.
Okay, and how did your attitudes look?
Attitudes were right on, plus or minus 2 or 3°.
Okay, they look good on the ground.
Roger.
Now we can go to REENTRY. Right?
Yes.
Okay, I've got 9:29 on the T<sub>R</sub>.
Okay, MARK!
Oh! Give me another.
I'll give you one at 19. Okay?
Okay.
MARK!
Okay, and the propellant source pressure is 1500.
We had indicated 22 percent when we got done, Neil. _comment: OAMS propellant quantity
20 percent. Rog?
About 22.
Okay.
Source pressure is 1500, source temperature 60-50, I mean. And the RCS-both rings on. Antenna okay. On REENTRY. Heaters off. Quantity Read Switch off.
Let's see, did we get all of this?
OAMS power to ATTITUDE, controller stow, attitude PULSE, computer to REENTRY.
Okay.
Now we're lined up good.
Okay, and the retro load is initialized now, because I called addresses 10 and 11 out of the computer.
Now, don't go out of Reentry mode.
Okay, but I don't think it would make any difference, as long as we go back. Okay — platform — rate — computer to REENTRY — RATE COMMAND — roll gyro off.
Yes.
Platform is ORBITAL RATE — No.
No.
Retro power - ARM.
Not now. At T<sub>R</sub>-5, you mean?
Well, this is the 5-minute checklist.
Okay, well, we'll just — 7:20 now.
I haven't heard any of those squib isolation pyros fire yet. Have you?
Yes, I heard the ones on the pad fire.
Did you? I don't remember, I guess.
I was listening for all that jazz.
Oh, were you?
Oh, yeah!
You have to listen for it to hear it.
Can't see inside.
It's bright, isn't it?
Well, the nose looks way down there, but that's about right.
One minute.
Those thunderstorms would make it really tough coming in. You know?
It doesn't look like we're so high.
Batteries on. Mains on —
Got everything on we need. Right?
Yes sir.
Retro power is coming on here at 5:15.
Turn it off now.
Okay. It's 5 minutes.
MARK.
Okay.
That's everything but O<sub>2</sub> High Rate.
Okay.
Molly Brown, RKV CAP COM.
RKV, Molly Brown.
Molly Brown, Molly Brown, RKV CAP COM. Over.
Say again.
Molly Brown, RKV CAP COM. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear, RKV.
Roger. Have you completed T<sub>R</sub>-5 checklist?
Roger.
Roger. I'll give you a mark at T<sub>R</sub>-4.
Did you set your clock over there?
Yes, I want to start it at retrofire.
Okay, both rings working.
Stand by.
MARK!
Roger.
Your clock looks like it's counting good.
Are we all set for T<sub>R</sub>-1?
Yes, just about. We'll make it.
Got it complete?
Yep. The adapter batteries are off. We're complete.
T<sub>R</sub>-5 is complete.
Roger.
Molly Brown, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead.
You want to mark at T<sub>R</sub>-1?
Not necessary.
Roger.
Two minutes.
Molly Brown, RKV. You look good from the ground.
Roger. Thank you.
Roger.
Sure miss that roll rate gyro.
Yes.
That old ticker is really ticking away now, I'll tell you.
Yes. Hope so.
Okay. Give me a mark at one, huh?
Okay.
Got those off? Yes.
Five seconds to one minute.
Okay.
2 - 1 -
MARK!
Separate OAMS?
Yes, go ahead.
Separate electronics, separate adapter.
Molly Brown, RKV.
Hey, the adapter has separated.
Roger, we confirm on the ground. Adapter sep.
Yes, you can really feel it.
Say again.
I said you can really feel it kick off.

Molly Brown, do you confirm all rockets firing normally?
All rockets fired normally and attitudes were right in the center.
Roger. Pass your IVI readouts on to Guaymas. RKV out.
Roger.
Molly Brown, Guaymas CAP COM. Do you copy?
Roger, Guaymas. The IVI's readings were 331 Aft, 105 Right, and 4 Up. Right in the center. An automatic superfine retrofire down the line.
Roger. I copy. 331 Aft, Right 105, Down 04.
Roger, and retropack has jettisoned.
Roger.
Molly Brown, Guaymas CAP COM.
Go.
I'm prepared to give you a T<sub>R</sub> + 3 minute time hack if you need it?
That would be good.
Okay, and I have some event times for reentry: 400K feet 19 10 29 — stand by, Molly Brown.
Molly ?Brown, correct that 400K feet. That's 19 01 29.
Roger.
Molly Brown, I'll give you a time hack in approximately 30 seconds.
Molly Brown, Guaymas. Stand by for a T<sub>R</sub> + 3 minute time hack.

Molly Brown here, go ahead.
Roger. I'm getting your bank angle times momentarily. Your start of Communications Experiment is 19 05 14.
Roger. I have steering on the computer.
I didn't read you on that.
I'm getting initial bank angle commands from the computer.
Okay.
Molly Brown, I have your backup times on the bank angles and time to reverse bank angle.
Go ahead.
Bank left 45°. Bank right 55°. Time to reverse bank angle 19 08 17.
Give me an elapsed time after retro.
Stand by one.
I'm rolling to 60° left now.

Hello there!
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Roger. We're down to 80 000 feet. My needles show us about 25 miles short.
Roger, indicating about 25 miles short on your computer. Very good.
I have a drogue time 19 10 42. What is your altimeter reading?
Reading 60 000.
You say 70 000?
There goes the drogue.
Roger.
Okay, we have a drogue.
Roger, drogue.
Looks pretty good, doesn't it?
Our propellant valves are shut off. We've got a 40K light. Really oscillating.
Roger.
Passing through 30 000 feet.
Roger.
Approximately one minute to the main.
Intrepid, this is Molly Brown.
Roger. Go ahead.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM. How is your main?
We don't have a main yet. Passing through 13 000.
Roger.
Molly Brown, how is your main. Over?
Okay. We have a good stable chute. Going to landing attitude.
Oh, man! That was the roughest one of the whole bunch, wasn't it!?
Oh man!
Okay. We all set?
Yes. Now we go through the post-main checklist.
Let's see, can they read us now?
Yes.
Cape CAP COM, this is Molly Brown.
Molly Brown, Cape CAP COM.
Intrepid, this is Molly Brown.
Roger. We are reading you now and then. How us?
Loud and clear. I have 30 ft/sec rate of descent. Passing through 5500.
You never took your D-Ring out, huh?
Roger, 5500.
Yes I did, too!
Oh, did you?
You better believe it!
Face plate open?
Open?
That's what the checklist says. Indicate Landing Control circuit breaker open.
What?
Indicate Landing Attitude Control circuit breaker open. That's that second one over on your panel. There you go.
ACME bias power off.
Molly Brown, this is Intrepid. It appears you will land 5 miles ahead of me. Over.
Roger. Thank you.
That'll be nice. Rescue beacon is on.
Do you have us in sight, Intrepid?
Not yet. Over.
Roger.
I'll turn the rescue beacon on, then.
Rescue beacon coming on.
Passing through 4000.
Suit fan to No. 2.
That drogue chute is right above us, or the pilot chute.
I understand the drogue is just above you, or the pilot chute.
Say again.
RCS heater's off. We did not do that heater check. Oh, well. We didn't need it anyways. RCS temperature was way up. Scanner Heater circuit breaker open.
Do you smell that fuel? Fumes from that stuff?
Yes. Let's close up.
Yes. I can see 'em smoking out there.
Suit flow increase.
They'll get quenched in a minute.
Reentry Antenna Experiment off.
Okay. Manual O<sub>2</sub> High Rate - PULL. I don't think we want to do that yet, do you?
No.
I imagine it is pretty bad in here.
The water seal is closed. AC power off.
Okay.
We're coming through the lower layer, John. You better get ready to hit. We're at 2000. No telling how far the altimeter is off.
Okay.
I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
You can put your head back.
Landing attitude was a bump, wasn't it?
Yes.
We're at 1500 feet.
We're in good shape.
We may have to go on O<sub>2</sub> High Rate with that smell in here.
I know it.
It's probably just from that hot metal.
I think that's what it is.
I'm sure it is. There's nothing coming out of the thrusters.
No.
600 feet.
Landing attitude cover open. I thought it was parajett.
Oh, No!!
300 feet. It ought to be pretty soon now.
Broken my face plate when we went to landing attitude.
Did it?
That's what the problem was, right there. _note: Reference to sight mounting bracket extension
Look at the smoke coming out the thrusters.
They're off.
I don't understand that.
We better go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate and close the snorkle.
Okay.
Post-landing checklist. Parachute jett-pushed. Landing safe. Safe the landing bus. Helmet off and stowed. I'd leave it on. Arm restraints -
This is Molly Brown in the water. Anybody read?
Molly Brown, this is Big Box 15. You are loud and clear. Check with Big Box 14.
Roger. We're floating well in the water.
Okay. Shoulder fitting stowed. Got the cabin light off. Helmet - off and stow. Arm restraints stow.
Hey, start over again.
Post-landing checklist. Helmet - off and stow. I don't think we ought to do that.
No, not yet.

Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Hello there, Houston. Gemini 4 here, how do you read?
I read you a little bit garbled. Give me your IVI readings.
Roger. I have 20 forward, 11 right, 2 down.
Roger. 20 forward, 11 right, and 2 down.
Gemini 4, are you on UHF-2 now?
...turning around. Affirmative on UHF-2 now and ...
Roger.
Okay. I got the old second stage. It's spinning away and looks pretty.
Roger. You say, it's spinning away?
Roger. It's starting to tumble a little.
Roger.
Roger. Gemini 4, I have a new 1 alpha time for you.
Okay.
It's 14 05.
Understand, 1 alpha 14:03.

Roger.
Hey, Jim. How fast is that booster tumbling?
I can't give you that. ... going around.
Is it just slowly rotating?
Roger, it's slowly rotating.
Roger, okay.
It doesn't look big.
We'll lose you in about 30 seconds, Jim.
Okay.
How do you like that?
Before I leave you, let me tell you the lights are working.

Roger. How far are you from the launch vehicle?
Roger. Right now we're alining the platform and it's going below our lower left, and we'll be going down after it in a moment. We're after it right now.
We presently don't have it in sight; we aline the platform.
I have it sighted this time. It's directly below me about 400 or 500 feet. I'm going to thrust down ...
Roger. We have it below us right now, exactly below us at about 400 to 500 feet. The light is coming through quite clearly.
Roger.
We're passing over a big desert now.
Canary, Gemini 4. Be advised there isn't enough time to get a good platform aline there. I don't want this thing to get too far from me.

Hello, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
Roger. Give me your status.
Roger, we're GO. Everything looks great.
Roger, Gemini 4. You look good here on the ground. Can you give me your battery readouts, please?
Roger, stand by. Here they come.
Gemini 4, you can turn your radiator, --correction, your secondary pump off. Your evaporators are normal. Your radiator looks good.
Roger. Evaporators NORMAL, and secondary pump A OFF. Understand radiator looks good.
Okay. Give me about 10 seconds on your Quantity Read Switch.
Roger. Coming on.
Roger.
I'm standing by for your battery readouts.
While you're doing that, can the Command Pilot give me a little information on the booster, the distance, what you have to do to get that close to see it, and how's the light working?
Roger. The light's working fine. I can't tell exactly how far it is though, I guess I'm probably a half a mile or so. The booster started tumbling right after we came off of it. I tried to dump the rates down, and I got them down till it looked like one-quarter degree per second but as soon as we got off I got around to see it, it was tumbling.
Okay. How much ΔV did you use before you got there?
I got about 30 ft/sec showing on my window there.
Okay.
The booster fell away quite rapidly and got below us like there was a considerable difference in our velocity, and I let the thing get too far from me.
All right. Can you give me the battery readout? If they look good I can give you a GO for 3-4. ... and we're standing by for a blood pressure from the Pilot.
Carnarvon, this is Gemini 4. I see lights of a town below me.
Okay. 3, 2, 1-
MARK!
Did you get that time hack?
Roger, got that time hack, and am standing by for the ΔV up.
Go ahead.
Roger. 1. 1-A and 2-B are 24, and they all look good.
Roger.
... 1-A is 6. 1-B is 10. 1-C is 11. 2-A is 6. 6-B is 5, and 2-6 is 6.
Okay. Showing 24 on 2-A, B and C also?
Roger. I'm getting 24 on all my adapter batteries.
Okay. Your readings are good.
... All checks out good.
Okay. Giving you a GO for 3-4, changing your TR time.
And I'm giving you a new load.
We got the update coming in.
Okay, I've got the load ready, you got the new TR time. We're standing by for that Pilot's blood pressure. You ready to copy your update time?
Roger, I copy the update time, ... the blood pressure.
Okay. 2-1. 170. 3+40. 01 32 39. 2+18. 8+32. Over.
Roger. We're coming up on the booster now, and you can see the daylight starting to break. The lights are quite visible, and I estimate that we're probably in the vicinity of three-quarters of a mile from the booster at the time now. The lights are very easy to see, and the horizon is quite easily defined at this time. We've unstowed the Contarex, the Hasselblad, the 16-mm and the blood pressure cuff. We're both finding that there is not as much velcro as we'd like to have in the spacecraft. We feel like we need more storage of loose items. Same thing that John and Gus found.
Roger. Say again the first four quantities, please.
I say, what you want repeated?
Roger, the first four quantities.
2-1 170. 3+40. 01 32 39. Over.
Roger. Would you say them with a little more pause between them, please.
Does he want to try them again?
Would you say them with more pause between the, ... I ...
2-1 170. 3+40. 01 32 39. 2+18. 8+32. Over.
This is Jim here. And I'm having a lot of difficulty telling how far out I am from the booster. I can see the two lights flash occasionally, and that's the only thing that tells me where I am at all - as far as distance with respect to the booster. I didn't get the time to aline my platform well before I went into ...
Roger. Understand, I read you. 1 170. 3+40. 01 32 34, 2+18. 8+30.
On your GETRC that's 01 32 39. Over. 9.
Hello, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
01 32 39.
Roger. We're GO. Everything looks great.
Roger, that's affirmative. Your orbit is about 86.8 by 150.6.
Roger. Stand by. They're coming.
Roger. 86.8 by 150.6. Sounds good.
Roger. We need that blood pressure on the Pilot.
Roger, that will be coming up next.
I'm going to ... a little bit more ...
And I'll need your accelerometer bias.
You'll have to stand by for the accelerometer bias.
Hand me the ... book, will you, Jim?
The data book.
Yes. I just can't keep the booster in sight and ...
Okay. You can give it to Guaymas.
I'm afraid you'll have to wait for another orbit or two.
All righty.
Your light is on in case you're going to read it.
Huh?
Your lights are on.
Yes.
Roger. Evaporator NORMAL and Secondary Pump A OFF. Understand everything looks good.
Roger. Coming ON.
...
Blood pressure is coming in.
Roger.
Roger.
Why don't you do that, Jim?
Roger. The light's working fine. I can't tell exactly how far up I am from it. I guess I am probably around a half a mile or so. The booster started tumbling as we came off of it. I started to damp the rates down, and I got them down to what looked like a quarter degree per second, but as soon as we came off and I got around to see it, it was tumbling.
...
I've got about 30 ft/sec showing on my windows here. The booster fell away quite rapidly and got below us like there was a considerable difference in our velocities, and I've been struggling here to not let the thing get too far from me.
...
Roger. Your adapter battery readouts are coming at you. They all are reading 24, 1-A through 1-C on voltage. The amperes are 6 on 1-A, 10 on 1-B, 11 on 1-C, 6 on 2-A, 5 on 2-B, 6 on 2-C. The RCS rings look good.
...
Roger.
Carnarvon, this is Gemini 4. I'm seeing the lights of the town below me.
...
MARK!
Roger. Got your time hack.
We had a ring in one of our books come loose. It looks like that would be pretty bad if they all got loose - if they all came out of the card.
My fingertip lights are right on my first knuckle and it is making a sore spot on my center right finger.

This is Gemini 4, Houston. ...
Standing by.
It has a pretty good tumble rate. I'll try to time it here.
Makes about one complete revolution in about 8 seconds. It's tumbling end over end. It looks like now we're out a little further than we were before. We've slipped out a little bit. I'd estimate it's out about a mile and a half or maybe a little more. It was really quite a view when we first saw it down there. It looked like almost one of the artist's conceptions. It was so vividly clear.
Right now, we're in nose-to-the-ground type attitude, such that I don't believe the ground stations are able to read us. We have heard several calls cut in and out for us. We're going to stay in this attitude though for a while to keep the booster in sight. It doesn't appear that we're making too much progress in closing with the booster right now. It looks like it's staying out about the same distance as it was before. During the night sight when the booster was below us, it appeared that there was almost a sky full of stars. There was so much of the venting coming off the booster and into the sky. In fact, I commented on it that they looked like they were stars. When you look closely at the booster at that time, you could see the fuel -- actually the white vapors coming out of the aft end of the booster, and I guess that was spreading the little fireflies all around. It was to such an extent though, it covered the whole visible area in front of us.
Hello, Guaymas. This is Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Roger, Guaymas. We still have the booster. We're out quite a ways from it now, and it's taking a little more fuel than we had anticipated. We've got 61 in the fore and aft window in the aft direction, 37 left and 36 up at the present time. We appear right now to be just about holding our own with it. Of course, we should as we progress here. We should start to close with it, but it's out further than we had hoped to let it get right now.
Roger, I copy.
Is there any way of giving me a quick check on what my orbit is? This thing is way below me.
Say again.
I said the booster is way below me. Could you tell me my present orbit? As soon as possible.
Roger, we're working on it.
Gemini 4, we'll update you with the orbit calculations some time after the pass over the States.
Roger, I understand. And be advised our cabin pressure seems to be holding just a hair below 5. It stabilized down initially at 5.5, decreased to 5.25, and then went back up to 5.5, and it's now down a little below 5.
Roger. We copy.
All right, you might get a confirmation for me on that on the ground.
Roger. We're working on it. Put your Quantity Read Switch to READ.
Roger. It's going to READ.
Guaymas, this is Gemini 4. We're going to have to get a resolution right away whether you want me to really make a major effort to close this last thing or to save fuel.
Guaymas, do you read Gemini 4?
Roger, we copy. We suggest you stand by. We want to save the fuel.
Okay. I guess it probably expended about 100 ft/sec.
You expended 100 ft/sec?
Yes, that's just a rough guess.
Roger. We're finished with the Quantity Read, Gemini 4.
Roger.
Place the Quantity Read Switch to --
It's off.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM. Flight advises they like to save the fuel. You'll be advised over the Cape.
Well, I just can't wait till I get to the Cape. I guess we're just going to have to watch it go away. I've retrograded enough to help bring me down but I don't want to get down to wherever it's going.
Roger.
Okay. I guess we'll scrub it.
Okay. Can you give me a tag on my orbit as quick as you can?
We're working on it.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Jim, we've estimated you've used about 50 percent of your OAMS capability at this time.
Roger. I think we ought to knock it off, Gus. It keeps falling, it's probably three or four miles away, and we just can't close on it.
Right, knock off. No more rendezvous with the booster.
Okay. Roger.
Okay. We're giving you a GO for your EVA at this time.
Okay. I would like to know what kind of an orbit I'm in now.
We're working on it, but you may not get it until we get to Canary.
Okay.
Okay. I want to give you your 3-1, 3-4, 4-4 times so tell me when you're ready to copy.
Stand by 1.
Roger.
Okay. Be advised I'm going to let the booster go and not track it anymore. I'm going to aline the platform and start conserving fuel.
Go ahead. This is Gemini 4.
Gemini 4 is ready to copy.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Go ahead Houston. Gemini 4 is ready to copy.
Roger. 3-1 171. 3+42. 18 19 03. 2+23. 8+42. Do you want to read those back to me?
Roger. 3-1 171. 3+42. 18 19 03. 2+23. 8+42.
Roger. 3-4. Tell me when you're ready.
Ready to go. Just keep shooting.
120. 2+36. 19+34. 3+41. 9+47.
Roger. 3-4 is 120. 2+36. 19 34 39. 3+41. 8+47.
Roger. 4-4 134. 2+55. 21 08 03. 2+47. 8+30.
Roger. 4-4 is 134. 2+55. 21 08 09. 2+46. 8+30.
Negative on the GMTRC. That is 21 08 03.
Roger. 21 08 03.
Roger. All the rest is correct.
I have your onboard map update.
Roger.
Ascending node 157 West. G.m.t. of ascending node is 16:34.
Roger, I understand. Ascending node 157 West; G.m.t. 16:34.
Roger. Could you give me some idea of what your attitudes were over Carnarvon and Canton?
Roger. We were nose-down tracking the booster and I'm afraid that our attitudes were not so that we could read with good reception on those stations.
Roger.
They read us to some extent. Did they get the blood pressure?
They didn't get a very good one, but you're going to give another one around here some place, aren't you?
Roger. Be advised the gun is out and stowed and assembled and we've got out cameras and we'll be going after the equipment.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Would you go to PRELAUNCH on your computer. You might give me your IVI readouts before you do.
Roger. They were 20 aft and 76 up.
Roger. Are you in PRELAUNCH now?
Roger. In PRELAUNCH now.
I'm alining the platform.
Roger.
Gemini, we estimate you still have about 200 feet ΔV left.
Roger. That's what I've got.
Roger.
CAP COM. Can you give us a G.m.t. time hack? I missed it before.
Roger. I'll give you a G.m.t. at 16 56 00.
Roger.
CAP COM. I'd like a hack at 16 56.
Roger. It will be 3 more seconds.
MARK!
That was 16 56 04.
Roger.
We have a new hack on your orbit. It's 89.5 over 158.6.
Roger.
Can you go to READ momentarily?
We're READ. Roger.
Roger.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, go ahead.
Roger. Do you want me to keep my platform and computer up?
Turn off your READ switch now if you're reading.
Okay. I understand you got the reading. Would you advise me on the computer and IMU?
I see no reason for it.
Keep your platform powered up, Jimmy boy.
Okay.
Hey, Jim. We estimate you have 207 left in your OAMS.
Roger.
Okay. We'd like to have - are you still reading?
Roger. Still reading you.
We'd like to get a blood pressure on Ed over the Canaries.
He's unstowing stuff right now so you may have to wait a second.
Okay. We want it over the Canaries. You got a little time yet.
Roger. We'll be over there at 1:49, right?
Might be there a little sooner than that, I think.
Okay.
What was my G.m.t. at lift-off, CAP COM?
G.m.t. at lift-off was 15 15 59.
Roger.
Have you checked your cabin seal?
Roger. Our cabin is holding at about 4.9. What else do you want to check?
Check your water seal.
Water seal. Roger.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead Canary, Gemini 4.
Give me your Read Switch ON - correction, your Quantity Switch to READ for 10 seconds.
Quantity Switch is in READ.
Roger. We have your secondary Pump B on. Have you turned it on?
Roger. We have. Ed's trying to get the stuff out ... It's coming off.
Inflate the - - have the Pilot inflate his blood pressure cuff.
Can you stand by one, please.
Roger.
Cryo gage switch OFF.
It's OFF.
Flight advises if you're too busy we'll disregard the blood pressure.
I wish you would.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Request you turn your computer OFF, leave the platform powered up.
Roger ... computer's OFF at this time.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Is your water seal OPEN?
Gemini 4. Negative. Our water seal is not OPEN.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Your Water Seal Valve is to be OPEN when you start your pressurization and repress.
You want the Water Seal Valve OPEN when we start the pressurization. Is that correct?
Roger. When you start pressurization and the repress.
Roger.
Be advised we got the cable out.
Say again.
We just got the cable out.
It was a wrestling match, but I won.
Be advised that White had his left glove off for stowage purposes. I've had it off for approximately 15 minutes. This is the standard face-plate OPEN position.
Go ahead, Kano.
Kano, Gemini 4 here. Go ahead.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM.
Kano, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, this is Kano.
Roger, Kano, Gemini 4. I read you loud and clear. How me?
Gemini 4, how do you read Houston?
I read -- I read Houston loud and clear.
Houston, Gemini 4. How do you read me?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
... Houston, Gemini 4. How do you read?
I read you loud and clear, Jim. For your attitudes for EVA go ahead with the same attitudes you had planned. That's BEF and 180° in roll. That should be the best for photographic purposes.
Roger.
And to get pictures of the spacecraft, your best bet would be to move out forward.
Say again.
Your best sun angle for getting a picture of the spacecraft would be to move out forward from the spacecraft.
Roger. He'll move out forward and we'll be BEF upside down.
Roger.
Boy, is it crowded in here, Gus.
I'll bet.
Hey, Jim.
Jim, this is Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, this is Houston.
Gemini 4, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. This is Gemini 4.
Hey, Jim. You don't have to go upside down if you don't want to. You can go to whatever position is best for you.
We have no constraint on your attitude.
Gemini 4, Houston.
At this time we are passing over quite a series of thunderstorm cells, off at our ... Can you see it out there? ... it should be about your 1 o'clock ...
No, I can't see it, Maybe ...
Oh, those must be fireflies again! Are you in the light over there?
Yes, I'm in the light.
How does that happen? I'm in night over here.
We're going sideways.
Actually, we're going around to blunt-end-forward.
All right. A very interesting thing - Jim's got full daylight out his window, and I have full night out of mine. We're gradually yawing around to blunt-end-forward, and it looks like the reflection of the sun on these fireflies causes them to glow very brightly. That was the type of stars that we saw on our first dark side.
It seems very strange for me to look out Jim's side and see daylight and look out my side and it's just pitch black.
We've got an object out in front of us. It's not flashing like it's the booster. It appears that it's that type of an object unless it's picking up some glow from the sun. It appears a very bright, bright object.
We still have the booster at ... it was the booster. I can see the lights flashing on it now. It's just passing on the horizon. Just as it goes to darkness, the reflection of the sun on the booster causes a very bright image. That's the object I had seen earlier. It seems like we're still in fair close proximity of the booster, it looks like it's out in the neighborhood of 2 or 3 miles.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
Roger. Will you give me a - - correction, will you start pumping up your blood pressure. I don't have any T/M as yet. Are you in real time in that position?
Stand by.
Negative. We're in COMMAND. Let me give you a real-time hack position.
Roger.
Ed is off the comm. right now. He's trying to get his umbilical hooked up.
Okay. We need a blood pressure immediately from the Command Pilot.
Well, stand by one. Listen, you might advise Flight by way of land lines that we're running late on this thing. There's a lot to do and we're having trouble keeping track of all this stuff.
Okay.
I'll get the blood pressure as soon as I can get around to it.
Give me the switch position on your C-band beacon.
Roger. It's COMMAND.
Do you want it back on CONTINUOUS?
Affirmative. Back on CONTINUOUS.
Do you want them both on or just the reentry one?
Just the capsule.
Okay. The adapter's on. As soon as I get the blood pressure I'll give you a call.
Okay.
Full-scale on your blood pressure.
Can give the Quantity Read Switch for about 10 seconds?
Roger. I don't think you got a good blood pressure. The bulb popped off.
Okay.
Gemini 4, you are GO for EVA and decompression. Disregard the blood pressure unless you've got a few minutes and then try and get it for us. We'd appreciate it.
We don't have any time at all. We're really pressed here.
Okay.
Okay. After your first repressurization when you're about 12 to 15 minutes, we want you to go to BYPASS and return to FLOW after you repressurize again.
All right. You want us to go to BYPASS before we go to repressurize. Right?
That'll be after your first repressurization.
Say again.
Okay. Between your first and second repressurization, in that wait period, we want you to put your radiator to BYPASS and then to FLOW after you repressurize the second time.
Roger.
Okay. We're done with your Quantity Read.
Roger.
Okay. We're not going to say anything to you on the ground. If you need anything we'll wait.
Okay. Listen, has Houston been advised yet that we're running a little late and we might not be ready at Hawaii.
Okay.
Okay. Houston advised that if you are unable to make it, take your evaluation and we'll pick it up on the next pass.
Roger. Understand that.
All right.
That's what we want to get clear.
Roger.
Okay. You don't have to acknowledge this - you're in a 89.2 by 155 orbit and it's a 4.8 day lifetime.
Roger.
Turn your Right Secondary O<sub>2</sub> OPEN, your Left Secondary O<sub>2</sub> CLOSED.
Houston advises you can use any attitude you want for the Extravehicular Activity.
There was no velcro put on the outdoor 16-mm camera. We sure could have used it.

Gemini 4, this is Canton. Stand by for Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Do you read?
Gemini 4, this is Canton COM TECH.
Gemini 4, go ahead.
Roger. Houston asks your status and asks if there's any change in your Flight Plan.
There is no change and we're GO on EVA. We have the ... cameras, the gun, all the equipment assembled, we're completing the final suit ... checks, and I believe we'll be ready to go.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
Roger, Hawaii. Gemini 4. I'm reading you loud and clear.
Roger. What is your status?
Stand by 1.
Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Go ahead, Gemini 4.
Next pass around. I don't think we want to try it.
Roger. Understand - next pass around.
Roger. Gemini 4. We're happy with that.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Stand by one.
Okay, go ahead Hawaii.
Roger. Flight advises go back on normal suit circuit until next rev. Then go back over Carnarvon.
Roger. That's what we're doing right now. We just couldn't quite hack it.
Roger. Understand.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Standing by.
Roger. We're getting back into sort of a semi-normal configuration here. Anything you need?
We have nothing for you. I will check with Houston.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Hawaii.
Go Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Be advised you'll probably bring up your computer over Texas and they will give you a 4-4 load.
Okay. Very good.
That's all we have for you.
Thank you. We'll talk to you in about an hour and a half.
Roger. Hawaii out.
Jim McDivitt. Right now it's about T+3 hours. When we came off the booster at SECO, we had rates of around half a degree a second. I tried to damp them out and finally came off around SECO + 30 seconds. It seemed that as we came off we might have come off with some other rates. What do you think, Ed?
Yes, we did. I wasn't watching as we came off, but it felt like we did come off.
Yes, at spacecraft separation. It seems to me we came off with some rates, the direction of which I couldn't really tell, but ...
Felt like we went this way to me.
Yes.
We didn't get a linear type forward separation.
Yes.
As we got turned around, we came right on around, and found ourselves about 300 or 400 feet from the booster. I guess that was about right, wouldn't you say?
Yes.
I thrusted toward the booster about 5 ft/sec. My separation burn was around the neighborhood of 6 or 7 seconds. I thrusted at the booster for about 5 or 6 ft/sec and then watched it as we were separating from it. I thrusted about another 5 ft/sec. Looked like we started closing - we started closing from off to the side and at about 600 to 700 feet, I guess. If you think any of these numbers are wrong just call out.
No.
And then it looked like all apparent motion had stopped and we were probably closing. So I turned the spacecraft around and made an attempt to aline the platform. In the meantime, the booster started dropping down below us at a rather obvious rate. So I gave up trying to aline the platform to line up and thrust down toward the booster, and I retrofired slightly to slow down with it. Once again, it looked like our rates were stopped. But by now we had drifted out to about 1000 feet or so. We then tracked the booster across Africa pointing down at it all the way. We got in to sunset pretty quick and at sunset I guess we were at about 1200 feet, Ed?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Yes, we were in fairly close.
We were at 1200 feet and closing slightly.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
I'll get them.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
As we went into nighttime we were ...
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Roger. Jim, you're going to be live as you make your pass across the States this time.
Okay. Anything in particular you wanted me to say?
Suit yourself.
Okay.
Hey, Jim. Could you give me an idea of how much you - what was the ratio of your thruster use, how much you used your aft firing, and how much you used your forward firing thrusters back early in the Flight Plan?
Yes. I'll give you percentage. I used the top thrusters down for about 10 or 15 seconds, I guess. I used the aft firing ones almost the entire time aside from that.
Roger. I copy. Ten or 15 seconds on the down, almost all the rest of it on the aft.
Eight or 10 seconds on the forward firing ones, but that's about all.
Roger.
I might add that we have seen the booster. It continues to circle around with us, but it's just too far off to go get.
Roger. Hey, would you check your ACQ aid circuit breaker and make sure it's ON.
Make sure that it's OFF?
It's ON.
Okay. It's OFF at this time. It's coming back ON.
Okay. It's coming ON.
Negative. It's coming ON.
Roger. ON.
Righto.
Hey, Jim, you do have your computer ON, don't you?
Negative. I don't have it ON. Do you want it ON at this time?
Roger. Turn it ON. We're going to give you a 4-4 time.
Okay. I thought we were going to get it later. I'll turn it ON at this time.
At PRELAUNCH Mode.
Roger. PRELAUNCH.
Computer light is on. We're ready.
Say again, Jim.
I say, my computer light is on. We're ready.
Roger.
I think you did a smart thing back there.
Yes, Gus. It would have been a short flight if we'd kept chasing that mother around.
Yes. Sounds like you've been awfully busy the first couple of orbits, you know.
It would have been impossible. We would never have done the EVA at all.
We're finally getting a chance to look out here, Gus, and it's really nice.
Hey, Jim. Jim, this is Houston. Hey, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
How about describing the way the cockpit is laid out now, with all of your gear out?
Okay. Well, we've got to the get-out position here, and when we finally called it quits it was obvious that we weren't going to make it at that time without really rushing. I didn't want to do that.
Roger.
Ed has most of the equipment on him right now. I've got the gun and the camera and the hatch fitting, the fitting to tie the two suit hoses together. Ed has all the other paraphernalia on him right now, but he's on the suit circuit. He's got the Repress valve OFF and we're just about all set to go. I think when we get about over Africa we're going to go through the checklist again, and when we get to Carnarvon we'll be all set.
Roger. Have you taken any pictures yet?
No. As a matter of fact, we really haven't had time to do much.
You haven't had any time yet, have you?
It's a nice spacecraft though, Gus.
Good. Do you have the Shut-off valve on the chestpack CLOSED?
Roger. It is.
Okay.
Okay, did we get an update then?
Roger. It got in okay.
Gemini 4. Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4. Do you read now?
Roger, I lost you there for a minute. Say, you never did start to decompress, did you?
Say again.
Did you ever start decompressing?
Negative. We never started decompressing.
Roger, understand.
Houston CAP COM, this is Gemini 4. Looks like we're over Texas now, huh?
You say you're coming right over Big T?
Roger ...
See any of it?
Sure can. We're coming over the Gulf right now.
Right over Gulf, huh? Has your weather been good around the orbit?
Frankly, we haven't really had time to look out too much ...
Roger. Can you still see the booster?
I don't even know where it is right now, Gus.
Roger.
We saw it just as we went into darkness. We stayed with it all through the darkness ...
You're getting awfully garbled.
Roger. I say again. We saw it when we were in the darkness, but we haven't seen it since we came back out into the light.
Roger, understand. You saw it on the dark side.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Roger. We just switched remote. Is Ed still there?
Yes, he doesn't like to talk, I guess.
I'm sitting here enjoying the view.
Roger. Do you get pretty heated up getting all that gear on?
I got ... we got pretty warm.
How do you feel now?
Fine.
Good.
You guys had any water to drink yet?
Negative.
Hey, Jim, we figure the booster ought to be about 32 miles ahead of you and 5 miles below you at this time.
Thirty-two ahead and 5 below.
Roger.
We've got quite a good view of the whole state of Florida, and we're passing over it now.
You've got Florida in sight, huh?
We can see it from the top to the bottom.
Very good.
In fact, we're looking right down at the Cape now. You can see the launch complexes down there. It's quite clear.
Hey, Jim. Gemini 4.
Go ahead.
We'd like for you to turn your cabin heat exchanger ON until you get ready to decompress. And the fan.
Roger. We're not getting hot if that's what you're worried about.
Cabin temperature is getting up a little.
Okay.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
Go ahead.
This is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. How about turning the computer OFF again?
Affirmative, turn it OFF. Don't forget to drink some water now.
Yes. Can we turn the computer OFF?
Roger. Turn the computer OFF.
Houston. Gemini 4, do you read?
Roger, we read you. Go ahead.
Roger. How about turning the computer OFF?
Roger, turn OFF the computer.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Hey, your cabin temperature came down 10° since you turned your heat exchanger ON.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
As you come over Ascension I want to try to give you a check there. The air-ground remote hasn't worked too well today but we sure would like to get that one up.
Roger, we'll be waiting.
Roger.
Would you advise, we've both had a drink, and I had 10 swallows.
Roger.
We've got another sighting on the booster. It looks like it's just about horizontal with us and right straight out in front of us.
Small-end-forward.
We are going small-end-forward and it looks like it's very close to our orbit.
And it's at about 3:28 elapsed time.
The lights on the booster are still blinking. I can see them at this time.
We're just at 3+34 right now. Just going into darkness. The sunlight has been shining on the nose of the spacecraft with small-end-forward, just about. Actually, we're 30° left of being straight ahead, small-end-forward. And the way the sun was shining on the edge of the booster ... spacecraft was causing a reflection, just like someone had a mirror there and was shining it straight ahead.
Yes, that's what ... that last time, Jim.
A bunch of thunderstorms out on the horizon.
Okay. We get to Carnarvon at 3:58. That's when we're going to get our GO. We start our depressurization right there. What we're going to do is that we're going to open the Repress, tighten your helmet, ...
We've got one thing left to do in the steps. We've got to take these off, Jim.
Take what off?
The suit pressure lines and put them on the interconnect.
Yes, that's not yet though ...
Do you have the interconnect over there handy?
Yes, I've got it right here.
Okay.
This is in the egress.
All right.
When we start at Carnarvon.
Open the Repress Valve. Okay, this is what we're going to do. Helmet tied on?
Yes.
Right Suit Flow Control OFF?
Right.
Disconnect inlet and outlet ECS hoses. Remove your interconnect.
Okay, let's see. Remove the interconnect. Interconnect the two ECS hoses ... by your elbow.
Okay.
Pack Primary O<sub>2</sub> OPEN.
Roger.
Not yet.
No.
EVA Emergency Shut off OPEN.
Roger. Check the FLOW.
Check the emergency FLOW and then back to CLOSED.
Roger.
Recheck your suit, your pack, and tether.
Roger.
Recheck your face-plate closed and locked. Helmet locked, gloves on, inlet-outlet "Y", and ECS hoses free. And then I'll have a Command Pilot Suit Check, which I've already done ... on to check the flow. Hatch lock OPEN. Then you've got your other things to check. When we actually start the Depressurization Mode, Cabin Vent valve go to 2 psi, then we close the vent valve. Then we install both blood pressure pump plugs, which I don't seem to be able to find.
Gee, I don't even have one on my suit.
I don't have one either, Jim.
Swell.
Aw, baloney.
I sure don't see one.
Nope, I don't have one.
I don't either, unless it's up under my cover.
No, you don't have one, Ed.
The hole's not big enough but still you ought to have one.
Right.
Neither of our suits have the blood pressure cuff - blood pressure plug
And we just had a very pretty moonset.
Just a casual comment here. We looked out and thought we saw the horizon. It turned out, it was obviously air glow. We could see the stars well below its edge.
We'll talk about this some more later when we get more time.
We noticed the old familiar pulsing in the suits when we had the RECIRC closed all the way down and our dampers that time were open full in both suits. It was the same type of a pulsation that occurred in altitude chamber and which was, I believe, duplicated in the testing.
Cabin pressure seems to hold around 4.8 to 5.0, right on the bottom. Also, our Left Secondary Oxygen is pretty high, looks like it's up around 5400. Been that way ever since we started.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4. How do you read?
Loud and clear. Will you turn you cabin fan OFF, heat exchanger full warm?
Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.
Hello, Carnarvon. Hello, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Roger, Carnarvon. Gemini 4. How do you read?
Loud and clear. How me? Over.
Loud and clear.
Roger. Will you turn your cabin fan OFF. Heat exchanger full warm?
Roger.
Roger. We'd like a blood pressure from the Command Pilot.
The cabin fan does give a noticeable squeal when it's on. I notice now that the fan is off. I notice a definite decrease.
What's your status on EVA?
The status is GO for EVA.
Okay. You're GO for EVA from here. Stand by for decompression - correction, depressurization. Can you give us a blood pressure? On the Command Pilot?
The status is GO for EVA.
The cabin appears to be venting at about 5.3. Just heard the vent valve going ... for EVA.
Roger. I'm going to try to give you a blood pressure right now.
All right.
Okay. Keep coming, it's coming up.
You are up to full-scale.
Can you give me about 10 seconds on your Quantity Read switch, please?
Quantity Read is ON.
Roger.
Quantity Read is OFF.
Roger.
Okay. We got a good blood pressure from you.
Your Right Secondary O<sub>2</sub> should be OPEN and your Left Secondary O<sub>2</sub> should be CLOSED.
That is affirmative. That's the configuration. The left is CLOSED; the right is OPEN.
We have a GO to start decompression, is that right?
That's affirmative for decompression and a GO for EVA.
Roger ... call again near Hawaii.
Roger. Very good.
We'd like for you to turn your Quantity Switch to READ from now on until the end of the EVA.
Okay. I got it on.
I'll be standing by here on the ground and keep the conversation down.
Roger.
Okay.
Hatch lock OPEN.
Hatch locks are OPEN.
Okay.
Don your other thermal gloves. I guess you got one of them.
The thermal gloves didn't work out too bad, Jim.
Yes. Okay. We're going to vent the cabin now.
Yes.
Two psi. Did you get that, ... Ed? We're going to close vent valve and we're going to check those blood pressure readings that we have. We're going to check the suits for leaks at 2 psi. Check yours to make sure that suit ... one. Okay?
Ready to go.
Hear the valve?
Roger.
Carnarvon, do you still read Gemini 4?
Are we ...
Okay.
I hear it - I'll keep mine...where do you...oh, you want mine? All right, I'm sorry, Jim.
All right.
Okay.
Roger, we're in a vacuum now and the right suit is holding at 4 and the flow is satisfactory. I'm not overly warm.
Okay. We've got the cabin vent valve open ... cabin at zero. Time to unlock the hatch.
Roger. Time to unlock the hatch.
...
Well, the thing about it, I've got to do something with the cabin ...
Okay.
What are we going to do with ... ?
Hold on to it, cause I can't ... it.
...
What's the matter? Isn't it working?
Uh huh.
... work up here.
... unlocked ...
Yes, I know they're unlocked.
I'11 look again.
That's why I had these gloves made this way so I could take them off.
Right.
... you're staying up with it, buddy.
What?
That's up.
Say again.
They're both on UP.
Okay.
Now you have ...
I know it.
Three cycles.
Okay, let me stand by for a minute here and get the ... controls.
... to LOCK so we can get on it. Okay now, that's working.
Take it easy, Ed ...
Woke up?
Yes, just wait a minute.
Yes, but listen, don't you ... Stand by one, Ed.
Are they doing anything?
...
Are they moving?
No, they're not moving a bit.
Think we're ...
Hold these a minute, will you?
Just take it easy. If we don't make it this time, we'll make it next time.
Roger. Next time around.
Or tomorrow.
You can't see too well with that visor on either, can you?
They're both on UNLOCK.
...
Are they moving, Jim?
Stand by. I can't see ...
Negative, it looks like they're not moving at all.
Looks like that thing, isn't moving.
I'll take it easy a minute.
Yes, no sweat.
You know, it's a good thing we can't get it open and not close.
Yes.
Let's not leave it OFF.
I'm on LOCK now.
Where're you going?
This is the first time it's ever failed this way.
Sure is.
No it isn't either. It failed that way up at McDonnell.
So that it wouldn't move at all?
Yes.
So it was just free swiveling.
Yes, it - I know what the trouble is. It's a spring pushing it back.
I think it will be all right.
Let me go to MANUAL and ...
I got it, Jim.
Wait a second.
Okay.
You got it?
Yes, I got it.
All right.
Okay, now make sure you get that mother back on.
Back in LOCK.
All the way?
Yes.
Okay. You got it LOCKED, UNLOCKED all the way then?
Yes, I do, Jim.
They're all back in LOCK now?
Okay. I'm going to take it easy now.
Yes, do that. Now, I want to get the spacecraft right-side up and leave that last ...
What a view! By golly. You can see the black sky up above.
Okay, just a second. Let me get the spacecraft where I want it.
All right.
Door's a little harder to move than I thought.
Yes.
It sure is clear and crystal smooth.
Are we on VOX, Jim?
Something just fell out.
It was a bolt.
No, it was a big white thing.
It's my ... it's adrift probably, huh?
What?
It's my lanyard.
No, I thought I saw it floating away ...
Oh, yes. You can...
Okay, my visor's down.
Okay, take it easy.
Right.
...
I'm going out there to install the cameras, Jim.
Okay.
The sun's very bright back this way.
Is it?
Yes.
... your visor.
Got my visor down.
Your foot.
Huh?
You're going to have to watch your foot.
Okay.
You see, I have to turn all around to do this, Jim.
Yes, I know.
Just move it all over the equipment there.
All right.
I can see your thrusters firing.
We're taking some pictures now.
Am I clobbering the switches, Jim?
Yes, you're really all over 'em, Ed.
Okay. Hand me the umbilical guard.
Take it easy now. You sound like you're pulsing.
No, I'm in good shape.
Listen, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
You got it through?
No, hold on.
Roger. Got plenty of time. Boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Pretty neat, huh?
Yes, it's something!
Think we're T/M ... Here, I got one of your gloves ... I got both of your gloves.
Yes, I don't even need them right now.
Okay ... the T/M. They're calling back now.
As 'Ole Leonov' says, (illegible) work out in space. It isn't very much, but I'm doing something.
Pretty black out there, isn't it?
Yes.
Okay, I turned the camera off, so I would save it.
Oh, I just knocked it off the mount.
Did you?
Yes, I'll go back and get it.
Tell me. How do you like this glass?
That's fine.
You know, I'm kinda glad I got the visor on ... for the work I'm doing.
Pretty bright?
Well, I'm looking right into it.
Your jiggling around actually moves the spacecraft.
Does it? I can see it pulsing.
Okay. I'm going to feed the umbilical out.
Okay. Be careful you don't trip some of the switches. Let me give it to you.
Okay. Feed her out slow.
Okay. I've got ...
All right.
...
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Hawaii, do you read Gemini 4?
Gemini 4, Hawaii.
Hello, Hawaii. Hello, Hawaii. Gemini 4. How do you read?
Roger. Read you loud and clear. Can you give us a status on your decompression?
We're going to put you on RECORD so the whole world can hear this later on.
All right.
Hawaii, Gemini 4. Do you read?
You're on RECORD. We're on CONTINUOUS INTERPHONE-PUSH TO TALK. Still on UHF.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Very good, Ed. Very good.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you read?
Stand by one.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Read you loud and clear. What is your status on decompression?
Hello, Hawaii, Hello, Hawaii. Gemini 4. Do you read?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear. We're on VOX. I guess you aren't getting us on VOX.
Roger. We just now received you. What is your status on decompression?
Got the outside 60-mm camera mounted, and he's getting the gun ready right now.
Roger. I understand. Can you give us a reading on emergency O<sub>2</sub>?
Did you copy, Gemini 4?
Roger. You mean the emergency O<sub>2</sub> in Ed's bottle?
Affirmative.
This one's full and ...
It's 34 right now.
It's 34 right now.
Say something.
It's 34 right now. Hasn't changed a step. How do you read?
Roger. Read you loud and clear Pilot. How me?
Outside the spacecraft, as a matter of fact.
Roger. Understand.
Roger. He has the hatch open. He's standing in the seat.
Roger. Understand. Houston will give you a GO or NO GO to exit spacecraft over Guaymas. Did you copy?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead, Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Roger. Did you copy my last? Houston will give you GO-NO GO to exit spacecraft over Guaymas.
Roger. Everything looks good here. What do you think?
We're happy with it.
Everything looks good on the ground, Gemini 4.
Very good.
Our ECS is still good. It's reading still 50 percent. Looks like we're not even using any.
We concur on the ground.
When he's moving around out there, he's really rocking the spacecraft around.
Roger. Understand.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead, Hawaii. Gemini 4.
Roger. We just had word from Houston. We're ready to have you get out whenever you're ready. Give us a mark when you egress the spacecraft.
Okay. We've got our GO now. Is that right?
Affirmative.
Okay.
Be sure and give us a mark when he egresses.
Okay. We're still doing a little work right here.
Roger. Understand.
All right.
You're in RECORD and CONTINUOUS INTERPHONE-PUSH TO TALK. I'm on UHF. How are you doing?
I'm in good shape.
Okay ...
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. What is your status now?
Roger. We're about ready to start getting out. Ed just got one of his gloves back on. He'll put another one on and then he'll be ready to go.
I'm not going to carry it, Jim. I don't need it.
You're not going to carry it?
Okay. We're all set, Ed, right now. Ready to go out slowly.
Can you repeat, Gemini 4?
Yes.
Listen, do you want me to get the spacecraft in any other attitude or does this look okay?
Looks okay, Jim.
Okay. I'll tell you when.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Can you repeat your last transmission?
I'm ready.
Okay, stand by one. I want to get my timer set. I'll give you a GO in just about 2 minutes - or less.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
I'm going to have to let the camera run out because it's too hard to work.
Okay, just a second.
Ready.
Okay, go ahead.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
Okay. I'm separating from the spacecraft.
Okay. He's separated from the spacecraft at this time, Hawaii.
...
Okay. My feet are out.
Okay. His feet are out.
I think I'm dragging a little bit, so I don't want to fire the gun yet.
...
Okay. I'm out.
Okay. He's out. He's floating free.
Okay. I put a little roll in, took it right out.
Very good.
Am I in your view, Jimbo?
Well, you know I can't see ...
Don't sweat it. I'll come to you.
Oops! There goes your glove. Well, we'll just let it go.
All right.
Okay. I rolled off and I'm rolling to the right now. Under my own influence. There goes a - looks like a thermal glove, Jim.
It is, Ed.
All right. Now, I've come above the spacecraft and I'm under my own control.
It really looks funny to see my glove out there, Jim.
Does it?
Yes. Okay, I'd better get over. Okay, I'm coming over.
Okay. Stand by.
See me yet?
No, sure don't.
Huh?
Oh, there you are. I can spin around now.
Okay. Just a second. You're right in front, Ed. You look beautiful.
I feel like a million dollars. All right we'll pitch up and yaw left. I'm coming back to you.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Stand by. I get the swizzle stick out of here.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Okay. I put in a little bit too much pitch there.
The gun works real great, Jim.
Let me get over where I can see you, Ed.
Take it easy now. You're in a vacuum.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Ha! Ha? No, I want to get the spacecraft on the horizon.
All right.
Okay. I'll come in and take a look at you now.
Wait a second. Let me take your picture.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Just a minute - just a minute.
This gun is very good.
Is it?
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Yes. I've got me upside down. Now I see my glove is departing.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Okay. Don't fire the thrusters.
Okay. Don't. I'm going on. Who's calling Gemini 4?
Houston CAP COM. Has he egressed?
He's out, Gus and it's really nifty. Listen, our VOX doesn't work very well, and I don't seem to read anybody. You will have to relay. The gun works swell. He's been able to maneuver all over - out front, back under the nose, and he's back out again.
Say again.
... work very well, but I don't think he can read anybody. So I'll have to relay. The gun works swell. He's been able to maneuver all over - out front, back under the nose, and he's back out again.
That's great!
Ed?
Yes.
Let me try VOX again. Say something.
Hello, Gus. How do you read, CAP COM?
Hey, Gus, do you read?
I read you now, Ed.
It's not really working, Ed.
All right.
Okay. Listen, I still can't see you out there.
It's working. Keep talking.
All right. I've drifted off to the side. I think we're going to have ... I'm taking pictures now, Jim.
Gemini 4, it's working. Keep talking.
Okay.
Make that flag look pretty.
Yes.
Okay. I'm right by the stub antenna now.
Gemini 4, keep talking. It's working.
Okay. Let me get some ... to you, Ed. I ought to be getting some tremendous pictures of you. Let me try again with the Hasselblad.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Okay. I think I've exhausted my air now.
Okay.
Stay right there.
I had very good control with it. I just needed more air.
Okay. Stand by. Let me take a couple of pictures, ole buddy.
All right.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Gus.
Tell him to keep talking. We're receiving Ed through your VOX.
Are you reading me, CAP COM?
... Gus?
Okay. We're going to VOX now.
Okay, Ed. They're receiving you.
Okay.
Tell them what you think.
That's right, CAP COM, it's very easy to maneuver with the gun. The only problem I have is that I haven't got enough fuel. I've exhausted the fuel now and I was able to maneuver myself around the front of the spacecraft, back, and maneuver right up to the top of the adapter. Just about ... came back into Jim's view. The only thing I wish is that I had more. This is the greatest experience I've ... it's just tremendous! Right now I'm standing on my head, and I'm looking right down, and it looks like we're coming up on the coast of California. I'm going into a slow rotation to the right. There is absolutely no disorientation associated with it.
One thing about it, when Ed gets out there and starts wiggling around, it sure makes the spacecraft tough to control.
I feel just about like a ... commercial.
Is he taking pictures?
Take some pictures.
Okay. I'm going to work on getting some pictures, Jim.
Okay. Get out in front where I can see you again.
Yes.
I've only got about three on the Hasselblad.
Okay.
Where are you?
Right out in front now. I don't have the control I had any more without that gun.
Yes, I noticed that.
On the tether.
You've got about 5 minutes.
But I want to get out and shoot some good pictures. I'm not satisfied with that. Okay, I'm drifting down underneath the spacecraft.
Okay. I'm going to start firing the thrusters now.
All right. There's no difficulty in recontacting the spacecraft. It's all very soft, particularly as long as you move nice and slow. I'm very thankful to have the experience. It's great, Gus. Right now I'm right on top of the spacecraft - just above Jim's window. I'll bring myself in and put myself out into your view, Jim.
Okay. Hold it and I'll take your picture.
Right now I could maneuver much better if I didn't have the gun with the camera on it, because I have to tie one hand up with it.
Okay. Stay right there if you can.
Okay, do you want me to maneuver for you now, Ed?
No, I think you're doing fine. What I'd like to do is get all the way out, Jim, and get a picture of the whole spacecraft. I don't seem to be doing that.
Yes, I noticed that. You can't seem to get far enough away.
No.
Where are you now? Am I clear to thrust a little bit?
No, don't thrust now.
Okay. Ed, just free-float around. Right now we're pointing just about straight down at the ground.
Okay, now I'm taking a look back at the adapter and equipment back there. I can see the separation plane; it's quite clean. The thrusters are clean. The thermal paint, the thermal stripping looks quite good. Also, the velcro that we put on seems to be in good shape right by the camera. I'm coming back down on the spacecraft. I can sit up here and see the whole California coast.
Okay. Now I'm going to go out and see how much ... if I've got enough harness.
The sky sure is black.
Hey, Ed, can you see into the right-hand hatch, right now?
No.
Aw, shoot!
Let me work on back. Listen, it's all the difference in the world with this gun. When that gun was working, I was maneuvering all around.
...
Yes. Okay.
... contacted.
Yes.
How are you doing old buddy?
Pretty good. How about you?
Good. Looking right in your window.
Where? You're not even there. Are you there, Ed?
No, I'm moving out now.
Let me take a picture.
Okay, there I go. No. Boy, I sure could use that gun.
A pretty neat little contraption, huh?
Yes. All the strings that are attached to me tend to dampen out my travel on the lanyard.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Yes, I noticed that.
You've got 4 minutes and 30 seconds left.
Okay, I'm going to free drift a little bit, and see if I can drift into some good picture-taking position.
Okay. Here, let me control the spacecraft ...
Just for your information Ed, we're only down to 48 percent on our O<sub>2</sub>.
Okay.
ECS O<sub>2</sub> pressure is about 830, so it's staying right up there.
You know one thing about this. Where we have this tether attached, I can't get a good push off.
Oh yes, is that right? Where it's attached to you or where it's attached to the spacecraft?
Where it's attached to the spacecraft. There's nothing particularly to get a push off on. Now, let's see if I can get a decent push off. If I didn't have the gun I could do a little better. There just isn't anything to push on.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Ed, smile.
I'm looking right down your gun barrel. All right.
Let me take a closeup picture of you.
Okay. Just a minute.
You smeared up my windshield, you dirty dog!
Did I really?
Yes.
Well, hand me out a kleenex and I'll clean it.
Ha! See how it's all smeared up there?
Yes.
It looks like there is a coating on the outside and you've rubbed it off.
Yes.
That's exactly what you've done.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Okay. Right now, the spacecraft rates are up about 1 deg/sec in pitch and yaw, and about 1/2 deg/sec in roll.
I'm not satisfied with the pictures that I've gotten yet.
Okay.
Houston CAP COM.
We've been tumbling around. I don't even know exactly where we are, but it looks like we're about over Texas.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
As a matter of fact, you know that looks like Houston down below us.
I believe it is, Jim.
Sure is, I - hey, Gus, I don't know if you can read, but we're right over Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
That's right. I'm looking right down on Houston.
Run out and look!
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
My golly! I'm looking right in the bay there.
Yes, that's Galveston Bay right there.
Yes.
Ed, can you see in your side of the spacecraft?
Let me get a picture of it.
Can you see the camera here?
Yes.
Is it pointing at you?
No, not now. I'm out of it.
Which way?
I'm behind the adapter. I'm trying to get some pictures. I'm right above my hatch now.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Yes, sir. If I had about another couple of bottles, Jim ...
That would really be it, huh?
Yes. I'm still not satisfied with the pictures I'm getting. I've only gotten about three or four.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Is that right? I've taken a lot, but they're not very good.  You're too close for most of them.
Okay.
I finally put the focus down to about 8 feet or so. Oh yes, that's great, the clouds on water behind you.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Okay. I'm going to let myself go out now.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston.
You know, Ed, this thing about the reference we were talking about looks like it was sure right.
Out here you don't even need one.
Yes.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston.
I'm going out to PUSH-TO-TALK and see what the Flight Director has got to say.
Gus, this is Jim. Got any message for us?
Gemini 4, get back in!
Okay.
One, what are we over now, Jim?
I don't know. We're coming over the West now, and they want you to come back in now.
Back in?
Back in.
Roger, we've been trying to talk to you for awhile here.
Aw, Cape, let me just find a few pictures.
No, back in. Come on.
Coming in. Listen, you could almost not drag me in, but I'm coming.
You still have 3 and a 1/2 more days to go, buddy.
I know (illegible)
I'm coming.
Okay.
You have about 4 minutes until Bermuda LOS.
You have about 4 minutes till Bermuda LOS, Jim.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
...
Okay, okay. Don't wear yourself out now. Just come on in.
How are you doing there?
I'm doing great.
Good. ECS O<sub>2</sub> ... is back in order.
All right.
Lots of pressure ... 47 pounds ...
Roger.
The spacecraft really looks like it's out-gassing because all the - whenever a little piece of dirt or something goes by it always heads for the door and goes right on out.
Okay, let's - oops, take it easy now. Take it easy.
... I'm standing on top of it, right now.
Okay, ready on top. Come on in.
Boy, this load on our spacecraft is fantastic. You can put in a 2 deg/sec attitude change in nothing flat! Can't you get a hold there, Ed?
Yeah ... now.
Okay.
It's no sweat. Actually, I'm trying to get a better picture.
No, come on in.
I'm trying to get a picture of the spacecraft now.
Ed, come on in here!
All right. Let me fold the camera and put the gun up.
Gemini 4, do you read Houston?
Ask them about no. 8.
What?
Ask them about no. 8.
No. 8? Okay, how's no. 8?
Okay. Let's not lose that camera now. I don't quite have it. A little bit more, but easy, easy, easy.
Got it?
Okay, I've got it.
Okay, now I can enter ... It's just like we said ...
Yes, we sort of talked about that. But we sort of talked about that but they didn't have any place for the camera. Come on, let's get back here before it gets dark.
Okay. This is the saddest moment of my life.
Well, you're going to find a sadder one when we have to come down from this whole thing.
I'm coming.
Okay.
...
Come on now.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Be sure you've got those hatch dogs fixed now.
Yes ...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
I just took all that stuff down there and ... Okay, I'm going to PUSH-TO-TALK now. I couldn't ... interphone.
Okay, have any messages for us, Houston?
Are you getting him back in?
He's standing in the seat now. His legs are down below the instrument panel.
Okay. Get him back in. You are going to have Bermuda LOS in about 20 seconds.
Yes, he's coming in. He's having some trouble getting back into the spacecraft it looks like.
You got your cabin lights up bright in case you hit darkness?
I can't read you. Say again.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Give me a status.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, this is Gemini 4.
Roger. Is he getting back in, Jim?
Listen, we are kind of busy. If you don't really have something for us, wait a couple of seconds.
Roger.
Gemini 4, we have about another minute. Could you give me your status before ...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston. Give me your status.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Give me your status.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is 12 Echo on UHF.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
... reads, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Go ahead.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Go ahead.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. We read you once, go ahead.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM, Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM, Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Give me your status.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Give me your status.
Jim, if you're trying to transmit, you're completely unreadable. I'm getting nothing but noise.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Give me your status.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
That was something.
That was the most natural feeling, Jim.
Yeah. I know it. You looked like you were in your mother's womb.
I felt like ...
That's the same position ... that we're taking right now, you know this is quite comfortable.
Yes.
Now we got the UTD and all this other jazz.
And they're full.
Can you put that ...
...
I'm just trying to get them all out, Jim.
Yes, that's okay.
But you had a bag of that stuff over here someplace ...
Yes, I know it.
Did you get it right-side up?
Yeah, we're coming around slowly.
Okay.
I'll be going off COM here in a minute.
Okay. Now just take it easy when you pull that thing over because you'll really back ...
Easy, easy now.
Okay. Now wait a minute. It's hooked onto something down there.
It's hooked onto the junk. Okay, you got it.
Okay, what's this thing right here?
Gemini RCS scanner.
That's probably been knocked off during the exercise.
Okay. I'm ready to go off. I'll be off for just a couple of minutes.
Hello there.
I'm back on.
I'm going to leave this thing open 'til I cool off.
Let me help you.
Cabin reading ...
Yes.
Okay. Would you undo the tether to the arm rest?
Yes, you know that was a smart trick of ours, not going when the ...
Yes it was, Jim.
It might just have saved our cans.
It's not so bad down there.
Okay. We're coming right-side up again, I think.
Let's try to get hold of somebody and tell them.
I don't know what - who we can get a hold of. Let me check.
Who's knocking on the back there?
Ha! ha! ha! Here, let's put this away.
All right. Hand me ... all right.
Now let me hand you this stuff.
You know, I know my camera was turning. I could feel it.
I couldn't feel mine.
I didn't turn it on until we pressurized and then I couldn't feel it.
Okay. Would you look for the bag for that stuff.
Yes, I got it.
Lay it here.
You get the flight plan out and see who we can talk to.
5:15
Shoot! We don't talk to anybody until we get to Carnarvon at 5:35. Tananarive is ...
Houston, do you read Gemini 4?
Gemini 4, transmitting in the blind. We're back in. The cabin's resealed. We're all set and all safe.
We're going to do a delayed time tape playback over Carnarvon.
All right.
At about 5:33, just about 13 minutes ...
Right.
We are starting to get cleaned up, Jim.
Yes, we are. One thing, Ed. Just be slow, cautious and thorough.
Roger. I'm slow ...
I know you are. I'm amazed. I never thought I'd see the day you would be so slow.
You know that was just - we rehearsed this so many times.
Boy, it really paid off.
It's paid! Big dividends!
As a matter of fact, I think I'm going to tell Chris that on the radio.
Don't alarm them.
No, I'm just going to tell them some of that training just paid off. We could get the hatch closed.
I tell you, the work I've done with those Crew Systems boys paid off.
I knew this equipment pretty well.
Yes. You knew how hard you could hit it without hurting it.
Yes.
Listen. I'd like to have you take it easy on your visor from now on, too.
Yes, I did that just after we got in orbit.
I tell you. The day side just isn't long enough for EVA. You know that?
No. You have to go like gangbusters.
Are we on RECORD now?
Yes.
Yes.
Note that recorder. You just don't have time.
That looks ... on one ... I'm going to go to ...
Okay.
How's our voltage doing?
I checked them just before I went out. They were good. Controls 27. S-2 is 28. S-1 is 28. The main is 23. We're in good shape.
I'm starting to cool off good, too.
Okay.
What are you going to do with your sleeves, Ed? You still want to take them off?
I don't know. I could take them off and stick them above my feet.
We'll worry about that later. That's not ...
Yes. Let's not get encumbered any more.
...
Did you ever get your seat safety pin in?
No. I never even tried. I haven't done anything. I'm still all latched up.
I've got my shoulder harness on, my lap belt on, my life vest on, my ...
I had it in a hole there. What hole's it in? The hole's ... Like shooting in the dark. Ah! There's the hole.
You know, I looked down there. I thought I saw my D-ring sitting out. But I feel it now, it's in the housing.
No, it never came out.
I guess I was seeing some other strap. Man, I about ... when I did that. I thought I'd ... I didn't want to put my heel into it as I came in.
Wonder what that strap was down there? Because I feel my box is all closed now. You didn't close it did you?
No.
Guess it was some other - there were an awful lot of lanyards floating around.
You haven't gotten anybody, huh?
No. We got about another 8 minutes yet.
Coming up on Carnarvon?
Carnarvon? Yes.
I wonder if we ought to put our HF antenna out and see if that guy can call us?
No, let's wait until we get to Carnarvon.
Yes. Okay. Why don't we go ahead and do that? That might be a good idea.
Yes, I think it is. HF antenna's coming out.
I'll go to HF and give them a call.
Eureka! I got it in.
Gemini Net, Gemini Net. This is Gemini 4, Gemini 4 on HF. Does anyone read?
Gemini Net, Gemini Net. This is Gemini 4, Gemini 4 on HF. Does anyone read?
I think we are upside down, Jim.
No we're not.
I think we're right side up, Ed. The ball shows it.
No, we're all right. I'm sorry.
Yes.
The mirror was covering up part of it.
Gemini Net, Gemini Net, Gemini 4 on HF. Does anyone read on HF?
You know this Hasselblad magazine that has the EVA on it?
Yes.
On the ...
Right.

Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Hello Carnarvon, how do you read?
Loud and clear. How me? Over.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon. Read you loud and clear. How me. Over.
Hello Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Carnarvon. Read you loud and clear.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Hello Carnarvon, hello Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Carnarvon, Gemini 4. How do you read me?
I read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Loud and clear. It's nice to have someone to talk to again.
Roger. It's good to hear you. How are things going?
Okay. We are back inside the spacecraft. We are repressurized to 5 psi. We are not, I say again, we are not going to depressurize the spacecraft again.
Roger. Understand. How are you feeling?
Say again.
How are you feeling?
Everybody's fine. Feeling great.
Roger. Can you give me battery readouts please.
Battery readouts coming up.
Roger.
Before I give the battery readout, do you want me to stay powered up, or do you want me to start powering down?
Negative. I would like you to keep the power on your computer on until I update your time and load and then we will power you down.
Okay, I'm going to bring the computer on the line now. It's not on.
That's affirmative. I was just going to ask you to do that.
If your platform is off, you can leave it off.
... A is 6 and 1/2, 1A is 24 volts.
Say it again, please.
Roger. 1A and 1B are 6 and 1/2 volts, rather that's amps, and 24 volts.
Go ahead.
1C is 7 amps and 24 volts.
Roger.
2A is 7 1/2 and 24.
Roger.
2B is 6 1/2 and 24.
Roger.
2C is 6 1/2 and 24. And they look good. RCS A and B are both holding up fine.
Roger. We're going to give you a GO for 6-4. I'll update a 4-4 load for you with maneuver and 6-4 without maneuver time.
Stand by one, please.
Roger.
Carnarvon, while we are waiting for that we got all this equipment in the spacecraft right now and we are trying to get it stowed away in some reasonable pattern.
Okay, I understand. I am going to update your command load first and then we will copy the times when you are ready.
We are ready right now.
Okay. Transmitting a TR.
Got it.
Roger. Got it in.
And you got a valid 4-4 load without ... maneuver load.
Understand we're good for 4-4.
Roger. Okay. We are ready to copy your times.
Ready to go.
4-4 153. 3+18. 21 08 57. 3+00. 8+43.
Roger. Reading back area 4-4 153. 3+18. 21 08 57. 3+00. 8+43.
Affirmative. This will be done in the following manner. The burn, 110 aft, 43 forward.
Roger. 110 aft, 43 forward.
Roger. You can power down your platform and computer at this time.
Roger. Clear to power down.
Okay. You can turn your Quantity Read Switch to OFF.
Quantity's OFF.
Roger.
We're going to power down our rate gyros and some of the other things at this time also.
Roger. Do you want to copy down some 6-4 times?
Stand by. Ready - go ahead.
6-4 00.00. 01. 00 08 54. 8+12. 16+19. That's it.
Roger. Will you read back the Greenwich Mean Time and retro command on 6-4? I got the ΔV 00, ΔT 00. 8+12. 16+19. And I didn't copy on the retro time.
Roger. That is 01 days 00 08 54.
Roger. Understand 00 08 54. Got it.
Roger.
Okay, we've set your adapter C-band beacon to COMMAND.
Roger. We'll set it to COMMAND.
Okay. I'm going to cut it off.
Carnarvon, this is Gemini 4. It looks like our booster is still out there flashing away.
Roger. How far do you think it is?
I really can't tell. It looks like it is about 5 or 6 miles perpendicular to our Flight Plan. Maybe it's more than that. It could be as far out as 20 miles perpendicular to it.
Roger. Is your Adapter C-band in COMMAND now?
Roger. It is.
Okay, looks like I'm unable to turn it off.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
Gemini 4 on UHF. Do you read?
While I was outside I noticed on Jim's window - he's got a coating on the outside of it. One time when I brushed up against it with with either my shoulder or my arm it actually smeared right over on it, and it smeared the upper part of his windshield so that he couldn't see out. When I look out from this side, I can see that it is rather heavily coated with some type of material. When I was outside looking in, it looked like a - it looked like almost a greasy film on the outside of it. My window doesn't seem to have as much on it. When we have the sun on it...
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM on UHF. Do you read?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
This is Gemini 4. Go ahead.
Roger. Would you position your real time T/M switch to the COMMAND position?
Say again.
Would you position your real time T/M switch to the COMMAND position?
Roger. Our T/M switch is in REAL TIME and ACQ - is in COMMAND position.
Roger. Understand in COMMAND position. Also would like to know what time you closed the hatch.
Stand by.
Stand by a moment. We'll try to figure it out for you.
Just a second, Ed.
This is Gemini.
This is Gemini 4. Who was calling me before?
This is Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. If you copy, all systems on the ground look good.
It looks like in our power-down (illegible) we're still pulling just a little less than 11 amps.  We've got 10 on no. 1 and a little less than 11 on no. 2. The tether - the location of the tether or the umbilical restraint on the outside hatch made it rather difficult to do any EVA work as far as free tether aerodynamics out in front of the spacecraft. Whenever I'd be operating out in that area, the tether would - when it would come to its end would start me back and the reaction would carry me back up towards the - over the spacecraft and back toward the adapter section.  That's why I kept going out of sight during my maneuvering out there up above the windows, and then drifting back toward the back of the spacecraft. I continually had to keep pulling myself to get out in the front part of the spacecraft. I wasn't satisfied with the pictures that I was getting. It was rather difficult to keep any of the lanyards that I had on ... I had the lanyard on the gun and the tether and umbilical that I was on, and several other miscellaneous type lanyards flailing around and it was difficult to keep them from in front of the camera. You'll notice that perhaps in the pictures that I'll be moving my arms rapidly. I kept trying to move them out of the way so that I could take a picture. I'd say they were in front of me probably about 50 or 60 percent of the time; and the other percent of the time I was not in as good a position as I would like to be. I think I probably took in the neighborhood of a dozen pictures. It does seem quite easy to operate, even just with the tether out there. I felt no tendency to bang into the spacecraft. I was able to approach the spacecraft just about from any attitude I came back in - and sometimes when I was coming ...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead, this is Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. We would like to get a Medical Data Pass, Type 1, on the Pilot at an elapsed time of 6 hours and 12 minutes. That'll be over Texas. That will be about 21 28 00 Z. He can set up his oral temperature, and we'll give you a call when we have a read-out on it.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Go ahead, Guaymas - Gemini 4.
Roger. The Cape would like to get a Medical Data Pass One on the Pilot. Recommend he inserts the oral temperature right now, so we can get a readout over at the Cape.
Roger, he is inserting the oral temperature probe at this time.
Roger. We are planning a dump over Texas. Request you assume a heads-up attitude.
Roger. We are assuming a heads-up attitude. Be advised we do not have the exerciser out; we will not be able to give you the Type 1.
Roger. Understand.
Gemini 4, Guaymas. Are you ready for your HF check?
Roger. We are ready for the HF check.
Roger. Meet me on HF.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM on HF.
Guaymas, Gemini 4 on HF.
Roger. I read you weak but clear. Give me a short count.
I read you garbled. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Roger. Back on UHF.
Roger. How did you read me?
... alerting someone, anyone, on HF to let them know that we got back in, but I got no response at all.
Say again.
I say after we get back in the spacecraft I tried to call on HF to alert someone that we were back in, but I received no response.
Roger. I'll pass that along.
All systems are GO on the ground here.
Affirmative. GO.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. If you read, we have the oral temperature. The Pilot can remove the probe.
Roger, will do.
Okay, I'm reading you now. I have an onboard map update for you. The ascending node is 132° East. G.m.t. of the node is 21 39 00.
Roger. Say again the longitude of the ascending node.
Roger. It's 132° East.
Roger. 132° East and 21 39 00.
That's affirmative and would you put your ECS O<sub>2</sub> switch to OFF.
Which ECS O<sub>2</sub> switch to OFF?.
All right, that's the heater switch. Your waste valve Off. Your EVA bottle empty and ZIP GUN empty.
Say again Houston CAP COM. You're difficult to read.
We want your waste valve off, and empty the EVA bottle.
Roger.
Okay. If you don't have anything I'm going to turn you over to SIR JOHN for this Medical Data One, as much as we can get.
SIR JOHN, Gemini 4.
Okay, we'll turn you over to SIR JOHN, Gemini 4.
Okay. Ed, we understand that you do not have the exerciser out, so would you go ahead and pump up the cuff, and we'll do without the exerciser. We'll get a single blood pressure.
Roger, Ed. I'll be pumping it up again ...
All right.
Ed, we don't see any cuff response yet.
I pumped it all the way up.
Does it feel firm to you?
Yes, quite firm. I'm ...
Okay, let her bleed, Ed.
Roger, and we'll pass it on to you now. I've had about 12 swallows of water and I think Jim probably had 10. Also, we haven't eaten anything yet and we're awfully hungry.
Real great. Listen Ed, we want to modify the Flight Plan and we would like to have the sleep period changed here and let you get some rest. We'd like to have you go for at least 4 hours right now and it's perfectly agreeable with Chris if we go ahead and have Jim sleep some of this period, too if he gets sleepy during that period. It's agreeable to Chris.
Understand you'd like me to go to sleep for a little while.
Roger. We'd like for you to go to sleep. For 4 hours, anyway.
I'm not too sleepy; however, I'll ...
Okay, let's give it a try. Could I confirm one thing with you too, Ed? When you were EVA, we got a transmission that there was no disorientation, and that was affirmative for the entire time. Is that correct?
There was no disorientation whatsoever. I felt that I could either look down at the ground - I felt perfectly at home looking down at it - and I could roll around on my back and look up and it was not disorienting me in any way. The spacecraft was my best reference. Any time I saw it I immediately had a good reference and, in fact at times near the end I was using my tether and actually walking up and down on the surface of the spacecraft, using it to hold me down, as somewhat of an anchor.
Oh, that sounds terrific. Wonderful.
There just isn't any disorientation whatsoever.
Let's go on that sleep period. If Jim has no arguments about that, that's the end of the transmission here then.
This is Cape. Go ahead 4.
Go ahead 4.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Houston CAP COM. Gemini 4.
Go ahead, Gemini 4.
I would like a little flight information here ...
Roger.
Just what the plan is now with the fuel remaining, or how are we going to handle the fuel?
As best as I can tell you right now, you'll be able to accomplish practically all of the Flight Plan with the fuel that you have remaining at this time. We'll keep updating you in real time. Right now we want you to get some sleep. As far as your Apollo D-9 goes, it looks like you're going to be too far from the booster.
Okay, if Ed sleeps, and if I see it, I'll go ahead and use the sextant.
Right. If you do see it, you might unstow the sextant, but I wouldn't recommend you unstow it before you see it because it looks like you are going to be plenty far from it.
Okay, now I saw it on the last orbit so maybe I'll see it on the next one.
Gemini 4, from Cape.
Go ahead Cape.
Looks like we won one after all.
Ha! Ha!
Gemini 4, from Houston Flight.
Go ahead Houston Flight, Gemini 4.
Give us about a day to find the true anomaly, Jim, to see whether we can really do any of these OAMS retros. For instance 6-4, we didn't have enough fuel so there wouldn't have been any argument.
Okay, I'll go ahead and proceed with the Flight Plan as we've got it now. Is that correct?
Affirmative.
Thank you.
We had a couple of pretty exciting moments there, Chris.
Right.
Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead, Gemini 4.
We want to verify if you're off the long umbilical and back on your normal suit circuit.
That's affirmative. We've been off the long umbilical for some time. At that time we went off the umbilical onto the suit ECS circuit.
Roger. Have a good nap.
Roger.
Houston CAP COM, this is Gemini 4.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
Go ahead Gemini 4.
I never did understand what ECS O<sub>2</sub> switch you wanted me to turn off.
Roger. It's the ECS O<sub>2</sub> heater switch. Heater switch.
How come you want that off?
... says we won't need it anymore. The pressure will sustain itself.
Okay, fine. We're still up about 42 percent.
Roger, you're reading 42 percent.
It's now 6+35 elapsed, and I'm powering down the spacecraft completely. We had turned off the platform and the computer earlier after checking with ground and completing our EVA. I'm powering down the rest of it at this time.
I'm turning Biomed Recorder no. 1 off at this time. This is a change from the Flight Plan due to the different sleeping arrangements.
Okay, Blackie.
Ha! Ha! Ha! What are we going to do with all this stuff?
I don't know.
... ES sensor ... ?
Yep. Let's turn it off, too.
Let's turn it off.
The ES sensor is coming off at this time.
I think we ought to make a big effort to get a full meal at this time, Jim.
I think so. I'm about starved to death.
Ha! Ha! Bacon and egg bites.
Oh?
Yes. Ha! Ha! Ha!
For me, too?
Ha! Ha! Ha! Yes.
...
Can you keep all that stuff on ... ?
I swear, I get the feeling I'm standing on my head here.
Yes, me too.
Maybe it's because you're always touching the ceiling.
Yes.
Good boy! You putting some log data in?
Yes.
Back up that tape?
Continuing what I was debriefing about the booster, early in the flight. After we entered the darkness, at what I consider to be a distance of 1200 feet, I tried station-keeping with it, but the only thing I had to judge my distance from the booster at that time was the distance between the flashing lights. Occasionally they would - not occasionally, but continually, I would see one light, then two lights, and then one light, and then sometimes there'd be a long time before I'd see two lights - indicating that the booster was rotating all the time. I really didn't have too much of a clue as to which way it was going. Based on the distance between the lights, when I could see both of them, I felt that I was in a real good position with it until we got to about Carnarvon. At that time I seemed to be closing rather rapidly, although I couldn't really be sure of this. All the ΔV I'd added up to that time had been in the direction of the booster, or retrograde. Unfortunately, the darned booster would get in position such that if I were going to close on it, I would have to apply a posigrade to close, which then, in turn, caused me to once again depart from it after a period of time had gone by. Then with the 45 - 40 minutes of darkness, I really had a difficult time telling where I was. As we came out of the darkness, the booster was below me and pulling away from me quite rapidly. Ed, how far away below us do you think it was?
Oh, I don't know. I'd estimate it was probably out there a mile and a half or two.
Yes.
It's very difficult to estimate when it gets to be that far.
It certainly was. I sort of felt that it was probably between one and two miles, and I couldn't really tell how far out.
Definitely below me. I'd been tracking it below me from about Carnarvon on. Up until about Carnarvon we had it below us, and then up to the horizon, and then down below us again. It almost looked like it was in a different orbit than I was. It had a different apogee and perigee than what I did. Anyway, I attempted to close with it at daylight as soon as I could tell where it was. As I said, at that time it was a mile or two out in front of me - down below me. So, the more I tried to close, the less I really gained on it. I was firing retrograde. I was using my top thrusters to fire in such a manner as to decrease my total velocity, and then firing ... at the same time. I never really closed, and it continued to pull away from me. It became obvious to me that by the time we got to Hawaii that to close on the booster in time to do the EVA with the booster would probably take all the fuel we had onboard. In the ground rule we had agreed not to do this. So I checked with CAP COM and we decided to not go ahead with the booster portion of the mission. I don't know if I mentioned it, but when we separated from the booster, it seemed like our rates on the booster were low, on the order of a half a degree a second in pitch and yaw. I tried to damp these. I fired one impulse in each direction, and then I concentrated on coming off the booster. We came off, and we came off in the manner in which we generated some other rates. We came right-side-up, eventually, and turned around. Probably about a minute and a half or two minutes. It looked like the big problem was the time I took out to semi-aline the platform before we went into the dark side. We'd probably gotten right on top of the booster instantaneously. If I'd ignored the platform we would have been able to go ahead and complete it. On the other hand, I wanted to make sure we had a reasonably good alinement prior to getting to our 2-1 GO-NO GO point in case anything went wrong.
What's that? Gum?
Yes.
As the booster departed us, you could see the fuel spraying out of the roll nozzle. As the booster tumbled around, mostly in a plane that would be perpendicular to a line through the major axis of the spacecraft to the booster, you could see the long flowing tail that came out of it. I'm going to draw a short little picture of that on my flight plan. There was debris all over at spacecraft separation. We turned around and there were things all over the place. As a matter of fact, until we really got a good look at the booster, I really couldn't tell what was what. Fairings came off right at fairing jett with no problem. The horizon scanner fairings looked like they came off intact but I couldn't really tell because it disappeared out of sight so last. I didn't see the nose fairing come off at all.
I never did get an accelerometer bias to check on the platform. I was thrusting most of the time there, and unable to really settle the thing down for any length of time. We skipped a couple tape dumps I guess, because of the peculiar attitude that we were in. I could not contact Carnarvon very well on the first pass. It's a shame we didn't have a camera out right when we separated because ...
Boy! That was beautiful.
Nice. What? g?
No. That first view of that booster.
Oh yes. That was really nice, wasn't it?
That was beautiful.
That was really nice all right.
Just the way it should have been.
Just exactly!
How far out do you think we were when we first saw it? I think we must have been at least 500 feet out when we first got around.
Oh, we were closer than that.
Do you think so?
Oh yes. I'd say we were in the neighborhood of ...
Remember, it's only ...
It's 130 feet long - the whole thing, I mean. Just as a reference, from the pad to our spacecraft was only about 130 feet long.
Yes.
Okay.
I'd estimate we were out about a little over 200 feet.
Think so?
Yes.
Okay, I would estimate ...
Boy, it was sitting right out there!
... between five and six hundred feet, but certainly close enough where you could see it in all its clarity.
Going away and the tumbling was starting.
Right. It didn't take long for that tumbling to get going.
Interesting thing, though. The tumbling, really, as I could see, never appreciably picked up. It stayed there. It started out ...
You know what it looked like to me?
What?
It looked like it was tumbling in an oscillatory manner. It would tumble for a while and then it looked like, as it burped or the fuel came out or something, it would change its orientation and pull over in another way.
Yes, but it never seemed to go ... I timed them ... looked like ...
The rates ... Yes, the total rate never really seemed to pick up good in whatever it was. What was it? Eight seconds/rev?
Eight seconds/revolution. I timed them.
Okay. Let me write that down so we don't forget it.
Starting over the United States, actually Ed started unstowing things just as soon as we got into orbit. I think that we could unstow without jeopardizing the possibility of a safe 2-1 reentry.
What's that down there below us? Over there.
Looks like a city or something.
Are we upside-down?
I think we're pointing right down at the ground.
Ed started on unstowing stuff and as soon as we got to the position where it became no longer feasible to fool with the booster, I started full-time helping him - at least holding the things and stowing them away and trying to keep them from disappearing. The faster we worked the farther behind we got. Not because we weren't putting things the way they were supposed to, it just took a lot longer than we had anticipated. It really wasn't much easier at zero g than it was in the simulator, if as easy. So we worked all the way around. By the time we got to Carnarvon, I had made up my mind that we couldn't make it, but I thought we'd forge on a little longer. By the time we got to - or just before we even left Carnarvon it was clear to me that we could not make the depressurization. I called for a slip to the next orbit. We then ... caught our breath for about 20 minutes and tried to sort out the junk I had laying around in the cockpit. Then I got the checklist out and we went through the checklist again in detail to make sure that we hadn't skipped anything in the rush. Started the extravehicular - got the GO over Carnarvon. We were all set to go and we were standing by for the GO to start depressurizing. We got it. Went through the depressurization cycle. As we left Carnarvon, we were cleared for the full EVA. We got to Canton or Hawaii, and at that time were given - I believe it was Canton or Hawaii that gave us the GO to actually exit the spacecraft and start the extravehicular maneuvers. We accomplished this as indicated on our tape recorder that we recorded before and on the VOX position. We went ahead and Ed got out and we started to take pictures as we - how we would ... I initially held the spacecraft fixed for him. Then as he got out and seemed to be floating around in such a manner that I couldn't track him - initially, we decided that it was better to let the thing drift. Is that right?
That's right.
He was having difficulty maintaining his orientation, and it looked to me from then on he oriented off the spacecraft without regard to which direction it was pointing. He could actually impart quite high rates to it, as high as 2° per second. I intended to keep them below that level. As he got back into the spacecraft, we had a considerable amount of difficulty with the hatch. First we lifted the ratchet portion of the hatch to engage. After we got that engaged, we couldn't get the hatch down closed far enough. Actually, we started pulling down on the locking handles to get the dogs out. So, we had a rather exciting time and I think it was on tape, wasn't it Ed? I had the tape recorder on, I believe.
The tape recorder was on, but the red light lit there sometime. I don't know.
Okay. So it may be on tape and it may not. It went on for - I think we were 44 minutes after we started EVA. I was looking at my event timer which I had started when Ed exited the spacecraft. At 44 minutes we still didn't have the hatch closed. We were trying to take things calm, cool, and collected so we didn't get things all screwed up. And finally, by my pulling as hard as I could to get the hatch closing device, and Ed pulling down as best as he could, we were able to force him down into the seat and get the hatch closed fully. Ed seemed to be up much higher today than he had been in any of our zero-g EVA in the airplane.
Jim. I don't think it was the ...
Go ahead. Say what you said.
Yes. I don't believe we were actually having difficulty with the head clearance. I felt like I had plenty of head clearance and I could actually ... down and manipulate the dogs. We just seemed to have a little more effort in closing than we had ever experienced before and ...
It was difficult to swing shut because of all the washers that we have in the pyro lines.
Right. I was having to actually manipulate the gain dogs on the hatch each time that I stroked it, so that I wasn't able to pull as hard as I usually had been able to.  So we had to coordinate ourselves and where I would stroke down on it.  Jim would - I would instruct him to pull hard at that time and I know he was. In that manner we were able to get it started. Once these dogs started dogging down I had no trouble with the gain anymore, but I had to actually engage the gain as we had been instructed on the first several strokes to get it started down.
One thing that I don't know if we got on tape before, but both Ed and I mentioned that we were quite thankful for all the training that we'd done in the altitude chamber, in the zero-g airplane, and the crew procedures trainer there at Houston.
You're not kidding! I'll second that. The things that occurred were not things that we hadn't done before and things that we hadn't worked out procedures for before. The things that we did, I think, paid very heavy dividends today. I was very thankful for all the training that we had and the work the people had done with us.
Yes. I was thankful that we didn't have to make a reentry with the hatch open.
And another thing, I was glad Jim had been working with the dumbells a little bit to build up those muscles.
On the books, I think we want to be sure we put a little more care into the kind of rings we use. We've had difficulty in opening two or three different times now, and also pages are tearing out so that they are not staying in the book. We ought to look into some kind of reinforcement for the holes, where the rings attach. On the water gun, the little teat that sticks out the end of it to allow the water to flow out sticks in the OUT position, just like it did on the simulator, and allows water to flow after you take the trigger off. You have to, actually, from time to time reseat it back up in there to keep the water from flowing out of the capsule when you pull the gun out of the food package. Another thing, on the drinking hose, it's very easy to turn the hose in such an angle when you're drinking from it to keep the water from flowing through the hose. Actually, you crimp the hose right at the end, right where the rubber attaches to the drinking nozzle gun.
Gemini 4, CSQ.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Turn your computer on for an update.
Gemini, CSQ. If you monitor, turn your computer on for an update.
Roger, Gemini 4 here. Read you loud and clear, CSQ. Want my computer on?
...
CSQ, Gemini 4. How do you read?
Roger. Read you loud and clear. Turn computer on.
I've got my computer on. I don't have the running light on yet.
Roger.
Come right-side up for this load?
Say again.
I say I'm upside down. Should I come right-side up here?
Roger. You should be heads-up. We've got tape dump, also.
Okay.
And also get your Quantity Read Switch for about 15 seconds.
What is your status for 18-1?
18-1 is fine. We've got both RCS rings, two left secondary O<sub>2</sub> bottles.
Roger. Are you going to Main batteries?
Roger. Stand by one.
We have you GO on the ground here. Have you unstowed your bungee cord?
We just got it out now. We just tried to get all of our stuff unstowed, and we're not really prepared to do an Aero-Med Pass if we have to.
... we're getting squared away here. We're not really prepared to do an Aero-Med Pass unless we have to.
Okay. And we did not get a valid oral temp AOS anyway, so will need your Aero-Med Pass.
We've got a major housekeeping problem here with all this equipment onboard that we'd expected to get rid of.
Roger. Can you give us a blood pressure?
The main batteries are reading 9 amps and 23 volts.
All the main batteries are reading 9 amps and 23 volts, and the Pilot still has his blood pressure bulb in. Do you want one from him?
Negative, just the Command Pilot.
Okay. Just a second and I'll give you one.
Do you want our adapter readings? Gemini 4.
Roger, go ahead.
Roger. 1A is 3-24, 1D is 3 1/2 and 24, 1C is 3 1/2 and 24 1/2; 2A is 2 1/2 and 25, 2D is 2 1/2 and 25, and 2C is 2 1/2 and 25.
Roger. I copied them all.
Roger. We got a good blood pressure, also.
I've updated your TR clock with the 18-1 time; it's in and valid.
Stand by one. I didn't get my computer on.
We have to get the ...
Turn off the ...
Roger, CSQ. This is Gemini 4. Give me another update. I didn't have my computer all the way on.
Have you got a running light now?
Running light now. Roger.
Roger. Transmitting Gemini load.
Okay. We didn't get the DCS light. We're still not right-side up yet.
Roger. I got indications when I transmitted the 18-1 TR time that it did not go in valid.
Okay. We didn't get the DCS light.
Okay. Then you did not get the 6-4 load. The 18-1 GMTRC if you are prepared to copy.
Stand by.
Gemini, CSQ. Turn your Quantity Read Switch to OFF.
It's off.
Roger.
... 17 56 03. This is without OAMS. 7+47, 15+36.
Your first part was blocked out. Start over, please.
Roger. 18-1 without OAMS 17 56 03. 7+47. 15+36.
You were blocked out part way. Would you try again, please?
Roger. GMTRC 17 56 03. 7+47. 15+36.
CSQ, Gemini 4. You're cutting out in the middle of your transmissions. We're receiving the first numbers and the last numbers, but not the middle.
Roger. You got the GMTRC then. We'll get this up to you later.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Standing by. We have you GO on the ground. Do you copy, Gemini 4?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Roger. We have your T/M solid. Hawaii standing by.
For your information we're perfectly upside-down. I guess maybe, you pick up T/M even when I'm not right-side up.
Roger. I just sent your T/M command, real time on, and got it in. We're receiving your T/M very well.
... CSQ, back on the computer. We never got a DCS light anyway.
Roger.
We got a DCS light the first time, but I didn't have the IGS power on. And the second time, we didn't get the DCS light.
You look very good on the ground, Gemini 4.
Say again.
You look very good on the ground.
We look good on the ground?
Affirmative. You look good on the ground.
Okay, we've got everything going fine for us up here, except for all this junk we have inside.
Roger, I understand.
Be advised Ed is going to start trying to go to sleep at this time.
Roger.
Bacon and egg bites, toast and orange juice, and I'm about to go to sleep.
Roger from Hawaii.

Roger. I have a valid 6-4 load in my computer. Thank you.
That's affirmative. You can power down your computer.
Roger. When is the next time you want me to power it up?
It'll be quite a while. We have a long dry spell here. And we'll try to leave you alone and let you rest. You have a D-8 update. D-8 will be performed. Nominal time is 02+30 G.m.t.
Roger. I'm afraid that Ed will be asleep by that time, but give me that time again.
Greenwich Mean Time 00. Excuse me, that's 02 30 00.
Roger. 02:30.
Roger. And if it is at all possible, we'd like to have you put the EVA glove in a plastic bag and seal it as best as you can.
You want me to seal something up? I'm going to seal up the film that we just took. Is that what you want?
Put the EVA glove in a plastic bag and stow it away if possible.
...
We would like to analyze what came off the window.
You want to analyze what came off the window.
This is Gemini 4. I'm going to go off HF. Okay?

Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
Yes, Hawaii, Gemini 4. Reading you loud and clear.
Roger. During your pass we would like to perform a UHF check. I would like to stress - use minimum fuel, minimum fuel. Place your UHF Antenna Select Switch to REENTRY. Give me a short count.
Roger. I'll give you a short count here on the adapter. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - Now I am going to Antenna Select, REENTRY.
Give me a short count on REENTRY.
Roger, I'm on REENTRY now. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Are you reading?
Roger, reading you loud and clear. Now I would like for you to roll heads-up. Suggest using Pulse. Use minimum fuel. While you are rolling, perform another voice check on REENTRY.
Roger, stand by. I've got to get my ac power ON.
Roger. Also would like for you to build up cabin pressure to 5.4 psi using O<sub>2</sub> High Rate.
Roger, you want us to build cabin up to 5.4 using O<sub>2</sub> High Rate?
Affirm.
About 5.3. I'm going to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate now.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead Hawaii CAP.
Can you position your Real Time T/M Switch to REAL-TIME and ACQ-AID?
Roger. We're REAL-TIME and ACQ-AID. It looks like I'm pointed just about straight up at the sun right now. I'll try to roll around so I can see the horizon. I'll talk as I'm doing this. How do you read me?
Roger. Reading you loud and clear. When you get heads-up, place your UHF Antenna Switch to ADAPTER and give me a short count.
Roger, I will do.
I have my cabin up to 5.4 at this time.
Roger, I understand that you are up to 5.5.
Roger. It just vented and I'm back down to about 5.3.
Roger, understand. Go off of High Rate.
Roger, I'm off of High Rate already.
Okay. I'm just about upside-down now. About 120° bank. I'll start rolling around.
Roger, give me a count as you roll.
Roger. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Roger, read you loud and clear. Use minimum fuel, Gemini 4.
Were you supposed to get some retrofire times from RKV before?
Roger, I will pass up 8-C to you when we finish the Com Check.
Again, please.
I will relay Area 8-C to you when we finish the Com Check.
Roger.
I'm in about 90° right now and I'm starting to come out.
Roger. Still reading you loud and clear.
Okay, I'm reading you loud and clear, too. I'm reading you much better than I've read anyone else in a long time.
Roger.
Nice to talk to somebody, again.
Yes, you broke up on a couple of passes over.
Ed was sleeping. I didn't have anyone on the ground to talk to and it was kind of quiet. I should say Ed was trying to sleep.
Roger. Has he been sleeping?
Speak for yourself, Edward. Okay, I'm coming up to level flight at this time. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Roger. We would like for you to switch to ADAPTER and give us a short count.
Roger, I'm on ADAPTER. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How do you read me?
I read you a little broken up but readable.
Okay, I'm reading you loud and clear also.
Roger. I think this is about the best we've had - right?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Be advised to switch back to REENTRY. Did you copy, Gemini 4?
Roger. We're on REENTRY now.
Roger, understand.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Will you position your REAL-TIME ACQ-AID to COMMAND.
It is on COMMAND.
Roger. Roger. Now are you ready to copy your CLA 8-C?
Roger, we are.

Loud and clear.
Roger. Be advised that the oral temp is complete.
Roger, the oral temp is complete.
Roger. We'd like a blood pressure on the Pilot for an Aero-Med Type 1 Pass.
Roger. He's getting ready to do that now.
Roger.
We have another sighting on the booster, it's right on the horizon at this time. We're going approximately blunt-end-forward.
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. The cuff is full-scale.
Gemini 4, CAP COM. The cuff is full-scale. Did you copy?
Roger.
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. We have a good blood pressure. Give me a mark when you begin your exercise. Over.
MARK now.
Stand by. We have a small problem here.
... right now.
MARK!
We're complete.
Blood pressure has come up.
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. We have another blood pressure. Standing by for your food, water, and sleep report.
Roger, this is Gemini 4. Pilot got up about 20 minutes ago and had about 3 and a 1/2 hours of rest. It wasn't deep sleep. It was an on-and-off type sleeping, but there was some sleep associated with it. I had for breakfast, small cereal, orange juice, bacon and egg bites, and calcified ... bits. I've had 12 mouthfuls of water in just a few moments.
Gemini 4, this is RKV CAP COM. Are you prepared to copy some preretro updates?
Stand by just a moment.
Roger.
Roger, go ahead.
Roger. 9-Charlie 137. 2+02. 01 days 03 hours 40 minutes 03 seconds. 13+05. 93 00 00. GMTRC 01 days, 04 36 18. 7+59. RETRB 15+26. Do you copy?

Roger. Roger. Roger.
Starting D-8 experiment. Starting it over the chest at 59.
02 30 59.
Yes. 02 30 59. Holding it there for one minute.
Why don't you, between each one of these, turn it off, Jim. When we start going to bed ...
Going into the crotch area.
Okay?
Yes ...
Wonder if I should put my gloves on?
... not as comfortable. I'll tell you that.
...
I say, it's not uncomfortable with all your gloves and jazz on. I don't know. Maybe you'll be, but ...
Do you want me to help you take ... a little bit.
The what?
The top.
Yes, why don't you, and I'll stow it while you're in bed. Going to delay, you know, though.
Going up to the armpit.
Coming on back here. P Front of the window. P Front of the instrument panel. P Going to the floor. C If there's an experiment that comes up where you need me ... P D-8 is OFF at this time.  This run is completed.
I took an S-5 picture of a cloud formation over the Pacific coming on the Coastal Sentry Quebec area at 03:00 using f/11 at 150. It was frame no. 28. I'm taking several pictures for S-5. I'm right in the area of the tropical storm Carla. It's very heavily overcast right now. I'll take a few of the cloud formations. They have some very interesting formations interlaced on the top of them. Perhaps the camera will pick them up. It's so bright I'm going to shoot 250 at 16. Those will be frames 28, 29, and I'll be shooting at least two more. Those will be 30 and 31. I should be passing right over the area of the storm.
The Greenwich time is 03:18 and 25 seconds.
I'm shooting back at 250 at 11 now.
The Hasselblad hung up on that one. I don't believe it was a good one.
That was a good one.
The shutter to the Hasselblad seems to be delayed in dropping. I hope it's not ruining - occluding the pictures.
Looks like we're pretty well out of the typhoon area. I'll wait until I get out just a little further and try to get a broad over-all shot that covers the whole area.
Gemini 4, CSQ. I got cut up by Goddard loop. You say you didn't get a time of the hatch closure. Do you have some kind of an estimate?
Roger. I'll call you down one. Stand by. We've got it marked up.
Well, don't look for it if it's out of place.
Roger. It was considerably later than we had planned.
Roger.
Everything's going quite well now, up here now. Jim's gone on to sleep. ... four hours of sleep. I had a good rest, also and I'm preparing to have a dinner of roast beef and cream corn.
Roger. Roast beef and cream corn.
Roger ... over the hurricane, or typhoon area ... there right over Carla and ... which ones they were. I believe I got some good Hasselblad pictures of them down there, though. It was quite extensive cloud coverage from above and quite a few interesting formations.
Roger.
Will you pass on also, that we're delaying D-9 as our flight plan calls for because we feel that we both should be up for it. It requires coordination.
Roger. Will do.
Right now the pressure in the cabin is holding about 5.4. It seems to hold up there. That's where she went at lift-off. It seemed to hold there for a while and then it gradually drained down to about 4.9.
Okay. Okay, everything here on the ground looks real good.
Rog.
It was really quite a view out there during the EVA.
I imagine. Real good show.
How long did you stay out?
Must have been out - I came out just as soon as we got the GO. Before Hawaii, actually, I came out ... following the camera and installing the umbilical cord. It took a little bit of effort to get them in ...
Gemini 4, CSQ. We've got LOS.
Took another picture of the cloud formation at 03:35 ... a long drawn-out type formation.
One of the food bags has leaked at the inflow lid where you put the water gun.
I'm looking out at the stars now. it's not as - it's light, not fully dark. It appears that the window gives you a filter that cuts down the smaller magnitude stars. I'm looking out right now at the Big Dipper and right on down to Arcturus and ... and it appears to me that what I'm seeing right now are primarily the second and down to third order stars. The smaller ones are cut pretty well out of the picture at the present time. As you get deeper into night, I think more of them will come out, but you definitely don't see as many stars as you do flying at 40 000 feet in an airplane on a good clear night.
The stars of Corvus is right out in view right now. It seems to be in pretty full view. I'm picking up probably down to about fourth order stars right now.
As we get deeper into the night, the other stars are coming out. I can see them - I believe I can see down to about fifth magnitude now. It's still not as brilliant a display of stars as you'd see on a clear night at 20 000 feet out of the canopy of an aircraft. I've got my lights dimmed way down and it makes a much more spectacular view out. As a matter of fact, the stars seem to be coming out as my eyes adapt further. I'm looking right now at the Southern Cross and the stars around it. There seems to be a somewhat of a lighted area around it.
I've got a very clear horizon now. It's rather light and I've got a horizon comprised mainly of clouds. I can see the clouds - the stars as they start to go down into the main air glow, but the clouds seem to give a more light horizon. It doesn't seem that we - earlier in the flight we've seen a horizon without clouds and it was much more - it was a rather thick layer of air glow and you could see the stars as they went down through it. In this cloud-type horizon though, the stars are more difficult to see; although I do note that some of the brighter ones are visible through it as they set.
I'm looking out now at Grus, and its stars are quite clear, even the small fourth and fifth order magnitude stars in the ... This time of evening and at night, the skies are quite black and the stars are quite visible. I can see at least fifth order.

Roger. Request that you monitor primary O<sub>2</sub> source pressure, and go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate to hold source pressure between 930 and 960 psi. Do you copy?
Roger, understand go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate to control the O<sub>2</sub> source between 930 and 960 psi.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Roger. Go ahead RKV, Gemini 4.
Roger. I have a 9-3 update for you.
Stand by, please.
Ready to copy.
Roger. 9-3 04 36 19. 07+59. 15+47. Do you copy?
Roger. 9-3 04 36 19. 07+59. 15+47.
That's affirmative.
Would you relay to Houston that we were out over ... but we were able to see the coast of Texas quite clearly and actually picked up ... outside you could see considerably more ... coastline of Texas on up around into Louisiana ... coming on down over the southern part of Florida, I could see the whole state of Florida, and we went ... and about that time we had the command to start back in.
Sounds real good.
Quite a view!
Also relay down that control with the gun was ... very good in yaw, very good in pitch. Roll control wasn't as good but when I had the gun, I was able to pick a spot on the spacecraft and return to it. I was able to maneuver in translation and also in my attitude control ...
Roger. Understand.
... I didn't have the gun though, using the lanyard was a little more difficult due to the position on the spacecraft door at which it was attached. It tended to - like a tether will do, it tended to bring me back and rebound me off the ... door back toward the adapter quite a bit of the time, and I spent a lot of time trying to get out of that area.
Roger.
... I finished the dinner of roast beef ...
Roger, very good. Flight has been copying your transmissions.
Roger. Understand.
Looking at it now, right now. It's a ... triangle. I can see all three constellations, I think, clearly. The ... and Vega. In fact, I can see down ...
Roger, sounds real good.
... pictures.
I've seen quite a display of stars ... I've seen the southern hemisphere stars. I've seen the Summer Triangle, ... Vega, the Northern Cross. Looks like now I'm coming up - I can see ... I can see the ...
I believe that I miscalled a little earlier on the - that I had a cloud-deck horizon. I definitely don't have a ground-deck horizon. I can see down below thunderstorm activity and the stars sinking down through the air glow. So it's definitely an air glow horizon. And I estimate it to be approximately 11 to 12° angle, pie section, from my view. There's quite a display of thunderstorms down below right now.
It's starting to get light and I can still see quite a few stars. I'm going to try to see just what chance I have of seeing stars on the sunlit side of this pass.
Well, I'm back around now to the Southern Cross with the light splotchy area of - I guess lots of very light ... stars. I don't recall quite seeing the same display in the planetarium. Alpha Centauri and Beta are quite clear. I'm still at this time - it's starting to get light and I can still see quite a few stars. I believe they go down to about at least the sixth order now. I started up about the fourth and I'm down to sixth. There's really a lot of stars out in that ...
The light band of stars seem to - the stars right around the Southern Cross and the rather dark void area and the right - on the sign of the Cross and that as you get back toward Alpha and Beta Centauri the light area continues. It just looks ... a big patch of - oh, it looks like we're going to be late.
It looks just as ... It looks just like ... As a matter of fact, it probably is. It certainly is clearly defined, though. You can see the dark voids - a dark void area, ... in it.
There's the little Corona Australis, that we decided to use as a calibration. It's out in front of me right now, and they go down to fifth order stars and I can see stars that are distinctly of a less magnitude than the stars in the Corona Australis.
MSC-2 and -3 are being turned OFF at 04 19 40. I'm afraid I was watching the stars so much I forgot to turn it off at the proper time.
Right now it's daylight over on Jim's side, and looking out my side I can still make out some of the stars. It appears that you can keep the spacecraft oriented so that one side is dark. On the dark side you can see stars: but the other side is in daylight. Jim's side is definitely in the daylight right now and mine is in the dark. This is one of the things that surprised me the most earlier in the flight when I was looking out at all the little fireflies from the booster, and remarking how dark it was and how it looked. I looked over at Jim and he was looking out of the perfectly daylight window. That's actually the way it's supposed to be but was a quite interesting thing - the first time you see it.
I just took an S-5 picture. I'm just coming over the Sahara Desert. It's really a beautiful view. I'll take several more pictures.
I took two pictures - 45 and 46. I'm passing over Africa now, looking down at the Sahara Desert.
Passing over the east side of Africa now. I see quite a few ...

Okay.
Can you give me a new update for my orbital plot up here?
For the orbital what?
For the orbital plot. I need the ascending node of the orbit crossing the equator.
Roger. I'll check with Houston. Stand by.
It looks like I just passed over some of the Marshall Islands down there. They were quite clear and you can see the atolls and stuff around the islands themselves. I tried to get a picture of them, but I caught them just a little too late. They were very clear and quite easy to pick out.

Roger. We received negative C-band track over Ascension. Can you tell us what your attitudes were, please?
Roger. Say again, please.
Roger. We received negative C-band track over Ascension. We would like to know what your attitudes were.
Roger. Pitch at that time was - the small end was pointing up at the stars primarily, and we were in free drift. The blunt end ...
Roger. We got it. That explains the negative C-band track.
Roger.
It'll go 360° around when it's pointing small-end-forward, but when it's pointing up it's not too good, I guess.
Put a new tape cartridge at 06:00. I just took another S-6 picture. It was over the desert area showing the long longitudinal trim lines in the sand.
Took a second picture as I crossed the east coast of Africa.
Looks like I am coming right - I might be able to see the city of Mecca. It should be in my area. Might cross over it. The Arabian Peninsula -

I feel quite rested now, although I wasn't really able to get any good sleep. I had two meals. I had breakfast right after we got through with our EVA exercise and while Ed was sleeping. Then I had another meal, meal B. In the first meal I didn't eat the bacon and egg bites. In the second meal I think I've eaten all of it. After I woke up I had 10 swallows of water.
Roger. I've had 10 swallows of water since I woke up probably ... before I went to sleep.
Roger. Any other comments?
We managed to get the urine system, urine bags dumped, and we're in pretty good shape ...
Roger.
Roger, be advised that so far we've had to avoid ... any water floating around the cabin. I think that we're doing pretty well where we are.

... over Africa I took one picture ... I think that was exposure no. 53 in the Hasselblad magazine.
Now we're over the Mediterranean. It is very easy to recognize. I see a couple of very large ships. They start off from Beirut. We should be passing just south of Beirut.
I just took a picture. Frame no. 14 on the Contarex the same film pack we used for the EVA. There's the start of a long area of clouds. It appears to be cut-off between the desert area and the mountainous area that extends over China.
Now it's 07:55 and 1/2. I shot off the Contarex, trying to get Hurricane Babe. It wasn't very successful. The hurricane itself isn't very prevalent. Looks like another group of clouds.
Gemini 4. How do you read?
Roger, I read you loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear.
Roger, it's the clearest it's been.
Yes. It's very nice talking to people I can understand. It doesn't happen very often.
Roger.
I have a Flight Plan update for you, for ground elapsed time of 19 hours going on to 22 hours.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger, on Rev 12 RKV will update your PLA and CLA time; Rev 13 Canary Islands will have a C-band track. And also there will be astro-orbital nav check-run. No propellant usage for ATTITUDE control. This is a g.e.t, of ... or a G.m.t. time of 12 hours 16 minutes 00 seconds. Rev 13 tape dump over Carnarvon. After Carnarvon pass go to normal Flight Plan except when changes are required. Did you copy?
Roger, understand, at hours 18 to 22. On Rev 12 over RKV I will be updated with my PLA and CLA. Rev 13 over Canary will have a C-band track. At a G.m.t. of 12 16 00, I can do some orbit nav providing it requires no fuel. On Rev 13 I will have a tape dump over Carnarvon and I'll begin a normal Flight Plan after that time. Is that correct?
Roger. That is correct. Everything still looks real good to us on the ground.
Roger, it looks pretty good up here, too.
Roger, it would.
I think I've looked at the earth from every conceivable angle over the last 6 or 8 hours.
Yes, I can imagine.
Do you have some updates for us as far as PLA and CLA at this time?
Negative. We won't get that until the next rev.
Okay, fine.
It is really good to talk to somebody that I can understand and somebody that can hear me.
Roger, we are kind of in the same shape, here, sitting out in this boat. We have a little trouble getting communications with the rest of the world.
Okay, we'll get around to talking to each other for a minute because I can't talk to them either.
Roger.
How's the sleeping going up there, floating around?
Actually it doesn't go too well because unfortunately we don't have any way of shutting off the radio. So that when we are talking like this, Ed can hear you and I; although he has his volume down, I'm sure he hears us right now. And it's awfully cramped. We got all this extra equipment on board that we'd hoped to dump out and it is really crowded.
Yeah, man!
It seems like it would be kind of soft sleeping, without any weight or anything.
It is, but you still are restricted to a certain position just like sitting in a bus seat. Although you don't sit on your fanny, you still have to sit in the same shape.
Yes, I can imagine.
Gemini 4, Flight asks how are you doing as far as getting things stowed away and if you are getting a little crowded up there.
Yes, indeed. We are crowded. We have most of that junk down in our foot well, and I guess we are going to have to hold some of it during reentry.
Oh boy! That sounds like a lot of fun.
So far our major problem aside from the hatch and a few other exciting moments is trying to figure out what to do with all the stuff we've got.
Yes. Well, let's see, there's a lot of empty space out there around you.
Yes, and I sure wish I could get to it.
Yes, I imagine.
Flight advises that they have very good communications on this air-to-ground remoting and would like you to go over the problem you had with the hatch closure.
Roger. There are two gears that we have that go around when you pull the handle back and forth. One of them is the gear that sort of acts as a ratchet, a little cylinder with a piston in it and a spike behind it that engages the ratchet. And we were having a little trouble with that before we got it open and after we got it open we had difficulty getting this ratchet to work. Also, we had a great deal of difficulty getting the hatch closed far enough so that we could even start latching it. Then, Ed had to push the ratchet in with his hand on every go until we got the thing started. And I was pulling on the thing until I thought probably I was going to break a lug right out of the hatch. And we finally got it going, and it finally came forward. So I don't think we ought to try opening it up anymore.
Yes, Roger. Sounds like a good idea to keep it closed.
Rog. I'm not sure what the trouble was when we got down close but I tell you one thing, I'm glad that we spent so much time training in closing - opening and closing hatches.
Yes, all that extra training sure pays off at times.
Roger, Gemini 4. We're coming up on LOS here shortly. Anything else?
Gemini 4, RKV.
I just took a picture on the Hasselblad, Frame 54. A picture of cloud streaks over the South Atlantic ...
Frame 55 on the Hasselblad just as we came on to Africa. We had a very good high altitude cloud streak, it looked like - so I took another picture of the high altitude ones.
Over Africa now. I just took Frame 56 on the Hasselblad. It was a topographic feature. It looked like it had been an old volcano at one time and you could see the concentric circles on the top of where it had erupted a number of times or the way it eroded. 09:01.
... Film Pack no. 11 on the Hasselblad and no. 7 on the ...
I just saw the booster in the sunlight, at a distance I would estimate of 50 miles or so. Time is 09:16 and 1/2.

Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM, I have more retrofire data for you. Stand by to copy.
Roger, standing by.
17-BRAVO 87, 01+51. 01 17 26 03. 10+03. 18-1 04+14. 18 02 42. 02+44. 08+57. 18-BRAVO 85. 01+48. 18 57 42. 09+19. 19-4 137, 03+3 - correction, correction, 03+22. 20 50 11. 03+10,
08+40. That's it. Do you have it?
Roger, I had those, but I never did get 17-1 before. Could you give me - I got 158. 3+48. And I never got the GMTRC.
Roger. GMTRC 16 28 28. 02+39. 08+22.
Roger, I have them. Thank you.
Canary, what's my current orbit? Do you know?
Say again.
What's my current apogee and perigee?
Stand by.
Apogee is 155.7 - Perigee is 88. They will give you better data after they get our radar track.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.
Carnarvon, this is Gemini 4. How do you read?
Roger, read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Loud and clear.
Roger, will you turn your Quantity Read Switch ON, please?
Okay, we've got it.
Have you completed your M-3 exercise experiment?
That's just a medical pass.
All right. I'd like to read out this Primary O<sub>2</sub> pressure and quantity from you, please.
Roger, primary - primary O<sub>2</sub> pressure is 970 psi. Quantity is about 39 1/2 percent.
Roger, I copied. Thank you.
Gemini 4, I've got some times for you. Ready to copy? These are some changes to your Flight Plan.
Okay, go ahead.
We would like you to switch your ADAPTER C-band beacon switch to the CONTINUOUS position at 11 52 43.
Roger, C-band ADAPTER SWITCH to CONTINUOUS at 11 52 43.
That's affirmative. We would like you to come back to COMMAND at 11 59 23.
Roger, back to COMMAND at 11 59 23.
Affirmative.
I have a question, Carnarvon, it looks like we're getting back on the fuel line and then we are going to do the rest of the Flight Plan as originally scheduled. Is that correct?
Roger, that's affirmative.
Okay, my Flight Plan shows me going to sleep then at the elapsed time of about 20:30 or so. Does that still hold true?
That is affirmative.
Okay.
At the elapsed time of 22 hours we will take up the Flight Plan again. We will be back on the fuel curve at that time. Correct?
Affirmative.
Okay.
Oh, and I was also - can you hear me?
Yes.
Okay, I am switching the biomed recorders now from no. 1 - OFF to no. 1 - ON and no. 2 - OFF. The Command Pilot is going to sleep at this time. The time is 11:43.
Is the sextant back in the box?
What?
Where is the sextant?
Where is the what?
Sextant.
It's right down here. Do you want it?
Yes. Did we ever make the light work?
No.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon. If you read, will the Pilot please put the oral thermometer in his mouth.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon.
Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
Roger. Will the pilot please put the oral thermometer in his mouth?
Roger. Affirmative. I have the oral thermometer in the mouth. Do you want me to keep it closed for a few minutes so you can get a temperature?
Okay. You can start pumping up the Pilot's blood pressure, and leave the thermometer in your mouth. Don't acknowledge.
Cuff's full-scale. Okay Gemini 4, we have enough oral temp. Stand by for the Aero-Med.
This is Carnarvon Surgeon. Your blood pressure is coming ...
Gemini 4. Be advised the exerciser is over on the Command Pilot's side right now. I believe he's in a pretty good sleep. I'd prefer not to disturb him. Could I swap you this off and give you one when he wakes up?
This is the Surgeon. Say again. Is this the Pilot speaking?
Roger. That's affirmative ... The exerciser is over on the Command Pilot's side and he's asleep, I believe ...
Understand. Disregard the exercise at this time. Would you tell me what you've had to eat, sleep, and drink.
Say again, please.
How about an eat, water, and sleep report, please?
I had a very deep sleep and I woke up when the ... changed from two to one and then I switched it back to two and I went back to sleep again for at least 2 and 1/2 hours. I did not ... Jim had to actually blow reveille for me to get up.
You say you woke up an hour ago. What time did you go to sleep, please?
I was asleep 1 hour and I woke up at 11:30.
Was that 4 hours sleep at 11:30?
That's affirmative ... that was 11:30 and I'd been asleep for approximately 4 hours.
Have you had anything to eat?
No, I haven't eaten since I went to bed - just before I went on to sleep. I have had about 6 swallows of water since I got up and I drank ...
You haven't eaten Meal D? Meal D?
That's affirmative, I haven't eaten that yet.
Okay, fine. That's all I have. Thank you.
Roger ...
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead, Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Okay, do you have your gloves off?
That's affirmative. I've had my gloves off since ... I took my sleeves off after the first 4-hour sleep period that I had.
Roger, understand. I've got your Apollo Landmark Run One. Ready to copy?
Stand by one, please.
Go ahead, ready to copy.
Roger, Apollo Run One 13 54 08, northeast of track, 92 miles, and ... constraint on attitude control.
Roger, does the Command Pilot have his gloves off, also?
Are the Command Pilot's gloves off?
Neg - he put them on to go back to sleep.
Roger. Your Biomed no. 2 recorder should be on and your no. 1 OFF at this time.
Negative, we got a switch on that Pressure Regulator ... switch ... break switch has ... so that no. 1 ... and this is what the configuration is now, no. 1 is ON and no. 2 is OFF.
Roger.
You might check that for us but that seems to be a rather late change and that's the configuration that we've been running in.
All right. I'll check.
We want your recorders in the position you are in right now.
Roger, understand. We're in the configuration with no. 1 ON and no. 2 OFF.
That's affirmative. Very good.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Roger, Ed. I got a little information to pass along to you here - are you reading okay?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4 is reading you five square.
Roger, Ed. We want you to resume your normal Flight Plan. We base this on the fact that we feel that you have 205 ft/sec ΔV left and 63 revolutions you'll still be in a 81, 125.7 orbit. That will leave us enough for OAMS retro which we think will be 113 ft/sec at that time - are you getting this?
Roger. Understand we expect at the 63 rev to be 81, 125. We'll be required 113 OAMS approximately that time and we're prepared to go into our normal Flight Plan.
Roger. Your orbit isn't decaying as fast as we had expected, has a decay factor of approximately 0.8. So we are very happy with your orbit and we don't feel you're going to need an orbit adjust.
That's right, it sounds good. That's this streamlined Gemini capsule.
Also, this is based on the amount of fuel used up in your first orbit. We're using that as a basis.
Roger.
Go ahead and try your Apollo Landmark Identification, but remember, the thing is 92 miles away so don't use very much fuel looking for it. I recommend that you reduce your use of fuel from now on.
Okay.
You're starting to get broken up, Houston ... Houston do you read Gemini 4?
Roger, read you.
You're starting breakup; you seem to have a loud background noise.
Roger, I'll get these for you when we pick up Bermuda, then.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston, Gemini 4.
Roger. What is the condition of your fan there? Are you on one fan or two fans?
We are on one fan, we have been on one fan for the last 2 hours.
Roger, how's your comfort?
It's not bad. It gets a little warm in here. It seems to get warm when I go to sleep. I don't know why. It should get cold then, but seems to warm up then and we put them on for about 3 hours, two fans while I was asleep.
Roger.
It seems to get a little warmer in this bunny suit.
Yes, I'm not surprised.
Roger.
Okay, the last thing I tried to get to you before I lost you a few seconds ago was the judicious use of fuel. They think you have enough to complete the whole Flight Plan now.
Understand. Why don't you give us a call on these landmark sightings?
Roger, don't worry about that one in Africa because that is some 19 miles away and you are only 114 miles high at this time.
Roger, we will be looking for it. That's a real good one; we'll look for it but we won't use as much fuel. Looks like Jim's corked off pretty well. He hasn't stirred the last hour and a half.
Okay, I had a news release for him here, about Mike's baseball team. You want to take it and pass it on to him?
Rog, pass it up.
Okay, the Hawks won their Peewee League 3-2. They beat the Falcons. The Hawks got 3 runs on 2 hits, the Falcons got 2 runs on 3 hits.
Roger, understand, Hawks won 3-2.
Roger. Hey, here's the headline of the Post today; you might pass along also, sounds pretty good. The big headlines are "Aw, Ed, Please Get Back In the Spaceship."
What was that? Say it again.
The headlines are "Aw, Ed, Please Get Back In the Spaceship."
I'll give them to him when he gets up.
Say again.
Come in, Gus, I'll tell you. It was a little tough to get in.
I can't read you now, say again.
It was tough to come in and it was a little tough to get back in, too. But it sure was something out there!
Yes, I bet! I envy you.
Roger, it was really great. Were ya'll reading us? We never knew when you were reading us or not.
Yes, your VOX was keyed all the time and we couldn't get in or try to tell you that your time was up and to get back in. We could never get through to you at all.
Oh, is that right? I'm glad you didn't.
I could tell that.
It was difficult to take pictures out there with that rig, ... was fine. We tried to get some pictures there ... but we never did get with my still camera pictures to my satisfaction.
Say.
Reel on the outdoor 16-mm. We should be getting something with that.
Yes, I hope you get some good ones. Could you give us Quantity Read for about 10 seconds?
Quantity is coming for 10 seconds.
Have you had anything to eat yet?
I am in the middle of my first course of soup and I'm expected to get a little chicken salad and finish off with a fruit salad and orange juice.
Okay, we got your quantity, so we we'll leave you alone and let you eat.
Say again.
I said you can turn your Quantity Read OFF and we will leave you alone and let you eat.
Well, it was nice to talk to you and get all the news from the home front. As we went over Houston, I could actually see. When I was outside, I could see the Gulf and Galveston Bay and I could see right on up into Clear Lake.
Could you see the Domed Stadium?
I was looking for it but I couldn't pick it out. I didn't see it. Say, if I could have spent time looking down I could have seen a lot. I can see a heck of a lot more from outside the spacecraft than inside. Things are very much clearer.
Yes, I bet.
Really, one of the prettiest sights I saw was when I looked down and saw the southern tip of Florida and the island of Cuba and Puerto Rico and Santa Domingo. It was really quite a view. The colors of the blue and the blues as the water deepened out there, with the island was quite a view.
Hey, Ed, when you came over on the night pass could you actually see the buildings?
On the night pass?
Yes, you said at night view you could see ...
No, I couldn't. You might have misunderstood me. I couldn't see any buildings. And you might relay to the Australians that they're sure running up the electricity bill. I could see as we came over on this last pass. I could see the lights of Sydney loud and clear and the usual thunderstorms up north.
Very good. Hey, Ed, you were talking about walking on the spacecraft. Were you actually walking on it?
Yes, I was. I was using the tether to pull myself down toward the spacecraft and I was right on top of it, as a matter of fact. The next time I get into this type of tether operation - it looks pretty good but it still is hard to get any traction on the top, but if you pull yourself down you can get a little bit.
You forgot your magnets, I guess.
Yes. It looks like it will be pretty good on the adapter, too, so that might help a lot.
Yes.
...
We are losing you.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead, Canary, Gemini 4.
Roger, just wanted to let you know all your systems look green.
Roger. They look good from up here also. The O<sub>2</sub> is staying down around 940, 947.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. LOS-1. Do you have anything for us?
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Roger, Canary. Gemini 4.
We're coming up on LOS. Do you have anything else for us?
Negative, you just caught me with a mouthful.
I'm sorry.
No sweat. I'm just kidding you. Everything's fine up here.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM, over.
Go ahead Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
We'll let you know when we're done here. We're reading you loud and clear and you look real good from here on the ground.
Roger, everything's going smooth up here. We delay a little bit when we answer you because we turned our UHF transmitter on at that time and we need a little time to warm up.
Roger, ... the rest of the flight.
Roger, we are down at a minimum power-down configuration most of the time now, and whenever you call us, there's usually a little bit of a delay between our answer.
Roger, understand. If you have anything else, we'll be down here waiting.
You might ask ... if they can work up some settings for inside-the-spacecraft pictures; we have 200 feet of film. I have taken a few in here already, but I thought they might give us a suggested light meter reading.
Roger. We'll see if we can get it for you.
Also get a movie camera 16-mm setting for inside the spacecraft. We have a large bug eye, and we thought that we'd take some pictures with in inside if we had a little film left over.
Roger.
Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, go ahead.
Roger, you might relay that we saw the lights of Sydney. I don't know whether they turned them on or not, but if they did they sure ran up the electrical bill. I saw them on the last orbit. We went right over the town of Sydney and they were really loud and clear.
Okay, the people appreciate that.
... big electrical bill ...
...
Okay.
Gemini 4, CAP COM.
Go ahead, CAP COM, This is Gemini 4.
I'd like to give you your map update.
Roger. Go ahead.
Okay, Revolution 16, use 161 West, at a G.m.t. of 16 14 30.
Roger. Understand 161° West and 16 14 30.
Roger, and we'd like to know what was the status of the experiments MSC-1, -2, and -3. Recall?
Roger, we have been doing them as per Flight Plan. We left MSC-2 and -3 on after our thrusting a little longer than planned. We turned it off at about 4:20, if I recall right. We were planning to turn it off around 3:00.
Roger.
...
Roger.
Jim still asleep?
Say again, please.
Is Jim still asleep?
Roger. He's still asleep.
What's the housekeeping like in there? Have you got junk all over?
No, it's not too bad. We've got the bulk of all the extra stuff stored underneath our legs behind our heels, it's stuff you don't use very much anyhow so it's not much of a discomfort. But we've got the cameras and bags and refuse bags pretty well stuck all around on the Velcro.
Okay. Have you tried getting any of that stuff back into the AFT food boxes?
No, the refuse will be - we're planning to have a big dump back there into the right food box.
Roger.
Actually, it's not too bad.
Okay.
Tried to put that cable back, Ed?
Gemini 4, CAP COM.
Go ahead, CAP COM. Gemini 4.
Have you actually tried to put that cable back in the AFT food box?
Negative. I haven't planned to put it back there. I have no plans for it.
Roger. I understand you haven't tried but you have a place for it. Is that right?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Where do you have it?
I'm going to hold it in my lap during reentry.
In your lap?
Roger.
When you stow it in the back box there, it will take up just about the whole box and we would have to put garbage all over the place.
Okay.
After sleeping it over, do you feel any different about opening the hatch?
No, we're very definite about not doing that.
You think you can live with all that stuff in there?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Ed.
Gemini 4, CAP COM.
Go ahead CAP COM, Gemini 4.
Have you had any waste management problems?
Negative. We've dumped some bags. We've had a couple of other urine dumps - hasn't failed to dump.
Roger.
We haven't tried the bag yet.
Roger, understand.
Gemini 4.
Roger, go ahead CAP COM.
Do I understand - you have ... You have the umbilical under your feet now and you're going to hold it in your lap for reentry. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. We figured that's the best way as far as the ejection envelope is concerned.
Okay, but you feel it's pretty well out of your way under your feet now?
Yes it is. It's fine. It's under my feet, ... under there also.
Well, can you stretch it out, get comfortable or do you feel pretty cramped?
No, that's no sweat. I'm - I can stretch out.
Okay, good.
I've also taken my sleeves off and Jim's got those under his feet.
Roger.
We're very happy down here.
Roger, it's very nice up here, Gus. Everything's running right along.
Have you noticed any moisture problems?
No. As a matter of fact, I've been running faceplate open for quite a while just to take a look around and see if we are picking up any. In fact, the relative humidity has dropped a little bit in here and we have no apparent moisture anywhere in the spacecraft.
Roger.
Houston CAP COM. Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Go ahead.
Roger, Canary. Gemini. We're back on our regular Flight Plan, but at this time our Flight Plan goes in with not much detail as far as specific times. Would you relay to Houston that we'd like to have our Flight Plan updated with good, specific times as we go along to aid us in getting started on our experiments. They have the same flight plan we have. We'd like to have a bit of updating and bring the times up to date.
Roger, Wilco.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. You look good from the ground.
Roger, she's all in good shape up here.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead, Canary.
Our congratulations! How does it feel to have been flying for 24 hours?
That's affirmative, I was just looking at my clock up here now - just right on the second, isn't it?
Canary, Gemini 4.
Go ahead.
Roger, we got three more ... three more to go.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Roger, go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
Roger, read you loud and clear. How do you look up there?
Roger, ... looking good - everything is looking good - I got ... GO-NO-GO reports.
That's negative at this time.
Roger, that's all we can find.
Okay. You look real good down here.
Roger, I'm powered down - all the lights - looks like I'm pulling about 13 to 14 amps and everything is down. The lights are down, I'm observing the stars right now, and the Command Pilot is still asleep.
Okay, what did you say about the lights?
I have the lights all the way down and everything is normal in the spacecraft.
Roger, understand.
They don't have much of a change right now in the Flight Plan. They'll update you over the States.
All right, that sounds fine. I guess they got the message to keep the event times updated?
Roger.
I can't see down at this time. I'm oriented to look at the stars.
Say again.
I say, I can't see down toward Australia, this time - she's oriented up toward the stars - I've got your update.
Roger. I gave you a T<sub>X</sub>.
Roger.
You said the Command Pilot is asleep. He doesn't happen to have that oral probe in his mouth, does he, for a temperature?
No, I'm afraid he's not that cooperative.
Okay, we're getting a reading down here.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Roger, Ed. Will you go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate and bring your cabin pressure back up - if you haven't already done so?
Gemini 4, Houston. Did you read that?
Hello Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. If you read, use your O<sub>2</sub> High Rate to bring your cabin pressure back up.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
... Gemini 4.
Roger. Use your O<sub>2</sub> High Rate to bring your cabin pressure, if you haven't done so.
Roger. It's going up now. It's been holding in that vicinity, though, for some time.
Roger. How are you getting this relay?
I'm not reading you very well, but right now I'm pointed small end ...
We'll talk to you over the States.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4 ...
Gemini 4, this is Canton. You are coming in very, very weak.
I'm small-end-forward with the small end pointed straight up. I think that's part of the problem.
Gemini 4, this is Canton. I was unable to understand your last. Can you repeat?
Gemini 4, ... I'm pointed small end up; therefore you probably can't read me very well.
Roger, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Go ahead, Guaymas, Gemini 4.
Roger. We've got you green here. How are you doing?
Roger, fine here. Do you want the GO-NO-GO data?
Negative. Cape advises you are going to be live over the States. Do you have anything you want to pass on maybe, before we put you on radio and TV?
... please.
Gemini 4, do you read?
Negative. You were blocked out. Say it again, please.
I say, do you have anything to pass on to me before we put you live on TV and radio over the States?
Roger, I understand. Negative. Is there anything in particular that they were looking for?
Negative. I guess they just want to make you famous.
Oh yeah!
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Roger. We're giving you GO for 21-4, and we're ready to give you your 18-1 time if you are ready to copy.
Stand by one.
We're ready to copy. Go ahead.
Okay. ΔV 180. 4+15. 18 02 57. 3+06. 9+08.
Roger. Understand. 180. 4+15. 18 02 57. 3+06. 5+08.
Negative on the last. It's 9+08.
Roger. 9+08.
Roger. And 18-1 without burn is 17 56 11. 8+00. 15+41.
... 17 56 11. 8+00. 15+41.
Roger. 21-4 is 23 58 11.
Roger, ready to copy. Go ahead.
Roger. Understand sunset start time is 18+13, AOS start is 18+20. HF/DF is 18, HF/DF is 18+32.
... computer is coming up.
Affirmative. Sunrise is 19:07.
Gemini 4, CAP COM.
Go ahead, Gemini 4.
Hey, it sounds like a new voice.
Roger, I'm awake.
You've been asleep for days.
You are right. What were those last four times for?
Say again.
What were those last four times for - 17:31, 38, 48 and 16:58?
Okay. Your Night Check is to start at 17:31. Your HF/DF Check at night is 17:38 on and on at 17:48.
You get that?
Roger. We got it. I thought you said that my night start time was 18:20.
Say again.
Roger. You gave us a time earlier of 18:20 as the AOS start time for night.
No. 18:20 is the start time for your day check.
Oh. Okay.
Let me run down your day column end make sure we got it right.
Okay.
Okay. Start time is 18:13. Okay, then we go down to AOS times for HF/DF - 18:20 on the day. And then the HF - next time in that column on the HF - G.m.t. start time is 19:07. Still with me?
Roger.
Okay, then we take the night column - it's 17:31, 17:38, 17:48, and your HF - your sunset HF/DF start time is 16:58.
Roger, we've got them.
Okay. We'd like to know which light burned out in your sextant.
The light that burned out is on the readout area.
On the what?
... you read out the angle in.
Roger.
Hey, Jim. Did you sleep well?
Not particularly. I just rest, and I've been dozing on and off, but I really haven't had a sound sleep this last time.
Does the radio awake you?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it does. We ought to be able to turn it off completely.
Roger. Have you tried your fingertip lights in that sextant? Will that help?
No. We can find some other light. It just means that the operation is going to be slowed down, and I'm sure we can really do it as it was designed.
Okay.
Jim?
Go ahead.
Have you had anything to eat or drink since you've been awake, or haven't you been awake long enough?
Roger. I did not get all of that question. As soon as I woke up I had about 5 swallows of water, and I woke up in the middle of my nap and took about 5 swallows, also.
Okay. The sawbones advises you ought to go ahead and get something to eat now.
Roger.
You can turn your computer off now.
Okay, it's off.
Roger.
Did you give us a good load?
Stand by. Roger, we got you a good load.
Okay.
Gemini 4.
Go ahead.
We also got the 21-4 TR time in.
Roger. 21-4 TR time. Thank you.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead.
Roger. What is the status on your ACME or IGS power supply?
It's on right now.
Roger.
Okay. It's off now.
Roger. It's off.
Roger. We're going to have to put the ACME back on. We've got to go out HF/DF. Got to be right side up.
Roger. Understand.
A Flight Plan change. You will conduct the Command Pilot Type 2 Medical Pass at Carnarvon this revolution.
Okay. Command Pilot Type ... at Carnarvon.
Roger. You were garbled. That's a Type Two Medical Pass at Carnarvon.
Roger. Understand.
Gemini, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead.
Have you tried unplugging your headset at the neck since you can't get your volume all the way down with the knob?
No, I haven't done that. We'd like to continue to have communications procedures ... I don't think we want to do that.
Roger.
Everything looks good on the ground.
Roger, thank you.
It is now 17:21 G.m.t. and I don't know exactly which way I'm pointing, but there's a bunch of rays, all extending up from the earth toward the sky. It looks like it's probably the sunrise. The rays are actually sticking up vertically and I'm taking two pictures of them with the Contarex. It looks a lot like the Northern Lights ...
It looks like a rain storm with rain hanging out except that it's ...
How about yawing a couple ...
... the other way?
...
...
How far around do we have to come yet?
Can you see it?
What?
... parallel.
... to come around to the side?
Yes.
...
...
Those are the lights we saw the other night.
Was it like that, Ed?
Huh?
It wasn't like that.
... horizon.
... California.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. If you read, will the Command Pilot please insert the oral temp probe into his mouth. Do not acknowledge.
... a mass of lights.
Where is it, Jim?
We passed right over it. We ought to be able to see it. I think it's just a bunch of lights.
I'll bet that's it. I'll bet that's the sun coming up through the clouds.
...
What?
...
... all over the place ... and every time I came through here I could see some ... lights.
What?
...
...
Gemini 4, Carnarvon. If you read, start pumping up your blood pressure. Do not acknowledge.
A little bit higher on your blood pressure. A little more. Cut. Full-scale.
The unusual display of night (illegible) airglow combined with some Northern lights type effect occurring in 15, 16, and 17.
The whole airglow layer looks like a way out on the horizon.
Gemini, Carnarvon. We have a valid temp on the probe. How do you read? Over.
I read you five square.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon. How do you read?
CAP COM Carnarvon, Gemini 4. Read you five square.
Roger, looks good on the ground. What's your status up there?
Our status is GO.
Okay. Stand by for Surgeon.
Gemini 4, this is the Surgeon. Can you give me some information on your food and water consumption?
Roger. This is Command Pilot. I woke up about 30 minutes ago. Then I had lunch.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is the Surgeon. Do you read? Over.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Give me a readout on your food and water consumption ...
Roger, this is Gemini 4. How do you read?
Loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear. I woke up about 30 or 40 minutes ago and then - actually I didn't wake up right then - just sort of sitting there resting. I really haven't been having much luck sleeping. I had a drink of water when I first woke up, about 5 gulps. Then I had another one there about halfway through my sleeping period, about 5 gulps. I plan on eating something as soon as I get through with my HF tests.
Roger, understand.
So far I've been through three meals. I'm going to eat meal 4 on the first day.
Roger. Understand.
Doctor, be advised, I'm having a lot of trouble with this blood pressure cuff. I can't get it to stay in my suit and when I do get it in it doesn't want to bleed down. So if you see some erratic pump-ups, it's because I'm not having much luck with it.
Okay.
Gemini 4, this is the Surgeon.
Go ahead, Surgeon.
Could you repeat again what you ate out of meal 3 or meal C? Meal Charlie.
Roger. I ate everything out of it except the orange juice and I lost that some place. I don't know where it went.
Okay. Is that all you have had to eat since you ate meal Baker?
Roger. Oh yes, that's right, I didn't eat the toast either. That toast is the crumbly toast that we agreed not to eat.
Okay. So you ate the other items. Thank you.
Can you explain a little about this blood pressure problem? Are you sure you didn't have your thumb over the holes where the air comes out?
I have had the same problem ever since lift-off. I can't get the darn thing to stay in my suit. It keeps popping out of my suit, and then I have quite a difficult time getting it to bleed down sometimes.
We got a valid blood pressure but the temperature seems - the pressure seemed to hold up for quite a while before it began to bleed off.
That's right. Most of the time it seems to bleed out around where I plug it in rather than through the hole it's supposed to bleed from.
Okay, this is the Surgeon out.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. I updated your TR, they did not get a valid time in at the Cape. You now have a valid time for the 21-4. Same GMTRC relayed to you by Houston CAP COM.
Okay. I've got a good load for the 21-4. Right?
A good load and a good time.
Okay. I've got a good spacecraft so I probably won't need it.
That's the way we want to go.
Okay. Be advised the load in your computer is 18-1, with maneuver load. Your TR time is a 21-4 with maneuver time.
Okay, we got a 18-1 load and a 21-4 time. Right?
That's affirmative.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Come in, Hawaii. Gemini 4.
Roger. Be advised your two wives are at Houston and when you get best reception over the States they will be in communications with you.
Very good.
All systems look good on the ground.
Roger. Be advised, we just conducted an HF test starting at 17:31 and had no returns from any stations on the range. Do you know whether any of the stations are reading us?
Roger. We monitored you real weak on HF just now.
Roger. I understand. You didn't read us when we made our test then obviously because you gave us no response.
Roger. We were copying till you gave your test. We did not copy then.
Roger. I understand you did not copy us while we gave our test.
Affirmative. That is affirmative.
Roger. I guess Canton didn't either. We were just about right over them.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Roger Houston, Gemini 4. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Roger, you're a little weak but clear. I've got some updated Flight Plan information for you.
Stand by one.
Roger.
Okay. Gemini 4 here. Go ahead.
Okay. Delete the Apollo Landmark Runs 2 and 3. That area is cloudy and to help you on your Flight Plan there - Run 2 was to be at 28:30 elapsed time and Run 3 was to be at 30:05 elapsed time. Okay. The D-9 Experiment? Do it in drifting flight if you do it. We don't feel that you should waste any fuel doing this one.
Let's see - D-9 around 20 hours and 30 or 40 minutes.
Roger.
...
Okay. I've got a little news to pass on to you if you want it. PAO just handed me a news release to give you.
Yes, pass it on.
You want to know what's going on in the world? Well, the Astros beat Cincinatti 8 to 3. Rusty Staub hit a homer. And in your boys' team, the Hawks beat the Falcons 3 to 2. Mike walked twice, was left on base once, and was forced out - forced to second the other time.
Roger. He had a good night.
Yes. Okay, then. There were five air crewmen killed at Walker Air Force Base last night when a KC-135 crashed on landing. Most of the rest of the news is concerned with the flight, and you know pretty well what's going on there so I won't repeat that to you.
...
Say again.
I think we know what's going on.
Don't admit it if you don't.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. How do you read me now?
Roger. You're loud and clear now, Houston.
Okay. We've got your wives here, so we'll put Mrs. McDivitt on now.
Roger.
Jim? Jim?
What?
Do you hear me?
Roger. I can hear you loud and clear.
Boy, you're doing great!
Yes, we seem to be covering a lot of territory up here. How are you?
For me?
I say, how are you?
I'm fine, and how are you?
Pretty good. I'm over California right now.
Get yourself over Texas.
I'll be over Texas in about 3 minutes.
Hurry it up.
How are the kids making out?
Fine. They think you're at the Cape.
They think I'm at Cocoa Beach, huh?
That's where they think.
Is everything going okay?
Yes, beautifully. Beautifully.
Are you behaving yourself?
I'm always good. Are you being good?
I don't have much choice. All I can do is eat, sleep, and look out the window.
No room to move around?
What?
No room to move around?
Not too much.
Ed's cluttering up the place.
Turn the computer on.
Turn my computer on. Yes, ma'am.
Okay, sir.
Computer's ON.
Roger.
Is Ed awake?
Yes, he's here.
Be a good boy now, kid.
We're going to switch headsets.
Sounds like you've got your hands full, Gus.
Say again.
Are you on top of the situation? Keeping things straight?
Is this Ed?
We'll put your pad on here in a second.
Good morning.
You've got to push the button, honey.
Good morning.
How are you doing?
Fine!
You have to push the button when you talk and let it go so I can talk.
You're really looking good.
Roger. It's looking pretty good from up here. We're passing over - coming up on the West Texas area. We'll be over Houston in a minute or so.
Good.
...
Didn't hear you.
Patty, repeat it.
It looks like you were having a wonderful time yesterday.
Quite a time we had. It was quite a time.
I can't wait to talk to you about it.
How are Eddie and Bonnie, honey?
Fine.
Okay, honey. I'll see you later.
Okay. Have a good flight.
Thank you, honey. Bye-bye.
Bye.
Do you understand the fuel and ΔV situation? Did Ed explain it all to you?
Roger. I had it pretty well figured out, I think, before you called up. I've been plotting it on the board up here, and it looks like if we get to the end with about 135 or so, we ought to make the grade. Is that it?
Yes. That's about the way we have it here. Just be careful on your use of it, and we may cut a few things out of the Flight Plan, but most of them you can go ahead and do as planned.
Okay.
Will you be ready for your HF check in about 3 minutes or so?
Roger. We're all set.
Okay. Did you receive any HF at all?
Negative.
Houston, did you call Gemini 4?
Gemini 4, Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. You called me?
Negative. That was a mistake.
Okay. We're going to start the HF Test.
Roger. We'll be listening.
This is Kano on air-ground on HF. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Kano out.
This is Tananarive on HF. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Tananarive out.
This is Jim. I just took two pictures on the Hasselblad Back no. 7 and Frame nos. 11 and 12. Took two pictures of a sunset that just came up and we were approaching ...
...
At 36 1/2 ...
How much longer have we got on the ... ?
20 seconds.
Oh, there's the Gegenschein! Forward, Jim. Put the nose down. The Gegenschein should be right up there.
Where?
Toward the ...
...
It should be pretty close to ...
...
No, that's the ...
It looks like we're passing ...
... you're on that ...
...
Yes, just put it back.
Well, I'll take the food out, and I'll go to work and start stowing the garbage.
Okay. Let me ...
I don't know, but I think I might have to break down and defecate.
Let me put the ... in the ...
Okay.
...
... 07.
...
...
...
No, I think they're coming out.
No, I think they're coming out straight.
Let's ... just for kicks.
...
Yes ... okay.
...
No feces yet, huh?
...
Your behind needs that extra space.
...
77.
66. ...
...
No, I was just watching the pointer, I wasn't sure.
...
...
One more over here ...
77.
...
Okay, I've got lots of stuff to go in.
It looks like it would be a good time to take my helmet off while I do this ... take it off.
Are you going to take it off?
I have got to clean my visor.
... yes ... My nose is so dry.
... Ha! Ha!
What?
I can't hear you either.
Was it up in there?
...
Don't you think if we could get ... we could get something done ...
Oh, yeah? ... way back there now?
...
Push all that stuff over ...
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAW COM.
Gemini 4 here, Carnarvon.
Roger. Loud and clear. How me?
Gemini 4, Carnarvon. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Carnation. Gemini 4. How me?
Roger. loud and clear. What's your status?
How do you look up there?
How do you look up there, Gemini 4?
Roger. Say it again. I didn't read anything.
Roger. How do you read me now?
Sounds better.
Okay. You look good here on the ground. Are you ready to copy a block of updates?
Stand by just one.
Roger.
Carnarvon, Gemini 4. We're ready to copy.
Okay. This will be a little bit different. When I read you ΔV, the first two numbers will be forward. The second two numbers will be aft. The same thing with ΔT. The first group will be forward, and the second group will be aft. Do you understand that?
Roger. We understand.
20-4: 83 74. 2+18. 1+35. 22 24 30. 2+53. 8+40. 21-4: 83 93. 2+18. 1+58. 25 58 09. 2+53. 8+52. 22-3: 83 54. 2+18. 1+08. 01 16 49. 3+30. 8+52. 23-3: 83 70. 2+18. 1+29. 02 50 39. 2+52. 8+40. 24-3: 83 88. 2+18. 1+51. 04 24 20. 2+47. 8+49. 19-DELTA: 83 72. 2+18. 1+33. 19 53 19. 11+01. 20-DELTA: 83 57. 2+18. 1+12. 21 26 47. 12+25. 21-DELTA: 83 43. 2+18. 1+12. 21 26 47. 12+25. 22-DELTA: 113.

Roger. Reading back. 20-4 83 75. 2+18. 1+35. 22 24 30. 2+53, 8+40.
Roger. You don't have to read all those back.
Roger. You want ...
As you so desire, but we don't need it.
I believe I got them all.
Okay, very good.
There was one thing - that one you gave me, that was for 20 - it was the seventh one. Is that 20-1?
Was that 22-Delta 113 ft/sec?
No. It was the seventh one you gave me, and it was for Area 20, and what was the area on it?
20-DELTA.
Roger, Delta. I got them all.
Okay. Very good.
Carnarvon, can you give me a G.m.t. hack?
Roger. On my mark it will be 19:04. 3, 2, 1 -
MARK!
Roger.
Gemini 4, Hawaii.
Gemini 4, Hawaii.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
Roger, Hawaii. Gemini 4. Go ahead.
Roger. Be advised the Command Pilot has a Type 1 Medical Pass over Guaymas.
Roger, Type 1 over Guaymas. What's my AOS at Guaymas?
Wait one. 19 33 36.
33, Roger.
We have received the good blood pressure. We're standing by for your food report. Have you eaten since your Carnarvon Aero-Med Pass?
Negative, this is the Command Pilot. I just got the chow out, and I'm just about to set to it.
Say again, Gemini.
Negative, I have not eaten since my Carnarvon Aero-Med Pass, but I have the food out, and I'm just about to start.
Roger, understand. Have you had any water?
One very small drink, but I plan to have some water with my food later.
Is the Pilot asleep?
Gemini, Guaymas SIR JOHN.
Roger, Guaymas. This is Gemini 4 here. The Pilot is still awake. He's getting something to eat now too. As soon as he finishes, he's going to sleep.
Roger, Gemini 4. Guaymas SIR JOHN out.
Guaymas, Gemini 4.
Go ahead, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, how do you read Houston CAP COM now?
... make it work.
It seems like on the last roll, that the red light didn't come on at the end of the roll. We were running at the end of the roll when I noticed it, so we might have lost the tape dump between the last tape, 8, and the present tape, 6.
The O<sub>2</sub> pressure gage is unsatisfactory in many respects. Not only does it not have enough scale, but, in our case now the ... is set down low enough so that it is setting in the normal operating range. We're causing it to go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate all the time to bring it down.
Actually it's not the gage itself. It's the fact that the vent pressure is set lower ...
That's right ... bottles.
... vent ground -
It vents low in our cabin also. The cabin holds about 4.8 or 9 - normal.
And the cabin vents at about 5.3.
I can see them working on McDonnell now on this gain. I imagine there's fur flying. It's going to be when we get back. I'm going to hit them hard on it. I want to know just when they cleaned that. Remember? They were instructed to do it the day before the flight.
The trouble is, it wasn't only that, but just getting your whole hatch closed, it never ever took that kind of pulling on it before. That rubber must have gotten real hard or something.
Oh! You know one thing - see, I was giving you no help here at all.
You never needed to give me any help - before.
All I was doing was working this, and with the handle - I was fooling with the handle.
Yes, but you have never given any help before though, really.
In fact, you were saying, "Don't break the handle off!" Remember that?
Was I?
Yes.
On this one?
No, this one. You were telling me not to break that handle off?
I don't remember that, but sounds like good advice.
I was sitting in there. Heave! Heave! Ha! Ha! Ha! You remember that?
I remember the "heave" part. Too bad that wasn't all on tape.
If it is, it'd be tremendous, wouldn't it?
Yes.
That's what it took? it took both of us together to get it down.
Well, I was down low enough, so that the hatch had come all the way down and stopped.
I thought it actually stopped on your ...
On the head?
On your helmet.
I don't think ...
I pulled and you'd go down lower. Every time I'd pull, you would come down lower.
I was doing this; every time I came down lower, my legs went "boink."
Oh, yes.
There at the end, though, they were all right.
Not like in that zero-g airplane, is it? ... "Aw hell. Well, pull the hatch."
Yes.
Well, we'll try another parabola.
I think Tom better take a close look at it, too - with that chest pack.
He's a lot bigger than you are.
He's a lot less agile.
I wonder if we ought to ...
Yes, I know. You know how it is with that - that chest pack in there is tough in the zero-g airplane.
Yes. Well, you tend to always overrate our own abilities, too.
Yes.
Now I can see the stars.
No, but it's broad daylight over there, isn't it? Are we starting to go in?
Broad daylight over here.
We better vent one more time. That ought to get ...
I hate to see us using up our oxygen that way.
Yes. Well, we're going to use it up anyway. We don't ...
Want me to get it?
I'm going to start eating.
I don't know what happened. I got a head start, and you get the first meal.
It's the same meal.
The first one ...
Actually, we are behind.
Yes, we are ... 4 hours ...
... try to eat.
If you eat more, Ed, you wouldn't be able to do anything else. Isn't that the truth?
We are not permitted to do a whole heck of a lot. Actually though, our Flight Plan is fairly leisurely. We're not really ...
... S-5 ... Hello, Houston. This is Gemini 4.
You're broken up a little bit, but I can read you. Be advised we vented our ECS pressure down to about 910, 920.
...
We really ought to be keeping better track where we are and where our retrofire points are.
Yes.
I don't know, there is not anything very difficult about it, though. There are just the times.
Did I hear somebody call Gemini 4?
Where is the Contarex? See it lately?
It used to be over here. I don't know where it is now.
I see it.
You want it?
Yes.
Let me put this over here for a minute, Jim.
Yes, why don't we just put it there?
I've got to lean forward a minute to get to this umbilical.
Here's your Contarex.
Oh. The settings for the Contarex in the cabin - I wrote down and I'll get them and show you where they are.
Okay. The 16-mm is f/11, if it's right in front of you, and f/28 if it's otherwise. The 35 is - with the ASA 200, which we have two rolls of - is 1/250 f/11 and ...
Okay. Which Biomed recorder is on now?
Right now mine is on.
And yours is off.
Mine is on. I turned yours off as you got up.
You're wearing yours out. You're using yours too much ...
All right.
As soon as you wake up turn it off for quite a while.
Doggone it ...
Couldn't hear you.
... boy. You know, the food you can get is your whole ...
...
You notice that (illegible)
You know this is a lot of trouble, but still you end up getting a lot of moisture and stuff with it, too.
...
I highly recommend it on the long flight.
Something to do.
Yes, and I don't know what in the world, - where they can fit all this stuff.
What do you want to do? Just ... on your and ... drink?
Yes ...
This isn't recommended with ... gloves on, at all.
Are you going to sleep a little while, or are you going to ... ?
Yes, I think I will sleep. Go ahead and move around a little bit if you want to.
I tell you, I like it better in here with the visor open.
You know what?
What?
I think that I'll take a little more of that ...
Eye stuff?
Yes, with my helmet visor closed ...
...
You know, maybe that's why we sleep decently for a while and then - CRUSH!
Let's see what I can rig up with my faceplate open.
... water.
I wonder. Our relative humidity is fine, Jim.
We've been ... around with our faceplates open a lot.
Actually, this relative humidity gage is kind of nice. It allows you to keep a tab on what's going on.
Yes. This padded stuff might have bought us a little protection on the water problem and another problem with it though.
What's that?
The ammonia stuff.
... anything ... ammonia ...
That's the way it was explained, anyhow.
Do you want to try closing the faceplates and ... ?
You know, it doesn't bother me. I feel lousy every time I wake up. It takes you a while to get feeling good again.
Here's the data book.
... bag, but I don't know what I'm going to do with it.
Which one? Oh, those ...
Aw shoot!
I wonder if we should dismantle the ... what did you do with it?
It's up in a bag behind my shoulder.
Where, the lens?
You don't have to dismantle it, Jim. The lens is right here.
I know. I said, "Where is it?"
The lens is right here.
There's no need to really dismantle the other one if it works.
No, that will fit that lens.
No, I wasn't worried about the lens. I was worried about the camera.
Oh.
We've got a lot of movie film we might as well take.
We've got a lot of other kinds of film we better take ...
The only thing, we're not keeping good books on it right now.
You're telling me! It's lousy!
You keep books and then you miss other things.
We've been using the blank paper ...
I think we've missed a section, though.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead, Carnarvon. This is Gemini 4.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. You're looking good here on the ground. How are you up there?
Everything is fine.
Pilot still asleep?
Went to sleep about 15 or 20 minutes ago.
Roger. Can you give me the attitudes you were holding when you went past Ascension?
How long ago did I go past Ascension?
Oh, let me figure it out here. Hold a second.
About 20 minutes ago.
I can't tell you.
Okay. Did you hear Cape CAP COM talking - Houston CAP COM to you on air-ground transfer over Ascension?
Roger. I did. He came in for about two or three transmissions, and then that was all I got.
Roger, was he pretty garbled?
Yes, he was. And as a matter of fact, now that you mention it, I wasn't parallel to the ground. I was, I think, maybe pointing just about straight up.
Roger. Your nose was straight up.
Just about like that. However, right now I'm pointing about straight down so we're in pretty good shape.
Roger. I'm receiving you now, better than we have on almost any pass.
Okay. Stand by. I think we're also on the adapter antenna here.
Roger.
Yes, we went to adapter when we started playing with the HF check, and we just left it there. And it seems to be working just as well as the reentry does.
Roger. Seems a little bit better here.
Yes, we sure had a lot of radio trouble to start with, but it seems to have all smoothed out.
That's the way we want to go.
Hope things get better, and not worse, huh?
Say again.
As long as things get better, instead of worse.
Let's give that stub antenna a try. If you don't read me in about 10 seconds, come back to this frequency on this antenna.
Gemini 4 here, how do you read me on my nose?
Okay, I read you just slightly garbled. How me? Over.
Loud and clear.
Okay. Let's go back to the antenna again.
The adapter.
Roger. On the adapter. How do you read me now?
It's just about the same.
How do you read Gemini 4 now?
Okay. We'd like you to go back to the nose stub antenna.
Carnarvon, Gemini 4. You're all broken up now.
Roger. Will you switch back to your nose stub antenna.
How do you read me?
I read you loud and clear. I'm back on the nose antenna.
Okay. Will you remain on that antenna, please?
Okee-doke.
Okay.
Okay. We don't have anything else for you. We'll be standing by if you have anything you want to say.
Okay. Fine.
...
... Hawaii ...
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Go ahead, Guaymas. Gemini 4.
Roger. We've got you green, how are you doing up there?
Fine. I just saw something else up here with me, but just as I was getting close enough to it to take a good picture, the sun got in the way and I lost it.
Roger. We got some flight plan changes for you. Want to stand by to copy?
Yes. Stand by and let me see if I can find this thing again.
... and there are a great number of thunderstorms around at the present time. Lightning is actually lighting up the interior of the spacecraft ... activity ... thunderstorms ...
Okay. Go ahead. It doesn't look like I'm going to see him again.
Roger. First item, delete D-8 at 23 hrs G.m.t.
What is its elapsed time?
It's 31:45, elapsed time.
What is it in G.m.t.?
23:00 G.m.t.
Okay. Got that?
Perform the D-8 that was scheduled for 33:20 elapsed time - perform that at G.m.t. 40:00.
Okay. Delete D-8 at 33:20 and perform it at 40 00. Is that right?
That's 00:40.
My fault. Did you copy that?
Okay. Third item scheduled do D-8, start time of 02:15 G.m.t.
Okay. We'll have a new D-8 at 02:15 G.m.t. How many D-8's did we delete?
We deleted one; the one at 23:00 G.m.t.
Roger. Thank you.
You deleted that one and then put in the new one at 02:15?
That's affirmative.
Perform S-6 at 00:15 G.m.t.
That was S-6 at what time?
00:15 G.m.t.
We want you to use minimum fuel on that one.
Roger. Use minimum fuel on all of them.
Roger. Roger.
... at 22:35 G.m.t.
... you want S-6, one at 00:15 and one at 22:35. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Roger. S-6 is a cellular cloud formation.
Roger.
That's the one at 00:15 G.m.t.
Okay. MSC Experiments 2 and 3 at a G.m.t. of 30.
A G.m.t. of what?
30 minutes.
How many hours? I've got the 20 minutes; how many hours?
00 30 00.
00:30.
Roger. Go BFT on - BEF, rather, on Experiment 2 and 3.
Okay. On MSC-2 and -3, G.m.t. is 00 30 00. We'll be BEF at that time.
That's affirm - you still looking at that thing up there?
No, I've lost it. It had big arms sticking out of it, it looked like. I only had it for just a minute. I got a couple of pictures with a movie camera and one with the Hasselblad; but I was in free drift, and before I could get the control back I drifted and lost it.
Good show.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Would you turn your computer on for a 21-4 update?
Gemini 4, CSQ. Be advised that this pass is live on the TV networks back home.
Could you give me your quantity read on?
I have got your 21-4 backup guidance quantities. Are you prepared to copy7
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
Gemini, CSQ, do you copy?
CSQ, Gemini 4. I read you.
Roger.
Are you, - what's your status for 33-1?
We're good.
Okay. We're GO on the ground. I've got your 21-4 load prepared to transmit. Am transmitting now.
Roger.
Roger. Your load is in. I've got your 21-4 backup guidance quantity. Are you prepared to copy?
Go ahead. I'm ready.
Roger. 21-4 Your ΔV will be split between forward and aft. 56 feet forward at 1 minute 32 seconds. 120 ft/sec aft at 2+30. 01 days, 23 hours, 53 minutes, 23 seconds. 2+42. 8+46.
Roger. 21-4 56. 1+32. 120. 2+30.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
I'm getting the ... out ... and I'm pointing toward the south and somewhat more towards the rear than toward the sun.
See any clouds up there to take pictures of?
...
I guess I'll turn the computer off.
... go back to ACME.
Yes, what did you say?
...
Oh, okay.
I'm going to try to check the tape. Okay. I'm going down to ACME.
... clouds. They look like stratus, but they certainly have a moderate effect to it. I wonder if all this weather is going to be in the Hawaiian land area?
It looks like there are several layers to it. A very high cirrus layer ... a little less cirrus ... take some pictures of a series of clouds. It looks like we've got a high cirrus layer with fair weather cumulus below it.
I read it when you are ready to copy.
Roger. I have 3 53 23. Is that it?
That is negative. It is 23 58 23.
Roger, 23 58 23.
Roger.
Thank you.
Also, S-5 Experiment. MCC requests crew take terrain photos of any clear areas along the ground track and not wait until last day. Crew should identify which areas they are. Did you copy?
Roger. Understand they want us to take areas of terrain wherever it is visible, and not to wait until the last day. Be advised we would like to save some film, though, until we get the opportunity to make a pass across the Southwestern United States tomorrow, and take a bunch of sequence photos along there, if it is okay.
Roger. That's fine with us. Roger. That's fine with us. Go ahead.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go.
Can you give us your battery read-out if you did not give it to CSQ?
Roger. We didn't give them to CSQ. We'll give them to you in just a minute.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Hawaii.
Taking some pictures of clouds at 22:39 ... down here right - right now ...
You know, we ought to count up our film ...
You've got the Hasselblad over ...
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Go ahead, Guaymas. Gemini 4.
Roger. You look good from the ground. Would you turn off your Quantity Read Switch?
It's off.
Roger. I'm standing by for battery read-outs.
Roger, Gemini 4. You ready to copy?
Go ahead.
Roger. The adapter batteries are all reading 2 on the amps and 24 volts. The RCS rings are holding up well. The Secondary O<sub>2</sub> bottles are holding up well. The main batteries are reading 9 and about 22.5 to 23 volts. The control bus is (illegible), S2 at 26, S2 is 26, and the main is 23.5.
Roger. You might look for a tropical storm over the west coast of Mexico. You should be right on top of it about 22:43 Zulu, which is right about now.
Understand. We'll be looking. We're over some pretty good weather right now ...
Just took a frame of some thunderstorm buildups ...
Okay, I guess we can ...
You know, it's not too light in here right now, is it?
No. it isn't ...
Smile! You're on Candid Camera.
...
Yes, it takes about 4 inches. No, wait a minute, I don't feel it moving.
I think I know why.
Did you have it on?
Didn't have the other thing on.
Oh, no. I know why! ... isn't enough to make that thing run.
No, I didn't have the auxiliary switch on. I'll feel it run. It's running.
...
...
...
Okay. I just took a picture of two thunderstorms that look like big pancakes, with a lot of cirrus running out around to the side of them, but different tops.
You're ... take a picture just looking out the window.
... picture.
... over here, Ed?
Yes.
I have got a good view of the line ...
Yes, but you're not going to get anything ...
What?
... the ...
Yes, I know it. That's what I want.
Let me know. Got it on?
Yes, it's on.
Okay. What I want to do, Jim, is get out these other lenses. I think we can take some excellent movies with four lenses.
Hold the sextant box?
Is that where the sextant is?
The sextant's between my legs.
It's catching on the top, too.
... get it, Ed. Just don't break it.
We really want to use it on the telephoto shots.
Yes. Where is the data book?
Why don't you go back to sleep?
No, I'm all fired up now ...
Start over on that, Jim.
...
...
Magazine here is 619.
We're on RECORD now.
... the stars.
I'm coming down on the horizon now, and you can certainly see the definite two layers to the air glow, the one that is quite thick at the top, and you can see the stars as they drop through it.
You mean the one that's dim?
Yes. Yes, and as the stars drop through it, they occult a little bit; then they pop out on the left-hand part and you can actually see them go out all the way out as they hit the true horizon down at the bottom. It looks like to me - what would you estimate if you took the included angle. I would include that angle at about 7 or 8° say, from here.
...
I estimated it higher before.
The dense layer at the top is about a third ...
Yes, I'd estimated it about a third or sixth.
I used the green filter on the sextant, and the green filter does make a clearer and more defined horizon than no filter at all. Would you like to take a look at the sextant?
Yes ... horizon.
You've got a good one now, don't you?
I'm unwinding it out ... the umbilical right now. Here it comes.
Okay. There it comes.
Sure is easy to move things around, isn't it? That 8-pound sextant, you just handle it like it weighs an ounce.
...
Try the green filter. See if you don't feel it makes a more defined horizon.
Now we've got what I would consider darn near perfect star-seeing conditions with the moon effect as small as it is. As we were saying before, the magnitude of the stars - it looks like we can go right down to seventh order or maybe just a hair below, using our calibration, the Corona Australis. I have a little flash right out in front of me out there.
Yes.
...
You saw all kinds of what?
Yes. Oh.
...
Jim, I'm going to take a check on the tape recorder. I don't trust it since the bulb didn't work on it the last time. Will the lights bother you?
It looks like the tape's still running through and I haven't gotten the red light yet. That is sure unsatisfactory - the location of the tape recorder light. The whole tape recorder - that's right, the whole tape recorder operation is wrong. It ought to be something you can have on in continuous so that you can talk over the radios, also. Particularly on launch - you end up not getting any of that on tape.
Okay. I just started my ...
...
Is that right?
...
...
I'm going to go ahead and time a star coming up through it.
Okay.
See how long it takes.
Right now it's entering the dim part.
And, out it comes.
It took 49 1/2 seconds to come up through. Let's see if I can duplicate that. Get another measurement.
...
A degree and a half. Boy, that sure is deceiving.
Okay. Now I've got a good star. I started it early. You know: down below the air glow it kind of peters out to just about nothing, where the stars start coming out, and then they start moving into the air glow. I see a star very clearly and now it's starting to come into the air glow.
On that first measurement I made I really didn't - I think the air glow starts down below - a little bit below, where, looking at it from here, it looks like it really starts.
Oh! Did you see that flash? Huh? Yes. A very bright flash right on the air glow. It was on your side. A very bright flash and went out.
No, I didn't see it. Is the recorder on now?
Yes.
2°, 25 minutes.
How many, Jim?
2°, 25 minutes.
Okay.
Shucks! Now keep a bright eye out your window, because the area I saw is in your window now - where I saw the flash. It was right at the top of the air glow.
Boy, are the stars good now!
It sure looks funny right down below us ...
Yes.
The lights of the city and then on the horizon out there are the blinking lights ... upside down ... side-up.
There! See it again? Out your side?
You're not kidding. That was on the earth.
It was shooting down toward the - that one was much lower.
Oh, it's shooting down into the earth.
Yes.
Wonder what that was?
Maybe it was a falling star.
I don't know.
... wearing that big bulky suit to protect you from those falling stars.
Yes, I checked my suit very closely, and I saw no meteorite holes, much to my delight.
Okay. I tracked a bright star, and I believe that's out there in Aquila. In fact, I'm quite sure. I can see the two target stars. I've tracked it all the way up. It's almost to the top. It's going to go out of my view right now. I had him all the way from the bottom, and it took 3 minutes 23 seconds to come all the way up. That was tracking a big star like Altair.
...
No. No. Come right up from the bottom of the horizon, up through the air glow layer. From the first time, I saw it till it reached what I consider the top of the air glow layer, it took 3 minutes and 23 seconds.
Long time, isn't it?
Much longer than I thought, and it started way down ... That's why I was looking for a bright one like that.
Yes. Look out and see if you don't see Altair out your side. See Aquila, the two ... stars?
Drifted down to the bottom of your window, if you see it at all.
It may never come up to your view.
Corona Australis came up.
What? I know. I tried to make a measurement that way. Sure doesn't work very well, does it?
Yes, it just doesn't work when the world is upside down.
I think we are about to have a sunrise.
...
...
Okay.
...
Yes ... burning up ... and what I saw went right into the air glow. There goes another one! See it?
... is deceptive as far as the altitude ...
... the fireflies ...
I think the ... the red light ... ought to change it.
What?
...
No. I was going to catch it as it came out so I could catch the strange effect of one side in sunlight and the other side in night. I'm going to start turning it on now at 19 and see what I get. Should be pretty dark ...
You're in the daylight over there, aren't you?
... right kind of film.
Okay, we're starting Film Tape Pack no. 11. We Just finished with no. 9. It looked like the light came on that pack. We'd better check to see if no. 8 has some way of turning the light on. It might be the film tape magazine that causes the light not to come on.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Turn your computer ON for a 33-1 retro load.
At this time, I'm switching the medical recorder from 1 OFF to 1 ON and 2 OFF. Jim's to go to bed.
Gemini 4, CSQ transmitting 33-1 load.
Roger. We got the update light.
...
You're not kidding.
Let me know when you want to do the ...
I'll get it. Don't be over confident now.
Okay.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Houston would like to know what your relative bearing was when you sighted the satellite.
Roger. Stand by one, please. Do you have a relative bearing for them?
Yes, I'm pulling it, but I'm not getting anything. Just the same way as it was when you were doing it for me.
Is this valve screwed up here in any way?
Yes, I'm pulling.
Roger, CSQ ... and the satellite was up near the sun. My small end started drifting up on us, drifting slightly. And I saw the thing over the small end which I think was pointed toward the east.
... I saw it over the small end, which I think was pointed toward the east.
Gemini 4, CSQ. You were not up on the first part of your transmission. I got, "Saw it over small end and you believe were pointed east." What was the first part of your transmission?
Roger. My small end was up above the horizon so I couldn't see the horizon. As it came around toward the sun I saw the - this other satellite, but then as the sun came in through the window I lost it because the sun was so bright.
Roger. You were looking into the sun then, when you saw it?
That's affirmative.
Okay. Pull harder.
Okay. I got your 33-1 load up. I've got your 33-1 backup guidance quantities when you're prepared to copy. We had a little problem last pass. We had a complete power failure about two-thirds the way through the pass.
Give it a big tug?
I'm pulling, Jim. I'm pulling, Jim.
It's the same thing that happened to me ...
I'm not being too successful.
I wasn't either.
I'm getting it all over me as a matter of fact.
Pull on it some more.
I'm afraid I'm going to ...
Okay.
... collapse the bellows.
Gemini 4, CSQ. You can turn your computer OFF.
Roger. Computer is going OFF.
Okay. Try pulling now.
Okay, all the way out.
I haven't got any left. You're going to have to dump it. End up doing the same thing I did.
Yes. Shoot! I got it all over. Maybe we're getting it on there too tight, Ed. You know that old - oh, boy! ...
Are you prepared to copy your 33-1 data?
Stand by one, please.
Roger.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. 33-1 39 forward at 1+04. 120 aft at 2+30. GMTRC 02 days 17 42 47. 2+30. 8+39.
Roger. Understand 33-1 39 forward at 1+04. 120 aft at 2+30. 02 17 42 47. 2+30. 8+39.
Affirmative.
Everything looks very good here on the ground. We are standing by.
Roger. We're in good shape up. We got a good ...
Gemini 4, CSQ. You are fading away.
I'm taking some general - normal lens on the 16-mm photographs of the water and the clouds at the present time. We've been having a lot of trouble with the ON/OFF button on this camera. It goes only about every third or fourth actuation. This might explain some of the reason why Jim didn't get as much film on that first - in our EVA work.
For analyzing these films - we're taking them at 00:04. We're taking them of the ocean and the cloud background. They look like they have fair the weather cumulus with the characteristic cirrus above. I'm taking quite a lot of them on the flight.
I'm taking the S-6 photographs on the second pass through the Pacific cloud area. We're taking the first picture now.
We're starting with Frame no. 35, Film Pack no. 7. Using the same old setting - 250 at 11 ...
I'm also taking some pictures with the 16-mm camera of the same area, with the normal lens.
Feels like the shutter is sticking on at the Hasselblad at the present time on some of these pictures. This is the second series of the S-6 pictures over the Atlantic. The film-advance mechanism is definitely causing erratic operation of the Hasselblad. I'll be operating it manually from here on.
This next one I'll be shooting into the sun, and I do have a reflection on the window. Let's see how it comes out. It'll be shot no. 43 on the Film Pack 7.
I'm in a very good blunt-end position now for MSC-2 and -3 run through the South Atlantic anomaly. I'm shooting right into the sun now ... 500 and f/6.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is RKV CAP COM.
RKV, this Gemini 4.
Roger. We were expecting an Aero-Med Type 1 pass. Would you insert the oral temperature probe on the Pilot?
... Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, negative on the oral temperature. Negative on the oral temperature. Go ahead on the blood pressure.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV SIR JOHN. We are not receiving your blood pressure. Over.
Roger, it's coming up.
The cuff is full-scale.
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. We have a good blood pressure. Give me a mark on your exerciser.
... coming on at this time. That at 00:30 ...
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV SIR JOHN. Are you completing your exercises?
Stand by one, please, RKV.
Standing by.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
RKV, Gemini 4, ...
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM. Discontinue the Aero-Med Pass.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM. Do you copy?
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM. Do you read?
Gemini 4, RKV. I read you very weak. T/M is broken. Discontinue the Aero-Med Pass.
Roger, I have ... my exercising and I have hooked up the blood pressure cuff ...
Negative, we have lost T/M contact.
Gemini 4, can you read me?
Gemini 4, this is RKV. Do you read me?
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
CSQ, this is Gemini 4.
Roger. Copying you loud and clear ... your foot on the ground. Be advised to go to a heads-up position, heads-up attitude for a test critical tape dump over Hawaii that's in about 5 or 6 minutes.
Roger. Understand. Heads-up for the Hawaii pass in about 5 or 6 minutes.
Roger. Also, over Hawaii the air-to-ground communications will be carried live on television.
Roger. Understand.
Gemini 4, CSQ. We have nothing else; be standing by.
Roger, CSQ. Thank you very much. Everything's GO up here.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Go ahead.
You might ask the ... Houston if they would like to have a pick-up ... I've been taking a few exercises to keep ...
Okay, read you with background noise. Understand that you want to inquire of Houston if they want a Type 1 Medical Pass on the Command Pilot.
... see if they want to make up for one they missed a while back.
Roger. Gemini 4, Houston will advise you over Hawaii.
Roger, understand.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Would you verify that the ECS O<sub>2</sub> heater switch is OFF?
Roger, that's affirmative. The ECS O<sub>2</sub> heater switch is OFF and has been OFF.
Gemini 4, HAW CAP COM.
Go ahead, Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Roger. You are looking good on the ground.
I would like to advise you to perform the Medical Type 1 Pass on Pilot over RKV.
Roger. Understand a Type 1 Medical Pass on Pilot over RKV.
Roger. RKV acquisition in approximately 10 minutes.
Roger. Acquisition in approximately 10 minutes.
I have also a map update for you. Are you ready to copy?
Standing by for map update.
Rev. 22 01 07 00. Longitude 63° East.
Roger. Understand. Rev. 22 01 07 00. Longitude 63° East.
... 63° East.
That's affirmative. 63° East.
Roger.
Also, I would like to congratulate the new American space flight record. Congratulations!
Roger. We have quite a few more to go.
Roger.
Thank you very much.
Gemini, Hawaii.
Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Roger, on the acquisition. The time of the RKV - it'll be approximately 20 minutes.
Roger. It'll be 20 minutes to the RKV acquisition.
Roger.
Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Hawaii. Go ahead.
Roger. Be advised I have a good view of the Hawaiian Islands now out my window. I'm passing over them in about 30 seconds. Scattered to broken clouds and looks pretty good. In fact, right now it looks like I'm looking down if I'm right, right down on the island of Hilo.
Roger, Gemini 4.
It looks pretty good.
Gemini 4. Gemini 4. RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4. Gemini 4. RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead, RKV. Gemini 4.
Roger. We have a good temp on you, and we're standing by for your blood pressure.
Roger. Coming up.
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. You're full-scale.
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. We have a good blood pressure. Standing by for your mark.
Roger. MARK now.
... completed. Starting up.
Roger.
Gemini 4. You're full-scale.
Gemini 4. RKV Surgeon. We have a good blood pressure. Standing by for your food, water, and sleep.
Roger. On my last sleep period, I got four hours rest, most of which was good sound sleep. My last meal was the peanut cubes, orange juice, sandwiches, and fruit cocktail which was all ... I took about six swallows of water with that meal, and I'm preparing at the present time to have a snack of peaches and fruitcake.
Roger. Understand all of Meal D and you're going into your peaches and fruitcake.
That's affirmative.
The Command Pilot's asleep over here. He's got all the food in his ... box.
Roger. RKV Surgeon over to CAP COM.
Roger.
Roger. This is RKV CAP COM. You're going to have a critical dump over the CSQ.
Roger. This is RKV CAP COM. You're going to have a critical dump over the CSQ. Request that you be in attitude for that.
Roger. Have you been not receiving some of our dumps?
Negative. All of your dumps have been very good.
Roger. Rather than power-up and go to heads-up attitude, we'd just as soon continue in the manner in which we have. I went to the powered-up configuration and heads-up over Hawaii for that dump. I would prefer to remain in a free-drift mode at this time.
Roger. Flight says that's okay.
Roger. Thank you.
Okay. We'd also like to get a Primary O<sub>2</sub> read. Would you cycle it ON, please?
Roger. Coming ON.
When was the last time that you had Primary O<sub>2</sub> read?
It was probably while I was asleep.
Roger.
There's no need to get it too accurately.
Roger. I have turned it OFF. Do you want me to put it back ON?
How long did you have it cycled ON?
Roger ... had it ON for 10 seconds.
Roger. I think we have it.
Roger.
What are you reading onboard?
Stand by one.
Roger.
My onboard reading is 34 percent, and I'm holding right at 940 psi.
Roger. That concurs with our readings on the ground.
Roger.
Roger. All systems look good here from the ground.
..., we're pulling in the neighborhood of about 13 to 14 amps.
Roger. I understand in the neighborhood of 13 to 14 amps.
Roger. We've turned everything off that ... there's just one small light on.
Flight advises that they need the tape dump over the CSQ, so please go into proper attitude. That will be at a G.m.t. of 03 hours 03 minutes. Do you copy?
Roger. 03:03, and we'll be in a tape dump attitude.
Roger. We're coming up on LOS.
Roger.
Hey, Jim, babe. Are you sleeping?
What?
Did you go to sleep?
...
I didn't think you were. I let you overshoot 15 minutes worth. I was doing D-8, and there wasn't any reason for you to wake up.
Do you think we're sleeping too much? All we do is sleep.
I think it's an eat period for myself, but I think we should both eat ... here.
In fact, I got so hungry while you were asleep that I didn't ... food on either snack.
Yes, as a matter of fact ...
The matter of another meal.
We got congratulations over Hawaii! Did you hear it?
We passed the United States space record. And we have got a very important tape dump at 03:03. I think it was over CSQ, and they wanted ... up for it. I asked them - I said, "Are you getting all of our timed taped dump?" They said, "Perfectly." I said, "Why can't we just remain in drifting flight, powered down?" They said, "Stand by."
They came back and said that's what they wanted, so I said, "okay."
MSC-1 is OFF now. MSC-2 and -3 - I just turned those OFF. I'm going to switch Biomedical recorders. I think after this, we'll go ahead and let them run.
Listen, let's leave yours ...
Okay.
You've been running yours like mad, and I haven't been running mine at all.
Okay. Here we go. Switched back.
... 100 hours on yours ...
We can't get a 100 hours on them, Jim.
...
Mine has been OFF now for about 8 hours.
Yes, 4 hours this time and 4 hours last time.
...
You'll be asleep, too?
...
Why don't we? I don't feel like sleeping again.
...
Well, we haven't been. It's been holding right at 940.  I think it's up to 950 now.
Okay, I'm going to ...
...
Right.
...
03:03 ...
... had a very important dump at Hawaii.
What is so important about these dumps?
...
...
You did? I just checked them a little while ago. Everything's holding up.
...
No. It's down to a little under 2. It's just about 2.
...
Yes, they're down to 5 now ... we've been running on one fan how for a long time. Day 2 ... We are behind on our food ...
Right. I just finished it.
...
... sunrise.
... That thing really grabs me when it goes like that.
...
Have you got a good view of it out there?
...
... get to sleep ...
We sure (illegible)
...
Yes.
Ah, ... cereal.
Took the combination of S-5 and S-6 shots as we came up over the Himalayan Mountains.
That was no. 48, Magazine no. 7, at 02 53.
Took an S-6 weather picture when we were in the vicinity of the tropical storm Carla. Frame 49 on Magazine 7. The time -
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
CSQ, Gemini 4.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. I have a CLA and PLA update for you when you're prepared to copy.
Also, Houston would like to know - have you completed your Delta-8 Experiment?
Roger. We've completed the D-8 Experiment. We're ready to copy.
Roger. Also be advised to leave both the Biomed recorders on for the reminder of the mission.
Roger. We've used them a little on the sequence. I think we'll leave no. 2 off for another 30 minutes.
Okay.
Okay. I believe you've got Area 25-3. Is that affirmative?
Say again.
I say, I believe you have Area 25-3.
Negative. We do not.
Okay. All the days will be the second day. I'll just give you the GMTRC times. Area 25-3: GMTRC 05 51 18. 8+14. 16+55. Area 26-DELTA: ΔV 86. 1+49. 06 51 37. 08+47. 13+03.

Roger. What was the reverse bank on that? The 400 K on the last one?
Okay. The last 4 - the last 5, the CLA's do not have reverse bank times at this time.
Roger. Are you ready for readback?
Stand by.

Did you copy?
Gemini, CSQ. Do you copy?
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
I just took pictures ... Frame 51 ...
I just took Frame 52 on the Hasselblad Film Pack no. 7 ... high deck of clouds ... very sharp break ... The break is ...
I've taken two pictures on the S-6, and I believe they are right along the inter-tropical convergence zone. There is a nice band of heavy cloud build-ups ... in a line approximately in line with the equator.
Golly, ... really is ... out there ...
I guess I'd better not.
Oh! I'm just about dry ...
...
Yes.
Maybe they're down there computing very carefully whether we can go for the extra ... hours.
...
Go after that extra ... teen hours.
...
You know, go after the 5-day -
Oh, no! Ha! Ha!
We got an extra load of food onboard.
... we have fuel enough?
How much OAMS we got? 70 - 60?
No, 70 ...
We've got one more than we're supposed to have.
...
... dirty rascal ... !
We're supposed to have four per day for each guy.
...
... double bags.
... meal ... bags ...
You know better than that. Ha! Ha! You're just being unbearable. Ha, ha, ha!
...
Kind of reminds me of a T-bird. Ha, ha!
...
Kind of reminds me of a T-bird, you know. Here I am ...
...
We ought to try to see if we can see our water tank.
Hey, here's our box.
Right here ...
...
Did you put a question mark by ... retros, ... ?
I did, too.
Okay. Now, right now, ... daylight ... sure daylight.
Well, we're getting in dark. I can see dark here too, Jim. Let's see on one of these nights or days see what we can and can't see.
These cinnamon toasts are all right.
... All right before. I don't think so -
I don't think so.
No, ... plain toast ... These are coated with something.
...
Yes. Pretty good. It's all a function of how it's been ...
... toast is all squashed ...
...
Yes. I didn't ...
Pretty good, Jim. Try one.
Those are good.
Yes, very good.
...
...
Going to an extra exercise period - the second exercise period I've had that wasn't an official part of the flight.
Okay. I did it for a count of 60.
Maybe I can ...
...
...
Well, I started out with 5 pencils and I've got 3 left so -
I started out with 2 and have 1 left. I mean, I started out with 2 and I've got 2.
Oh, yes. I put it there.
That's an opportunist ...
Yes.
Well, let me see. I don't know whether to put my gloves on or not. How's everything look over there? Not bad, huh? I believe I'll try it without them. Let me see. Where's the visor? I think you handed it over to me, didn't you? I'm looking right at the Southern Cross. Very pretty.
I think I did, Ed.
I think you did, too.
Do you want the movie camera?
Yes.
Do you want the "Y" connector? Now, I took this off the Hasselblad. It was fouling the pictures up.
What was?
This was.
...
Oh, the shutter wasn't dropping right. It was dropping delayed, remember?
...
No. Not that way, though. I had this pushed all the way down in. It was getting in there and sticking in there like this. So there's the "Y" connector if you want it.
...
I've got a normal lens on it.
We're running out of what?
Hasselblad pictures.
Still not more than we had bargained for?
Sure wish I knew how our water supply was doing back there.
I do too.
...
...
I don't think so. Do you?
...
...
Why don't you see if you can see, Jim.
That's really neat!
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Maybe you can direct it better.
...
...
No way of telling, huh?
I think the lens cover's got a couple of fingermarks on it.
Hey, I never did find the sleeve cover.
I'm pretty sure ...
I think you did, too. I've always left it right there before, though ...
Turn that big spotlight off.
...
You really ought to be able to ...
You see it over here toward me?
Yes, that we can be assured of.
...
How about under me? See it under me anywhere?
I can reach in under there. That's the first place. I looked.
... not on your suit.
That exercise eats you up in this bunny suit. I'm not going to do that anymore.
...
What do you mean?
What did you do, bleed all over the seat ... ?
I don't know.
...
I'll bet it is. What do you mean, Jim?
Oh, you know that big ... on my desk?
Oh, yes.
No, I'd say we're (illegible)
I feel like I'm up to my ... for survival in the Arctics ... in the tropics ...
Ha! Ha!
I feel like one of the ... you know?
... about 30 or 20 minutes ...
...
...
No. Not unless we do something about the hatch.
... being able to stand up and then going outside through the hatch opening.
That's right.
... it didn't look as strange from outside as it did from inside, from ...
Yes.
I reached over here one time ... a picture of where I thought you were.
Oh, really?
I don't know whether I got it.
Well, that lanyard - the shape of the spacecraft - it just kept me up here all the time. I'd go out here and tether dynamics would bring me back up in here. And then I'd operate back this way. We didn't think of that when we designed that anchor point on there.
All of our preflight plan worked out. Didn't it?
What do you mean?
... Ha! Ha!
...
You have daylight out in front.
But go get over on your side. But my first whole maneuver was done over on this side. Did you see me the first time I went up?
I couldn't.
Did you see me - Was I out in front of you one time?
Yes.
Was that when I was yawing right - left a little bit?
Yes.
Shortly thereafter was when I ran out of fuel, wasn't it?
Yes. It didn't last very long. It really went in a hurry.
Where did I use up all of my time?
I don't know. Your time or your fuel?
I was out there that long too, wasn't I?
...
I heard him. I heard him when we finally went off VOX - "GET HIM IN!" Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Did you hear him?
Yes. I said, "Have you got any instructions for us?" "YEAH, GET IN!"
Ha! Ha! Ha! Who was it? Was that Gus? I thought it was Chris.
I think at that time I was standing on top of the spacecraft. No, I wasn't. I was out there. That was when I saw Cuba, wasn't it?
Hey, Ed!
I'm trying.
That ... cool it down.
I've got to sit down and tape more on that tape than I have ...
Have to get my ... and get a good ... on getting out of the spacecraft. What we need is a big spacecraft with a big inward opening hatch - just like they have on a submarine.
Port opening?
Yes, so that the pressure inside seals the hatch.
...
No. You have to have a ...
This is pretty ...
Right here?
Yes.
...
I think we've got to do something better. They've been trying all types of things -
Look at that thunder and lightning storm.
...
Yes.
I wonder where we are, Jim?
...
Let me just check these and then I'll go to sleep.
... to get tired of it.
Okay.
...
You're right. I hate to go to sleep.
Let's just check what time those are and then we can find out where we were later.
...
Okay.
...
Saw a great many thunderstorms down below us. It looks like we're going approximately small-end-forward and we're upside down. Very, very heavy thunder and lightning activity. And the time is - what was that time, Jim?
10 ti11 4.
10 till 4?
Right.
And I'm going to sleep. We're going blunt-end-forward because the stars are setting.
We're presently over the Arabian Peninsula at 04:13.
Taking pictures of some of the sand dunes down here.
...
... the recorder ...
Okay.
That last picture I took was ... time.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. RKV CAP COM.
Roger RKV, Gemini 4. Go ahead.
Roger. We have your oral temp. Pump up your blood pressure, please.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead, RKV CAP COM.
Roger. Would you give us the blood pressure please?
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. Would you pump it up a little more, please?
I'll give you full-scale when you're there.
RKV Surgeon. Try it there.
Gemini 4, this is RKV Surgeon. You're getting a phased run-down on your blood pressure. Would you check your setting to be sure it's in?
Roger Gemini 4, this is RKV Surgeon. You are still not getting a good blood pressure but before you try it next time would you check your fitting end be sure you don't have some loose trash or something inside the O-ring.
This is Gemini 4... the blood pressure.
Roger. We got - we're getting good blood pressures from Ed, so keep trying it for a while. Could you go ahead and get your water and sleep report now, though.
Okay ... last four hour period ... I got about an hours worth of sleep ...
Roger. Did you say Meal D of the first day and Meal A of the second day?
The second day ... Meal A of the second.
RKV Surgeon. Roger. CAP COM has something for you.
Roger. Have you checked your wet and dry bulb temperatures as of yet?
Gemini 4, RKV.
Go ahead, RKV.
Roger. Have you taken your wet and dry bulb temperature readings?
Roger. We've been taking them right along.
Roger. Could you give me a read out?
Stand by one.
Dry bulb between about 72 and 79. A little bit before that they ran between 75 and 77. Wet bulb last group was between 57 and 61. Preceding group between 60 and 65. Let me get you a relative humidity here.
It's approximately 05:25, passing over South America. Whole series of thunderstorms down there that are bright enough to be actually shining up into the spacecraft. Very, very violent.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Roger, Gemini 4. Reading you loud and clear. Did you get your map update for revolution 25?
Roger. It was 3° West and 05:36.
Roger, 5 west 05:33. Did you get the S-6 experiment update?
Negative. What did you have to say about that?
Okay. Typhoon Babe is still off Formosa. You will be over it at 06:06. Weather advises there's a new storm area that you will be over at 06:13 G.m.t. We'd like some pictures if you can get them. No fuel usage. Did you copy that?
Gemini 4, this is Houston. Did you copy the S-6?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is Houston. I will give you a 27-BRAVO update if you can read. It is a split burn. Forward 76. Aft 94. 2+07. 1+58. 09 12 06. 9+30. Did you copy? Over.
Negative. Say it again please.
Roger. Area 27-BRAVO Split burn. Forward 76. Aft 94. 2+07. 1+58. 09 12 06. 9+30. Over.
Roger. Could you give us back your last dry and wet bulb temperature on your humidity check?
Roger. They were about 75 and 77, but our humidity was around 60 percent.
Roger. Copied that. If you can, get your left and right cabin wall temperatures using the thermostat. Also, report on visible moisture, if any, and is your blotting paper wet to the touch? Over.
Roger. The - I took the wall temperature quite some time ago in the left-hand food box and it was 75. The blotting paper is not wet to the touch, and there is no visible moisture.
Understand no moisture and not wet to the touch. Could you give me an estimate on the completion of your experiments D-9, S-6, and S-5, or roughly how much you've done on that?
We haven't been able to do anything with D-9 that was when we could record any data. We are going to... We ... For S-6 we need one long pass over the United States to take a series of 35 pictures across the southwestern United States. ... to point the spacecraft down at the ground while we take a string of pictures.
Understand you need one more pass on S-5 and you have a fair amount of S-6. Is that affirmative?
We have a fair amount of S-6. We've had some scattered S-5 sightings ... pictures, but we need one run over the United States at least, and we'd like another one over the - over North Africa if we can work it in.
Understand. I copied that. For your target of opportunity on these experiments, we'd like to give them a priority of no. 1, S-5; no. 2, S-6; and no. 3, D-9, if possible.
Roger, it's going to be pretty tough to get a D-9 without any fuel.
That's affirmative. D-9 without any fuel.
Gemini 4, that's all from Houston. We'll be standing by. We have about 1 minute to LOS.
Arabian Peninsula ...
I just shot frames 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 over North Africa. ... (illegible) Frames (illegible) ... 6 ... Arabian Peninsula, taken out of the ... right through the middle of the Peninsula, looking out towards one of the ... there.

Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
RKV, Gemini 4.
Roger. Are you reading?
I read you loud and clear, RKV. How me?
Roger, you're coming in real good. We have an Apollo landmark for you. Are you prepared to copy?
All I received was are we prepared to copy. Are we prepared to copy what?
Roger, it's an Apollo landmark.
Stand by a second.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger, it's Cairo in the 26th rev. G.m.t. 07 18 37. 12 miles northwest, that is northwest of the track. Slant range 90 nautical miles.
Gemini 4, do you copy?
Roger, Cairo on the 26th rev. G.m.t. 07 18 37. 12 nautical miles northwest of track. 90 miles slant range.
That's affirmative. Our Surgeon would like to talk to you.
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon.
Roger, RKV Surgeon. Go ahead.
Roger, I have a couple of questions for you. First, about the blood pressure. I don't want to bug you very much on it, but did you change the O-ring?
No I didn't. I looked at the O-ring and I don't think it's the O-ring. I think it's my ... I noticed when I got checked out the other morning just before launch, that they had a little trouble with it then. I ... the blood pressure moves. It looks like a problem with my suit. Would you like for me to try to give you another one?
Negative, there's no reason to do that right now. I have some more questions for you. If you aren't doing anything towards the end of the pass, we could try it.
Okay.
First, a couple of questions on your general condition. How restful do you think your sleep is?
Well, it's not very restful. This radio feeds through into the other helmet, he can hear it, not very loud, he's got his ... but he can hear all the radio transmissions and ... it keeps waking you up.
Roger, do you feel like you are dry or dehydrated?
No, possibly I did notice, oh, at the end of about the 6th or 7th pass, I drank quite a bit of water ... And got to feeling better. I've been eating and drinking right along now so I don't feel dehydrated at all.
Roger, your voice sounds a little dry to us down here and you do think you are getting enough water to drink now?
Yes sir, I think I'm being dried out by the oxygen. My nose did bleed ... after launch.
Roger. Jim, go ahead and keep pumping the water down because we have plenty aboard.
Well, I hate to run out, you know, after only 3 days.
Roger, White is drinking a good bit. I'm just about to start on my meal B of the second day, and Ed's sleeping now and when he gets up, he's going to eat his.
Roger, if you have some time now you may give me a blood pressure.
Okay.
You are full-scale - Beautiful! - That's a beautiful record, Jim.
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. That's a good record. We have a good blood pressure on you.
Okay, very good. I think I give you a good one every third or fourth time.
Good average.
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. We have nothing else. We'll stand by for your comments if you have any.
Roger. I think I'll ... I imagine we're powering ... at the end of 4 days, besides from that we're in pretty good shape right now.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
... , this is Gemini 4.
Roger, Gemini 4, I'd like to explain this split-burn to you. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, anytime your OAMS burn is greater than 120 ft/sec, we will give you a split-burn, 84 feet out of the forward thrusters and the balance out of the aft thrusters. Do you understand? Over.
Okay, anytime OAMS is greater than 120 ft/sec, I am going to get 84 - 84 out of the forward and the rest out of the aft.
Roger, you got it, Jim. We will be standing by at all of these remote sites. I'll just give you a call and say, "Standing by" and if you get lonesome and you have any comments, you can come on up, and we have a few personal messages here from the doctor. Over.
Okay.
Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon. I have a message for the Command Pilot. Little League score: the Hawks, 3; the Pelicans, 2; and Mike 1.
Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon. Do you read?
I sure do.
Did you copy the score for the Hawk-Pelican game?
Boy, did I ever!
Roger, a message for the Pilot. The Dodgers 11, the Yankees 10, and Eddie had 1 for 3.
Okay, he's sleeping right now, but I'll tell him when he wakes up.
Roger, you can also advise him that his wife received the flowers and she forgot to tell him that today when she was on air-to-ground.
Okay.
Houston Surgeon out.
Jim, this is CAP COM. You also might tell the Pilot when he wakes up that Jim's here, and he's going to give him one more chance to change seats with him.
Ha!
Hey, Jim, this is Shakey, the Assistant Surgeon. How's the waste management coming along?
... I want to know whose heart rate was the highest the other day.
Hey, James. This is Shakey, the Assistant Surgeon. How's the waste management coming along?
Hey, listen, the only free water we've got in here is every time we've tried to use that urine system.
Now have fun, Gemini 4, and as I say, anytime you get lonesome we'll be standing by at a remote site.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. The Astros beat the Cardinals 5-2.
Roger, what was that score - what was that score of that game that Eddie White played in?
Roger, the score in the game that Eddie White is Dodgers 11, Yankees 10, Eddie's batting was 1 for 3.
... now we'll keep quiet.
I can see a black fire down on the desert. You can see right down to the very source where it's coming from. I couldn't see exactly what it was, but it made a very, very distinct mark on the ground. I've taken several S-5 terrain pictures as we crossed the desert at 07:17. Feels like we've got a failure in magazine no. 7. It feels like one of the dogs isn't catching down on the film or the film's bailing up. I don't know. I don't believe we'll get much out of it.
Just took up through Frame 29 on the Hasselblad on a run across North Africa and Arabia. Now, I guess we're over Iran ...
What?
...
How did you get it over there?
...
Shoot! I was afraid to turn it. I was sure I was to the stop.
... found out ...
The lens is crapped out on this one ... screwed up on that one ... The sextant is screwed up. The 16-mm camera doesn't run but about half the time. I may go to sleep now.
What?
...
Taken many pictures with the camera?
Not too many. No. Maybe I ought to start concentrating on it.
I just wondered ...
No, I haven't taken very many. Have you?
I want to start working on ...
Come on! Go to sleep! Listen, you'll be awake in an hour. You'll have 5 hours or 6 hours to sit around and play with that camera. Now, put it down and go to bed!
...
Go ahead, RKV, Gemini 4.
Roger, we're expecting a Type 1 pass on you this time.
Roger, I'll hurry up ...
Okay, he's still asleep -
Don't bother to wake him. Do not bother to awaken the Pilot.
Say again.
Do not bother to awaken him for us. We'll wait off until later on.
Roger ... 20 minutes.
Do you want a ... temperature and blood pressure?
Roger, Gemini 4. Stand by a second. We'll check with the Cape and see what they want here.
Gemini 4, RKV. Negative on the Type 1 on the Command Pilot.
Did you copy?
Roger. You don't want a Type 1 test on the Command Pilot.
That's negative.
We'll stand by on this one.
Okay...
Gemini 4, Canary Islands CAP COM.
Go ahead, Canary. Gemini 4.
Roger. Stand by to copy Apollo Landmark update.
Okay. Stand by.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Roger.
Are you ready?
Just a second.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. Rev 27, Apollo Landmark 15 08 52 59. 46 miles south.
Roger. Apollo Landmark no. 15 Rev 27. 08 52 59. 46 miles south.
Roger. Your systems look good from here. Stand by. We want you to wake the Pilot up. We will run an Aero-Med Pass One on this pass.
Roger. We just got him up.
Okay. Stand by for my Surgeon on UHF.
Pilot. This is Canary Surgeon. Would you pump up your blood pressure cuff?
He just put the thermometer in his mouth and he's getting the cuff out.
Gemini 4, you need not take oral temperature. We will not have time. We will dispense with that. Proceed and pump up your blood pressure cuff.
Okay.
Canary, is this Apollo Landmark Investigation to be done with or without fuel?
Cuff is full-scale.
Gemini 4, Canary Surgeon. Do you read?
Gemini 4, Canary Surgeon.
Go ahead, Canary Surgeon. Gemini 4.
Your blood pressure was received. Begin exercise on your mark.
Gemini 4, Canary Surgeon.
MARK.
Did you get my mark?
Check. We received your mark.
Okay.
We're sending the blood pressure now.
Gemini 4, Canary Surgeon. Your cuff is full. Have you completed your exercise?
Roger.
Gemini 4, Canary Surgeon. Your blood pressure has been received. May I have your food, water, and rest status?
Roger, Gemini 4. I just got up from a long ... nap. I had a 4 1/2 hour nap. Out of that time, I probably had 3 1/2 hours of sleep. I've had, since I got up, 3 swallows of water. I finished my - before I went to bed I had Meal A of day 2, and I'm getting ready to eat Meal B of day 2.
Very good. I will return you to CAP COM. Canary Surgeon out.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. We're at LOS. Do you have anything more?
Roger. I'd like to know if that Apollo Landmark Investigation is going to be done without fuel.
Roger.
Flight says without fuel.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
RKV, Gemini 4.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Read you loud and clear.
Roger. I have some Apollo updates for you.
Roger. Stand by one, please.
Roger.
Okay. Go ahead with the updates.
Roger. Apollo Landmark closest approach Rev 28, no. 11: G.m.t. 10 16 51. 28 miles south, no. 12: G.m.t. 10 21 50. 6 miles south. no. 13: G.m.t. 10 25 30. 1.5 miles north. no. 18: 10 30 15. 28 miles north. No attitude control will be used for these maneuvers.
Roger, understand - no attitude control. Would you read the first one over? The first ...
Roger, the first one was on number 11 and the G.m.t. was 10 16 51. 28 miles south.
Roger, understand. I got four updates. Is that correct?
That is affirmative. Four updates.
Roger, be advised ... the Command Pilot has started the sleep cycle and I just finished ...
Roger, everything looks good from down here.
Right.
Gemini 4, we'll have LOS in about 1 minute here. Do you have anything?
Negative, Gemini 4. And be advised on the D-9 of the Apollo Landmarks. Don't have any attitude around that would permit getting very much on them.
Roger, we understand on that. That's okay.
...
Flight advises that on numbers 12 and 13 you can use fuel sparingly. Do you copy?
Roger, on numbers 12 and 13 I use fuel sparingly. Roger.
Roger. Roger.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead, Canary. Gemini 4.
Roger, your systems look green.
Roger, understand, systems green. Thank you. They look good up here.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Is your Quantity Switch in the READ position?
That's affirmative. I'll turn it off now.
Roger, it's off.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Have you powered your ACME power supply?
Affirmative.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Standing by.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
This is Gemini 4. Go ahead.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. Can you give me a little info on how your control went over North Africa, and how much pulsing did you do?
Roger, we used Pulse Control in a minimum amount; the target of number 12 was obscured by clouds; I had the time and location pretty well squared away. I could have tracked if I could have seen the target, I believe. Target number 13, it was in the clear, and I was able to pick up the city of Alexandria. The airport I think I ... but I haven't been able to put my attention on looking for the airport. I could have spotted the airport. I went ahead and operated the camera and took some pictures as I passed over it. The location of the target from the data called up was satisfactory.
Roger, what time did you turn your ACME power supply off?
Roger. I turned my ACME power supply off, I would estimate at about 35.
Roger, understand. Are you ready to copy a group of PLA, CLA, updates?
Roger, go ahead.
30-1 109. 2+19. 13 00 13. 4+52. 9+40. 31-1 84 aft will be 42. 2+20. 9+54. 14 34 22. 3+54. 9+18. 32-1 84 aft will be 56. 2+20. 1+11. 16 08 16. 3+05. 8+53. 33-1 84 aft will be 68. 2+20. 1+27. 17 42 15. 2+37. 8+49. 29-BRAVO 84. 50 aft. 2+20. 1+03. 12 16 35. 12+08. 30-BRAVO 120. 2+32. 13 50 19. 12+29. 34-4 120. 2+32. 20 29 04. 3+33. 8+55. 31-BRAVO 95. 2+01. 15 30 09. 11+48. 32-BRAVO 86. 1+50. 17 05 01. 10+40. 33-BRAVO 84. 1+47. 18 36 28. 10+01. Over.
Roger. I got them all except for one quantity 33-1 the aft DELTA V.
Aft DELTA V 68.
Roger, 68. You are getting pretty sharp calling these up.
Okay, very good. You're looking good here.
Roger, everything is great.
You don't have a new map update for me, do you?
Not at this time. You'll get one as you come along.
Roger. I'll be looking for another one.
Roger, we'll pass that on to Houston.
Rog.
... and that will be the end of the 29th rev.
Roger. Understand. Ascending node, 119°, 12 57 00. 29th Rev.
Roger. We'd like your Quantity Read Switch ON, and we'd like an onboard mass quantity readout, please.
Roger. The Quantity Switch is ON. Repeat your last request. You were coming garbled.
Roger. We'd like an onboard quantity readout, please.
Roger. An onboard quantity readout. I'm getting 30 1/2 percent.
Roger, understand. You said 30 1/2 percent. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
It's good visual acuity.
Roger. Everything's GO up here. The Command Pilot's having a pretty good sleep right now ...
Gemini 4, this is Houston. That's all we have for the present. We'll just be standing by.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Canary, Gemini 4.
Roger, Gemini 4. Read you loud and clear. You look green from here.
Roger. Everything's GO in the spacecraft. Looking good. The Command Pilot's asleep right now.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. What is your primary O<sub>2</sub> tank pressure?
Roger. Primary O<sub>2</sub> tank pressure is 950.
You say 950?
That's affirmative. Just a little under.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
All right. Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
Okay. You're looking good here on the ground. What's your status?
Roger. The status is GO up here and everything's looking good.
Roger. Have either of you used the fecal collection devices yet?
Negative, but it won't be long.
Roger. Understand.
Roger. One thing you might check on, we've had a little ... Do you want to take a reading on that?
Okay. We'll take a check here on the ground. Stand by.
Coming down at you in about 5 or 10 seconds.
Coming on now.
It's - 29 percent here on the ground.
Roger. We're reading the pressure now at 30. Thank you.
Roger.
Okay. We're just standing by here for you if you need anything.
Negative, everything's pretty good.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. Houston CAP COM. Over.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
Roger. We are receiving your oral temp. We would like your Quantity Read Switch ON throughout the States pass. Over.
This is Houston CAP COM. You can commence your blood pressure at this time, and I'm turning you over to Aero-Med. Over.
Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon. We have your oral temperature. You can send blood pressure now.
Your cuff is full-scale.
Blood pressure is ... , Gemini 4. Start exercise on your mark.
On your mark.
Blood pressure is received. Standing by for your food and water report. We have your feces report from Canaries at 09:06 Zulu.
Roger. I understand. I have completed the second meal. I've had approximately 6 swallows of water. I've also had a good use of the defecation bag, and everything is in good shape.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Put your Quantity Read Switch ON and leave it ON until I tell you. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Roger. I have some Flight Plan updates. Are you ready to copy?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Are you ready to copy Flight Plan updates? Over.
Wait 1, please.
Okay, Houston, go ahead. Gemini 4.
... a g.e.t. of 47+00 delete. Translation 2-Alpha. Horizon Scan Mode Set Check, and Horizon Scan Thruster Plume Check.
Gemini 4, at a g.e.t, of 47+00 minutes insert Experiment D-9, Run 1. At G.m.t. of 14 14 00 with OAMS. I say again, with OAMS.
This is Gemini 4 here. Understand at an elapsed time of about 47 hours you want to delete translation 2-Alpha, Horizon Scan Mode Set Check, and Horizon Scan Thruster Plume Check, and insert D-9, Run 1 at 14 14 00 with OAMS.
That is affirmative, Gemini 4. Also concerning Experiment MSC-1, we would like you to turn your ACQ Aid Beacon OFF for a period of about 5 minutes during the period of your MSC-1 Experiment. Recommend you do this between Kano and Carnarvon this pass. Over.
Roger. Understand you want MSC-1 Experiment going to ACQ Aid Beacon turned OFF for 5 minutes.
That's affirmative, Gemini 4. They want about 5 minutes of this experiment with the ACQ Aid Beacon OFF when there are no UHF transmissions.
Do you want me to go to REAL TIME-DELAYED TIME or do you want me to turn OFF the ACQ Aid with the circuit breaker?
Roger. Use the circuit breaker.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston. We'd like a repeat of your food and water report.
From the Pilot, or do you want to do one from me?
That's from the Pilot, please.
Roger. This is the Pilot. About 3 hours ago, I had Meal 2, day 2. I had about 4 or 5 swallows of water. I had a successful yes on defecation bag.
Roger, Gemini 4.
Houston, this is Gemini 4. I just got up. Where are we? What station are we passing over right now?
Roger. We have you Bermuda right now. You just passed through Texas and Canaveral (Kennedy).
Roger.
Good morning, Jim. How do you feel?
Oh, pretty good.
Sound great.
Thank you. How are you?
Had a good night's sleep.
I got a little more sleep this time than I have in the past.
How about that plug in your throat there. Have you taken that out when you were sleeping?
Oh. Negative, I didn't disconnect my radio. I left it on.
Did it bother you at all?
It has been up till now, but this time I guess I was pretty tired, and I slept without it.
Very good. ... Gemini 4, Houston. You can turn your Quantity Read Switch OFF now.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. You can turn your Quantity Read Switch OFF.
Roger, it's OFF.
Roger, you're looking good here. Have a good day.
Roger.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. We have your O<sub>2</sub> tank pressures around 970.
Okay. We're reading about 960. We'll dump ...
Okay. Understand.
When was this going ON?
Cabin temperature is going ON at 13:22.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead, Canary, Gemini 4.
Roger. Request that you use the Cabin Recheck Valve instead of O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. Also, be advised that Houston says do not relieve through the cabin if you can avoid it.
We don't need a push.
We don't have any other place to put the oxygen except in the cabin. We've just finished doing it to the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate. We got the ECS O<sub>2</sub> pressure down to 910.
Roger. They were warning you to avoid relieving through the cabin area.
O<sub>2</sub> pressure down to 910.
Roger. I understand 910.
Can you tell me why they want to use the Repress instead of the O<sub>2</sub> High Rate? Where else would we put the oxygen?
Roger.
Jim, we're not ...
Well, he said that in order to get MSC-1 they wanted the ACQ Aid Beacon OFF for 5 minutes. You know, you were going to leave - to do some ECS on and off ... thruster.
Okay.
Cabin temperature comes ON at - I put it ON already.
I don't know ...
...
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead.
Roger. The reason for using the Repress was to avoid turning off your fans and to cut down on your noise level in your cabin.
Okay.
They meant do not relieve overboard if you can avoid it.
Oh, don't ... they don't want to vent the ECS O<sub>2</sub> tank overboard directly. They want to vent it overboard through the cabin. Is that it?
They don't want to avoid overboard at all if possible.
Roger, I know it.
Okay. Your O<sub>2</sub> usage for the last 24 hours -- correction -- over the last 2 or 3 hours has been 25 percent higher than normal.
Roger. Our cabin's been holding all right. There really doesn't seem to be much we can do about that. That tank pressure goes up and that is just about all there is to it. We're actually venting oxygen overboard that we don't need to.
Roger.
How is our O<sub>2</sub> consumption? I've been plotting it and it looks like we're in reasonably good shape.
It doesn't really call out for my time hack ...
Okay.
... get a drink of something.
I'm thirsty.
Your rate even at your present rate - you have 5 or 10 hours more than you need plus secondary O<sub>2</sub>.
Okay, fine. Thank you.
And I'll try to take your advice and not vent any overboard, but I just don't know how I'm going to do that.
Roger, we understand.
You know, it's going to be tough getting 14 ... recording ...
Aw, hell no.
ACQ Aid Beacon is going OFF at 13:42.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.
All right, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
Roger, what's your status?
We're in good shape.
Roger. You're looking real good here on the ground. I'd like a few readouts from you.
Okay.
I'd like OAMS source helium temp, pressure, and propellant quantity.
Propellant quantity - I have about 61 percent remaining. It fluctuates a little between there and about 63.
Roger. How about your helium temp and helium pressure? OAMS source helium temp and OAMS source helium pressure.
The helium temperature is 58 and the pressure is under 2000.
You say a little under what?
...
Roger.
Okay, we're standing by here on the ground if you need anything.
We're preparing to do Experiment D-9, and we probably won't have any transmissions for you.
Okay. Very good.
Go ahead.
We are starting the first run of Apollo. We have D-9, Ru (illegible)
We haven't picked up Antares, yet. I guess we have 5 minutes to do so, though.
... Antares.
...
...
Looks to me like we're a little ... this Flight Plan.
Is that Antares coming up there now?
... yawed too far to the left.
What?
Corona Australis is coming up.
...
That's the Corona Borealis that should be coming up.
Yes, that's the one ...
Yes.
Is it coming in your side?
Yes ...
Yes, that's right. We're yawed around to the right.
Yes, how's the horizon look?
My horizon's real good.
Just coming in.
High? ... up?
Straight up above.
Okay. Stand by.
Yes, I know. I don't know how they expect us to sight ...
Shucks.
It's an awfully high one to give us.
...
...
Okay, now you ought to be able to see something without any trouble.
The sky?
... come on, yet.
... Southern Cross ... star chart. We ought to be able to see that.
...
I think I see Antares. I can never get down - not in my view.
...
Clear at the top of my window.
Yes ...
I can't possibly - I can't get this down underneath far enough. There, hold on.
...
Way up too high for me.
Too high?
Yes, way too high. I can't possibly get it unless you pitch up to it and yaw back down.
No, - yes, but we didn't get it. I've got Gemini coming up now. No, that's not Gemini, that's part of the Southern Cross.
No, it crossed right through - high.
Yes, I saw it go across the very top of my window. Is that where it was on yours?
Right now, you're not even seeing ...
Okay, now I think it's coming where I can see it.
You've got to have a whole segment ...
I can take a sighting on it now ...
Yes, I got a sighting from it.
Did you?
Yes.
...
Roll to the right.
...
Huh?
...
Yes, roll it.
Yes, the horizon is gone and I ... The star's too high with respect to the horizon.
I know it ... way, way, way too early.
You got to put ... in?
... up. They're in.
Hey, I thought I ...
I'll get the ...
... be perpendicular unless we wait till it gets down lower.
...
Get back up ...
...
It's gone out the top of my window now, Jim. I've got too much horizon.
Yes, that's just too big an angle in there.
It's only 23° right now ...
...
Can you roll it to the left a little bit; I have too much horizon now.
That's what I think. How about rolling it just horizontal?
Oh, boy, there goes all the "O" rings.
Okay.
I can't get the horizon.
Okay.
How are you?
I can't ... star.
The horizon's gone now.
When?
I don't have a horizon anymore.
Disappeared.
Yes.
Same here with me. I don't know whether I'm up, down, sideways, or anything else. I like to at least know the orientation.
Okay, we never got a good one on that.
Okay, we've been running into problems.
We tried to get Antares twice.
Can you see into this side?
Not ... try bring myself around.
You can control it if you like.
I might be able to get it better that way.
Where'd my book go?
Oh, shoot!
... horizon comes back ...
Okay, I got it. But before I can shoot any stars I've got to get this stuff behind me, or I won't see a star. What are you looking for? Okay. I've got it pitched this way and roll it back in there or I won't see anything.
I guess it's not.
See any stars?
A few stars - okay. Yaw more to the right.
Okay. The stars are back out again.
No, I didn't expect ...
What I have to do is keep my window shaded all of the time.
Yes.
Out of the sun and then I can see.
Oh yes, I can see stars.
... of the stars in ... 178, that's pretty good ...
...
I haven't got any horizon pictures..
...
No, what I see now ...
What I wanted to try to do ... Are you dark over there?
...
...
I don't see the stars. Do you?
... one time.
I'm supposed to have the proper attitude.
I can roll back over now, though.
...
Yes. ...
Got to keep the horizon in there.
...
I don't think we do. I'm in a good black now.
...
As far as the shade. I'm shaded enough ...
... the star and the sky.
Neither can I.
...
Okay, you go ahead and see if you can find any.
...
They're just not there.
Okay, let me try it. ...
Okay.
... the recorder OFF.
... the recorder OFF.
...
...
Yes, ...
Okay, we're starting to pitch up close to the horizon now, and ...
Okay. Blunt-end-forward so the sun's behind us.
I still see no stars.
No, neither can I.
I have a black sky out there, but I'm getting reflection off the window. How about you?
Yes, I get a lot of reflections off that dirty outside part.
Half of my window is black and the other has a little sun shining on it. Sun shining on the nose of the spacecraft so I've got to look past a lighted object. I don't see a star, and I never have seen the stars in the daylight... much better at sunrise when half the spacecraft is dark and the other half is light.
Yes, then you can see it.
Okay, my window's in the sunlight. How about yours?
Mine's in sunlight too ...
Heck, I guess that what we're saying is that ... [Experiment] D-9 cannot be done in the daylight.
I concur.
Right now, there doesn't seem to be a way for us to find any stars in the daylight.
No, it sure doesn't. There's no way you can see them.
There is certainly no way to do it after ...
Okay.
... a long window. A window that has a long ... off the window where you can look straight off the ...
...
... okay, ... look out ...
I don't see a star anywhere.
I know I can't. I've got direct sunshine on my window.
...
...
... nose of the spacecraft.
Yes.
Yes ...
Okay.
My window's not in the light anymore, and I still don't see the stars. If there's any possibility in the world to see stars in the daylight and horizon at the same time, I'm in the position right now where I should be able to do it. And don't have the sun on the nose of the spacecraft. It's on the bottom. I can see the bottom, and I can't see a single star, not a single star.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Roger, are you busy with [Experiment] D-9?
No, I think it just drew to a close. We just can't see the stars in the daylight, and we can't carry on the daylight portion of it. We'll wait till we get back to the nighttime and do a little bit more with that.
Roger, Jim. I want to talk to you about this O<sub>2</sub> high usage rate thing.
Okay.
We don't think it's any problem. We would like for you to put your Quantity Read Switch ON and leave it on for the next several hours so we can get a feel for what's going on. Even at the rate that's been used in the last several hours, it won't be any problem, but we'd like to find some way to control this thing without it being a nuisance to use so you won't be bothered with it. That's the reason we want to take a look at it for some time. Don't like the idea of you having to reduce pressures or build up pressure every few minutes. Do you read me?
Houston, Gemini 4. I got the part where we leave the Read Switch ON for a while, and then all the rest cut off. Say again.
Okay. Jim, how do you read me now?
... for the next couple hours. Say after that.
Wait till we get Bermuda acquisition. I'll try you there.
Gemini 4, Houston. How do you read now?
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
What I was saying - we want to get a hack on what's going on with that pressure buildup in the Primary O<sub>2</sub> system. We want to try to find some way to control it without you having to relieve cabin pressure every few minutes or every few hours, so this is the reason we want your Quantity Read Switch ON for the next several hours.
Okay. What did you say about my usage rate?
It's a little bit higher than it has been, but it is nothing to worry about. You have plenty so don't be concerned about it.
Okay. I've been plotting it, and it looks like we're going to end up with 7 or 8 percent remaining.
Yes, we're just trying to find some way to keep you from having to relieve the cabin pressure every now and then.
Okay. Yes, I don't like that either.
Yes.
The Flight Surgeon would like to know if either one of you had any trouble with drying around the eyes or dry throat.
My throat is a little dry, and our eyes were bothering us about the end of the first day quite a bit, but that's all cleared up now.
Okay. Very good.
Hey, Gus. Can you get me a G.m.t. hack?
Roger. I'll give it to you at 14 45 00. In about 20 seconds.
Roger. 14 45 ...
Ten seconds to go.
14 45 00 on my mark.
MARK!
Roger, 14 45 00.
Any complaints?
No, except this thing isn't very big.
On your next pass over the States we'll have the latest news for you.
Okay, very good.
Ed and I were just commenting that the weightlessness gives you a light-headed feeling, a heady feeling.
But not a heady feeling ...
Yes, I did, and Ed was saying that his headache is gone. He had one earlier.
And I don't have one yet, but I feel closer to having one now than I have had at any time. I think it's this darn 100 percent oxygen. I breathe it in and I don't think I've ever been this dry. With the worst cold I've ever had, where I can't breathe through my nose and I sound like I've got a big deep cold. I sound to myself like I'm very ... but I can now if I - I was when I was sleeping, too. But it was burning my nose, actually, when I was sleeping. I had a very hoarse sound to myself. Do I sound that way to you, too?
Yes.
... But I think because of this 100 percent oxygen where I kept assimilating it. I suspect that maybe my ears and my sinuses are always below ambient and I know I've got to pop my ears about every hour or two.
I have a little ...
Yes, my mouth and my throat are quite dry at this time. As a matter of fact, I think we ought to have a drink of water.
You ought to put a little female velcro on the ...
We're traveling across Africa right now. I'm in the Pulse Mode. We had a rather unsuccessful portion of [Experiment] D-9. We're going to ...
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
This is Gemini 4, here, Canary. Go ahead.
Roger. You still look real good.
Okay. Listen. Be advised that I've just been maintaining my own little personal plot of ECS O<sub>2</sub>, and I don't see any increase in quantity used in the rate over the last few hours. It looks like my ragged plot is still going to come out about what it looked like it would right after we got ...
Houston concurs.
Okay.
Aw, shoot.
I'm just going to come around to Small-End-Forward, kill off my yaw, get in the attitude that I'd be in to cage the platform.
I want to get into ... attitude, Ed, and I want you to tell me what you think it is... 00 attitude pitch, 0 attitude pitch.
MARK!
... Got one of those, haven't we?
Yes ...
That's 60°?
Yes.
...
... 30°.
...
...
... 30° pitchup.
... all dry. Yes.
...
... yawed way off.
Let's see. What else did the Flight Plan ...
...
How does the roll look to you now, Ed?
Okay.
How about pitch?
...
Well, I've got it just about on the horizon. How about yaw? What do you say we're doing on yaw?
...
We yawed right.
Okay, we yawed right. That's what I think, too. About 10° or so. You tell me if we're yawing around ... to the left. ... you tell me when we get to ...
...
Stand by. Yes, we do.
Okay, I'd say they're right there. ...
Yes, I'd say we're within a couple of degrees.
Okay. Very good. Looks to me like I've yawed left a little bit.
...
Okay. Now I think I've yawed zero right there, Ed. What do you think?
Zero or just a little left. Right there.
Okay.
The ES sensor is coming off at this time.
The right side of my head is getting sore where I keep rubbing the hair the wrong way when I try to turn my head inside my helmet so that I can look through the window long ways. Get the best view I can through it.
Okay, we're just now approaching darkness again and we're looking at stars with small-end-forward and as yet, I don't see any. It's under my ...
...
I think it does too, Ed.
Okay, now half of what I see is light and the other half is dark. So we're going a little bit sideways to the small-end-forward, but Ed's side is in the dark completely, I believe. Isn't it, Ed?
I see a star ...
Okay. First star was at 15:12 - 15 12 52 it was.
Right.
...
We haven't crossed the terminator yet. You have a horizon out there now, though, Ed.
...
No ... yet. My side's still in sunlight.
...
My side of the spacecraft is bathed in the sunlight and I don't see the star.
...
Yes, I get the distinct impression that the upper part of my window is a lot dirtier than the lower part. Do you have that impression too, Ed?
...
No, I think the gradation of this goop that's all over it, whatever it is, looks like it's on about here on up - looks like it's on about the zero pitch line on up.
There's plenty of stars out there, now.
Okay, I still don't have any stars.
There's a very pretty horizon out there now.
Okay, I have my first star. - I'm quite sure that this coating on my window is about zero pitch attitude line on up. I can see a star down below that ... you'd think I'd be able to see it. It might just be the peculiar way the reflections are coming back through the window.
Okay, Edward, I'm going to leave the recorder on until it runs out.
I've done that already.
What ... You just ... as we go along?
... start out with a very fuzzy horizon ...
It does what?
It ...
Oh, okay. Yes ... I can see that. As a matter of fact, let me take a picture of that phenomenon right now.
...
I don't think we got anything there. It wasn't set on the right lens opening for that. Whoops! What happened to the ...
...
To the Hasselblad, the winders ...
...
...
Yes.
...
Okay ...
Try to get up high enough to get the stars ... horizon.
Yes, they need to fix this ...
...
No. No, I don't see any stars really at all, here.
...
Okay, well, use those.
I don't have reference to them.
No horizon, you mean?
... that is the Big Dipper.
Let's not use any more fuel on this thing.
Yes. Yes, go ahead and give it a couple of more squirts, whatever you think you need ... try to take about two measurements here, Ed.
... stars out here right now ... up too high to get them without ...
Are you seeing those multiple images?
No, I focused ...
I was doing it in the complete dark and maybe I was ...
Do you have ...
Yes.
I see Leo coming out, but they're too low now.
... they're going to rise.
Huh?
They're going to rise. Use Leo.
... bank in.
Okay.
How high up is it?
...
Okay. Well, let's run a series of Leo. Is Regulus up yet?
I'm going to stop my event time, since we're not using it.
...
06:30.
6° 30 minutes.
MARK!
4°, 55 1/2.
MARK!
8°, 45.
Are you ...
...
Let me get ...
Go ahead.
Hey, Altair is up there. Let's see, this thing I was looking at is probably Vega.
It was Vega.
...
On Altair and I'll use a green filter, no filter ...
I have 16° and 55 minutes. The second one is ...
Yes, couldn't you?
...
Okay, 19° and 29 minutes.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
...
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
Go ahead, Carnarvon. Gemini 4.
Okay. You're looking good here on the ground. How are you doing?
Doing fine.
Okay. We don't have anything here for you. You have gone by two full days, and we'll keep standing by here if you need anything.
Okay. We're trying to take some star measurements right now, so we probably won't be talking too much.
That's right.
23:51.
23:51?
23:51.
Has the nose started to get in the way?
Yes, sure has. ...
Well, with a constellation like that. It's a big one.
... Vega that I saw before.
You got it identified?
...
Yes. Altair.
Altair ...
Mark again.
30° and 6 minutes.
How much?
30° and 6 minutes.
What kind of a filter?
That's a clear filter. How many measurements have I taken? Five?
Four. Four.
The first two were clear, second was ... and the third and fourth were clear.
Try one of those.
... I kind of lost all ... now.
...
Well, I've had it down ... when I came back.
I think I've probably blocked him out, he's too high.
Yes, okay.
We should spend the night side here doing, just taking pictures -- taking sightings without a particular attitude. The object of the game is to nail a couple of ones right off the bat that you know of and use them.
Oh, that looks like Vega there ... Deneb coming up.
Okay.
I think their kind of programming for us is no good. I think we'd do better if we make our own sightings.
Yes. I think we ought to knock off on the ..., Ed.
Okay.
Well, okay, let's leave it on and see what we do. If we need one or two pulses we'll do it.
Okay.
Okay, there's Deneb. I'll start a series with Deneb.
Altair's perfect and has no ... around it.
Yes.
... and maybe I can hold it better that way.
Okay.
I'm ... right to the top of the row. 18:33 ...
Okay, why don't we knock off the ...
Yes, I think ... fuel ...
I know you do ... don't have ...
Yes, that's what I say -- you -- makes it exciting, you know. I think we got a few readings there for them.
Yes.
Let me make a little comment on it. The green filter, to me, made a rather -- a little bit of ...
The one time - the other time I tried to use it, I got a pretty good measure on it the next time. The ... using no filter, I used the top of the glow of the thick layer of the air glow. It's a rather nebulous -- you've got to kind of calibrate your own eyeball and try to put it in the same place each time ... It takes definite attitude control to make these measurements. You can't expect to make these measurements without using any fuel. It's such a small window, you have to pick up your star and bring it down to the horizon keeping the horizon and the star in your field of view.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
... Gemini 4 here.
Roger. I'm reading you weak. You read me okay?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. You're clear now. You ready for your 33-1 time?
Stand by just a second.
Roger.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. 47 ft/sec out of your forward-firing. That's 1+18. 120 ft/sec out of the aft. That's 2+31. At 17 42 53. 2+48. 8+49. And the 33-1 time without burn 17 36 33. 7+36. 4+58. Correction on that last 14+58. Want to read those back to me?
Houston, Gemini 4. I didn't get either one of those. Say again.
Okay. 47 ft/sec and 1+18 on your forward-firing. 120 ft/sec and 2+31 on your aft-firing, at 17 42 53. 2+48. 8+49.
Roger. Got 'em. Go ahead with the other one.
Okay. Without burn 17 36 33. 7+36. 14+58.
Okay. Got them that time.
Okay. If you will turn your computer on, we'll give you an update.
Roger. Computer coming on.
Jim, we'd like you to make a Main Battery Check, if you would, please.
Roger. We are making a Main Battery Check, right now.
Okay.
Okay, we got computer light - running light on. You can go ahead.
Okay. Computer light on.
Okay, on your D-9 Experiment.
Roger.
Okay, we'd like for you to try to see stars on the daylight side with the earth shine and not in view. Just forget the sextant; just get dark adapted the best you can on the daylight side and see if you can pick out some stars.
Roger, we tried that and we can't -- we were not able to pick out any stars on the daylight side.
Okay. Then we'd like to know what filters were satisfactory on the sextant.
Okay. We have some notes on that. Listen, I think on the 33rd Rev, if at all possible I'd like to take those ... shots across the Southwestern United States on Rev. 5.
Roger.
I said, I sure would like to get that out of the way.
Okay, we'll run it through our Flight Plan section here and let you know.
Okay, I think it would be foolhardy to run any more D-9 Experiments in the daylight, because that is hopeless.
Okay, fine. Coming over the States here at G.m.t. of 16:11, they'd like you to make some weather pictures. There're some thundershowers up north of us.
Okay.
I guess you've already passed that now. Maybe you can get 'em next time around.
All right. Ed was taking some pictures. I don't know what he was taking pictures of, though.
Okay.
I think he got some terrain pictures.
Okay. Are you ready for your little news release?
Roger.
Okay. All of the big headlines, of course, are still about what you are doing and particularly about seeing that satellite up there yesterday. Also, the conversation with the wives is getting a big play.
Okay.
Things in Vietnam have quieted down, and not too much going on over there right now.
Okay.
The Oilers are going to play in the Rice Stadium instead of the Domed Stadium.
They are!
Yes. Apparently they couldn't get together on the rental price. Bud Adams was quoted as saying that the Dome may be the eighth wonder of the earth, but the rental price is surely the ninth wonder.
Aw, shucks! Hey, Gus, have you tried to figure out what I saw out there over Hawaii and Guaymas?
Have you figured it out? You saw it.
I don't know. I took a picture of it but the sun came across the window right after I saw it. I only ... 15 seconds.
I haven't heard any more about it, Jim. We'll look into it.
Okay.
You have a valid load, and you can turn your computer off now. That gives you a TR time of 36-4 in the computer.
Very good.
Hey, Jim. Gemini 4, CAP COM.
Roger. Go ahead.
Near as we can tell, the only satellite it could be would be Pegasus, from what we note here.
That's what I thought it might be, too.
Okay.
Hey. The Astros did beat the Cards yesterday, 5 to 2. They're still in sixth place though.
Okay. He's got this information for you.
Go ahead.
The batteries were 9 and 22.5.
Roger. 9 and 22.5.
All the rest of the electrical readings are up.
Say again.
The rest of the electrical readings are normal.
Okay. Fine.
Next time you bleed down your primary oxygen pressure, bring it all the way down to about 800 psi. We can't find much else that we can do about the thing. Just bring it down lower so you are working through a wider band. We don't think that is going to cause you to use any.
Roger. Bring it down. Listen, I just then ran the thing up to about 5 1/4, and I'm trying to hold it at 5 1/4 with the Repress ... hold it. If not, I'll bring it down to around 800.
Okay. We think you can go way down in your pressure now without hurting anything, so if it gets to be a nuisance just bring it on down so that you don't have to watch it so close and be bothered with it too much.
...
I can't read you very good right now. Wait until we get to Bermuda again, will you?
Okay.
At about 16:03, as we came across on this last pass, across the Gulf of California, the Mexico side, we were in a perfect small-end-forward down attitude so I took a series of seven or eight photographs of the terrain ... stereographic ...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. This is Gemini 4.
Roger. Could you give us an estimate as to how far that satellite was from you yesterday?
I couldn't really tell. It looked like quite a large object, and it looked like I was closing on it rather rapidly. Distance is rather hard to judge. I'd say 10 miles or so.
10 miles?
That's just a guess. I really can't tell. I was close enough where I could see -
You were close enough to see what?
... arms and cylindrical things sticking out.
You're cutting up pretty badly, there. I couldn't read that.
Okay.
Well, that came through good.
All right. I said, I got close enough to it ...
Close enough to it to what?
...
Well, as near as we can tell, there wasn't anything that close to you. Pegasus was about 1200 miles away.
No, it wasn't quite that close -- that far away.
Pretty good eyeballs, all right.
Well, I took a picture of it. I just hope it comes out.
So do we.
Unfortunately -
Are you using VOX, because you are cutting out.
No, I'm using continuous interphone, PUSH-TO-TALK. How do you read me now?
Good. Every now and then the last part of your sentence cuts off.
Okay, maybe I have a weak thumb. Listen, would you ask the doctors if it's okay if I use this exerciser?
If you use it?
... but I'd still like to get more exercise than I'm getting.
Sure, go ahead.
Okay.
Just let us know how much you use it, if you will?
I sure wi11. But I -
It's okay. Go ahead and use it.
Okay, use it ...
Say again.
Can I use it -
You're cutting out again. Go ahead and say again.
May I use the exerciser like the M-3 exercise?
Affirmative.
Okay. Thank you.
Gemini 4, CAP COM
Roger. Go ahead.
Do you have a time back at the exact time you saw the satellite?
No, I do not. I called it out on the radio. It ought to be on the tape.
Okay.
I also put it on the voice recorder in here, so we can go back and look for it.
Okay. But at the exact time you saw it, you put it on tape?
That's right.
On the radio?
Roger.
Hey, Jim.
Go ahead.
Why do you want to use the exerciser? Are you feelin' stiff, cramped, or what?
Yes ...
Say again.
... been in orbit two days, and haven't ...
It's garbled. I couldn't read it.
I say, I just haven't moved around very much and I ...
Okay. That makes sense.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Canary, this is Gemini 4. Go ahead.
Roger. You look good and GO from the ground.
Roger. Everything is GO and fine up here.
Canary, Gemini 4. Am I passing right over your site at this time?
You're getting close. You're passing well to the south of us.
Canary, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. You're not passing over us at this time.
... at this time?
Say again.
I can't read you. I think I just passed over your island.
Roger, you are passing over Cape Verde.
Okay, I'll look down and see you. I saw you standing outside waving.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. If you read, insert the oral temp ... Command Pilot's mouth.
You need not acknowledge, but you look good here on the ground.
We're receiving your oral temp.
Pump a little further on your blood pressure.
Cuff full-scale.
Will you pump up that blood pressure again?
Cuff full-scale.
...
Okay. We've got a valid oral temp. Remove the probe. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear.
Okay. I've got some update information for you.
Stand by just a second.
Okay.
Is this Flight Plan or retro times?
These are S-5 and Apollo Landmark runs.
Okay.
For S-5, it'll be Rev 32 over the States instead of Rev 33. The pass will start at 17+40. And I want you to make an Apollo Landmark Run no. 4.
I got the stuff for S-5. Say again the Apollo no. 4. Is that Rev 30?
... cups of water in addition to this, since the last time I saw you. I had about a 4-hour nap, and that's the best sleep I've had so far.
You look good on the ground here, too. Can you say again the water?
I've had about 10 or 15 gulps of water since I woke up.
Very good.
I'm going to have another 10 or 15 here, as soon as I get through eating.
Okay, fine. That's all we need. Surgeon out.
... 19:15 Zulu.
Okay. Start 19:15. ... 19 16 42.
Roger. That's a good thing.
Okay. Is this without fuel or with fuel?
We'll get you squared away.
Okay.
That'll be with fuel. With fuel.
Okay. With fuel.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Hawaii.
Gemini 4, Hawaii.
Gemini 4.
Roger. We have your T/M solid. All systems look good on the ground. I have a map update for you when you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Roger. Rev 33. G.m.t. 18 51 44. Longitude 151° East. Did you copy? Over.
Roger. Rev 33. G.m.t. 18 51 44. 151° East. Thank you.
Roger. Hawaii CAP COM standing by.
Roger.
We're going to run our first real S-6 now, rather S-5, which will be a series of 35 photographs on the 32nd Rev, coming over the Western part of the United States. They will be done at 5-second intervals.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Roger. Are you real busy now, Jim?
Well, we're just about to start this S-5. What can I do for you?
Well, you go ahead. I'll get you to give me a call when you get done, and I'll pass up this other information to you.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. We'll need your computer on.
It's on.
Roger. Computer on.
... Roger.
Okay, completion of this run was at 17:47 and we ran off to counter number 39. We started about 1 or 2. We ran off about 35 or 36 pictures.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Roger, Gemini 4. Go ahead with your update.
Roger. It's 40 feet. Did you get the last one I gave you?
Negative, I never got 36-4.
Okay. 36-4 40 ft/sec forward. That's 1+06. 120 ft/sec aft at 2+31. At 23 38 08. 2+48. 8+43.
Roger. Was that 2+48 and 8+43?
Affirmative.
Okay. We would like to know if you have your Squib Battery 1 off?
Roger, we just bumped off.
Okay. Fine.
Okay. You have a valid 36-4 in your computer. You can turn your computer off.
Okay. Computer's off.
Okay, and if you want to -- in fact, we'd like you to update all of your Type 2 Medical Passes to Type 1. That'll give you a little more exercise.
Okay. Very good. All Type 2's to Type 1.
Okay, and how much has Ed been sleeping the last couple of hours? Can you give us a clue on that?
Roger. Ed's only had about an hour nap. We're going to have to rearrange our sleep cycle a little bit, too.
Okay. Have you felt rested with the amount of sleep you've got, or do you think you'll need some more?
No, I don't think we're getting an awful lot of rest out of it, but on the other hand, we're not doing much so we're really not too tired. I think we'll go through this next pass, and Ed'll go back to sleep again.
Okay. The other thing is, when you were doing your maneuvering during the first orbit, did you get that recorded on your onboard tape?
You mean on my voice onboard tape?
Yes.
Say again.
Yes. Did you get any of that - did you get it recorded on your onboard tape?
Roger. We got a good bit of it.
Okay. Good.
Hey, we'd like you to bring your Primary O<sub>2<sub> pressure down to 800. It's up to - we're reading it at 960.
Okay. I've got 950. We'll bring it on down.
Okay.
Gus, on this - what's on the Voice Tape Recorder - they say we were turning it on and off. So we don't have it all.
Say again.
Say again, Jim.
Say again, Houston.
Say again.
Hey, Jim. This is Gus again. Do you read Houston still?
I'm not reading you.
Hey, do you want to talk to your wives next pass?
Sure.
Okay. If you want them, we'll put them on.
Okay, on that last pass we took about 38 pictures on the Synoptic Terrain Photography, starting a little bit east of San Diego and until we ran into the cloud coverage again. We picked up with intermittent pictures as soon as we started over the southern part of the United States down around Alabama and Mississippi and on across to Florida. We got some very good pictures of the weather in that area, then we got some pictures of the air fields around Jacksonville. We took a couple of pictures of the Cape. Probably one of the best pictures we got was one shooting back, and we got the whole weather formation along the coastline starting with Florida and going all the way back to Texas. A very well defined line of weather following closely to the coastline. Then we took some pictures of the weather formation in the State of Florida, around Cuba and the island area, and into the gulf ... weather build-ups, clouds, and we took a couple of pictures of the island, some very good pictures. We ended up taking up 55 pictures.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Just saw a satellite, very high, ... spotted away like a star on the ground when you see one go by. A long, long ways away. When I saw this satellite go by, we were pointed just about directly overhead. It looked like it was going from left to the right. ... back towards the west, so it must have been going from south to north.
The fix on the vent valve and the ECS O<sub>2<sub> was very cleverly fixed to take care of John's complaint that it vented out of scale. Now, of course, it vents down into the scale and causes quite a bit of problem, as everyone knows, with the oxygen. The problem still lies in getting the ... in here ...
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead, Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Roger, read you loud and clear. I've got a long list of updates for you. Let me know when you're ready to copy.
Roger, stand by one, please.
Go ahead.

Correction. That'll be 11+30.
Roger. Roger, got them.
Okay, 36-DELTA 84 forward, 43 aft, 2+19. 0+55. 22 40 42. 12+17.

Roger.
38-DELTA 100. 2+07. 01 49 14. 12+01.
Roger.
0kay, I want to go back and check that 35-DELTA. The GMTRC should be 21 07 34, and the next number is 11+30. Did you copy that one?
That's affirmative. Got it. Got them all and those are good calls.
Okay, thanks. The people back in Houston would like some kind of a spare moment to try and describe on your onboard voice tape recorder everything you remember that happened on your first rev.
Roger, we'll try to describe everything that happened on the first rev on the onboard tape recorder. We've already done that.
Okay, very good.
Roger, everything looks GO up here.
Okay, it looks real good here on the ground.
Roger.
Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
All right, go ahead.
What's my latest apogee-perigee?
I'll get you a new one. Hold on a second.
We have not ... This pass we'll get it for you.
Okay, okay, Carnarvon.
Go ahead.
You might advise Houston that as far as we're concerned S-5 and S-6 are complete. Do not do any more flight planning.
Okay. Complete on the S-5 and S-6. We got that.
Okay, here's your apogee-perigee 88.1 148.7.
Roger. 88.1. 148.7.
There you go.
And they say you got a real low decay rate.
Roger.
It's a streamlined capsule.
Say again.
It's a streamlined capsule.
The fellow sitting next to you is streamlined.
Roger.
And I say this is a streamlined capsule.
Roger.
Your boss says it's incredible.
Rog.
Gemini 4, Hawaii.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Do you copy?
Roger, Hawaii. Gemini 4. I read you.
Roger. We would like to request you take a cabin humidity reading, and a hatch temperature reading.
Roger. Say that again, you're oscillating.
Roger, request a cabin humidity reading and a hatch temperature reading.
Okay, we just finished doing that a little while ago. About half-way around on the night side the hatch temperature was 67°, and stand by and I'll give those others.
Roger.
Roger, the cabin dry bulb was around 72°, 73°, and the wet bulb was around 60°. Stand by and I'll give you the relative humidity in just a minute.
Hawaii. That relative humidity is about 61 percent.
Roger. Copy 61.
Also have update for your Apollo D-9 run whenever you're ready to copy.
Gemini, Hawaii.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM on UHF. Do you copy?
Gemini 4, on UHF. Do you read?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM on UHF. Do you read?
Gemini 4, on UHF. Do you copy?
Gemini 4.
Roger, I have some updates for your Apollo D-9, Rev 33.
Standing by. Waiting until you're ready to copy.
Okay, go ahead.
Roger, Rev 33, run 4, start time 19 43 00, that's sunset time. End 0-20. I repeat 20 19 00, which is sunrise. Did you copy? Over.
Roger. We got them.
Also, would like to advise that you will have a SPADATS test on Rev 34 over Antigua. Your ES sensor should be switched on from 19 20 00 to 19 35 00. Did you copy? Over.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Did you copy them? The last?
It looks like ... over to the right about 10° ...
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4.
We want both of you to drink lots more water. Do you read?
Gemini 4, do you read?
Roger, this is Gemini 4. Reading you broken up, but stand by one. We're going to be running a ...
I didn't read.
Roger, stand by for about five.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4. Stand by for about 5 minutes, we'll be working on this Apollo Tracking Project and we'll be back up with you.
Roger.
I just saw one down there ...
Is it real white?
No, it's not that white.
... white pants. There's a lot of clouds up there.
Going over Mexico, I think ...
...
Huh?
...
I never saw it over here. Look here ...
...
I can't believe we missed ...
No, neither can I. We sure have ...
This looks like the area coming up on us now, Jim. There's the Big Bend. I believe we're past it, Jim.
Yaw and let's take a picture of the Big Bend. Can you? Here, let me see if I can get it.
...
All right. See if you can pick up ...
I'm going to track on the -- see that white spot up there along the coast?
I think this is Corpus Christi coming up here. Over there, you might be able to pick up an air field down there.
Yes.
... that white spot down there.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Do you read?
Roger, stand by, please.
All right ... but not too ...
...
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Do you read?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Is it clear?
Let's try to get those this time.
If you're tired, I'll give you some help.
I got a lot of the horizon over here. You might roll back to the left a little bit.
Now, there's the horizon -- that's what the horizon does. You can't see it now, but the horizon changes between sunset and sunrise. Quite a bit.
As a matter of fact. I want to take a picture of this.
I took a picture with the long lens to show how the horizon changes between sunset and sunrise.
Okay.
Yes. You got it?
That's what I was going to do.
...
...
Man, I can't see anything now.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Felt that?
Yes, that really wipes me out. Very, very ... I can see they ...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
How is the horizon?
The horizon's not bad.
How is it supposed to be, -- we're supposed to be ...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
... yaw around to the right ...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Look at those stars.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM Over.
How do you like that stuff?
Got a yaw, now roll right.
There's something wrong.
I hate to tell you, Jim. I can't recognize any of them.
Okay, I've got the ... Now, roll over to the right.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Okay. Shoot some pictures.
..., Ed.
Okay, I ...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Look down below.
I'll pitch up, Jim.
It's going up now?
Got to go faster. It's going up faster than we are.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
How's that! Is it going faster?
I'm catching up now.
Are you making an aim to your right and come around ...
I want you to yaw, pitch back down.
You want me to pitch down now?
No, not till I get there.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Okay, start pitching down.
Is that enough?
No. -- Yes.
How are we doing?
Okay.
If I could find the horizon, I got it hacked. I got the star, and I got the blue filter on. It cut everything out except my star, pretty well. But I haven't got down to the horizon yet.
This thing, I think, could do with an eye stabilization.
Yes, I think it can too, Ed. I said that ... ... looked like ... too.
Hey, am I down too low? I've got a lot of horizon in my window.
No, I think that pitch is right.
...
Okay, I'm ready to start taking a measurement here in a minute.
Okay, when I put the blue filter on, the horizon is gone.
You are right! It's this blue filter.
Right.
How about the green filter?
Right now, both of them. I think it's such a dark night.
The green filter I have cut out most of the airglow.
It leaves me a little tiny band. And it's pretty hard to measure from.
Why don't you get that band and see what kind of angles you get?
Well, I want to try. I don't think I ought to use that filter.
Nope.
Not yet.
Why don't you do a, say, ... after it went out.
Well, it's such a little bit, it's almost ...
Yes, the airglow is pretty dim. Not glowing very much, is it?
No.
I've been taking some measurements on the horizon ...
Okay.
The star went out the top of the ...
The star went out the top. I couldn't hold it anymore.
Okay, you want me to do the next one then?
No, let me try one more hack at it.
That will hold, maybe ... a little better.
We found out that the filters aren't too good.
Yes, I planned on playing a lot around with the filters, just themselves when you were sleeping. The next thing I was going to do, I was just going to get the sextant out and play with the filters and stuff.
...
I'm taking my helmet off.
Yes ...
How you doing?
What?
Got them yet?
What?
Okay, what was that question again? I can't hear very well.
Gus?
Okay, go ahead ... What is it? Now tell me what they are.
Tell me what they are, now.
Okay, start with the third reading.
11:27. What?
Is it okay for you?
I think that's true.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
You're taking your helmet off and the clear filter. Right?
...
What is it, Ed?
...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM Over.
What was it?
... 120th.
You want the (illegible) down? You want to go to ... We're ... You think it might help?
...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
You okay, huh?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
That help you?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Say again ... 16 minutes.
Okay now. Use that curve.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Use that curve for ... Yaw right? Left or right?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
You're using Arcturus, instead.
It isn't a simple task, is it?
How're we doing?
You okay?
...
Hello.
Want me to pitch down?
MARK!
Yaw to the left.
Boy, there's a nice horizon out there now. The moon is setting and the airglow layer and the ...
MARK!
34 28 1/2. Approximately ...
What?
It was planned.
Why do you put a question mark after it?
You use the wrong star?
I used the green filter.
Yaw left? -- Yaw left.
How's that?
What?
What are you talking about? Is that what it was? Did you get the reading?
... Centauri, ... Go!
Any star we could find would be a good deal.
Ready to yaw around to the right?
Okay. Rigel Kentauri is one them. -- which one is Rigel Kentauri?
... get away an attitude.
The one farthest away. Rigel Kentauri ...
Golly. How do they expect ...
What?
Why don't you take one of the Southern Cross stars, then?
...
What? -- Well, I think when we finish the flight work ...
Are there any known stars out there close to the horizon?
Yes. ...
Are there any stars close to the horizon?
The green filter is the best?
Gemini 4, CRO.
Gemini 4, CRO CAP COM.
Gemini 4, CRO CAP COM.
Gemini 4, CRO. Do you read? It looks like we're losing some power leads. Will you push them down on your chest. Push them down.
And if you read, give me ... from the cryogenic gage ... Quantity Read Switch.
Roger. Got that.
Okay. Standing wave looks much better now.
Ed thinks that you need to ... to control the spacecraft for angles over 20°. On the same token, I noticed you were going through some pretty big gyrations ...
Yes, because you're left ...
If you got time, we've got one more ... for you.
...
The blue filter cuts the whole horizon out.
The blue filter.
27. What?
What did you hear that time?
No filter the first time, right?
Got a battery ... Got another ...
Right, Ed?
Ed, turn the ACME power supply off.
Ed, do you have the Blood Pressure Bulb?
Got Gemini? No.
... testers on.
Gemini 4, CSQ CAP COM. Do you copy?
We have a good oral count. We have a good oral count.
Start your blood pressure and stand by for Surgeon on your HF.
Roger.
Gemini 4, this is Surgeon. On your blood pressure.
Pressure coming up ... on the temperature.
Roger. We got your temp.
You're blocked out. Say again.
Roger, we got your temp, and we now have a fullscale on your cuff.
Gemini 4, do you read?
You're blocked out. Say again, please.
Gemini 4, this is Surgeon. We have got a temperature and now have a full-scale on your cuff.
Roger.
Gemini 4, this is Surgeon. We received your blood pressure, and you can start your exercise on your mark.
Gemini 4, do you read?
CSQ Surgeon, Gemini 4, ... blood pressure ...
Gemini 4, Surgeon. You're broken. Would you say again?
Surgeon, did you get a good blood pressure?
Roger. We got a good blood pressure. You can start your exercise on your mark.
Gemini 4, Surgeon. Do you read?
Roger, Gemini 4. Did you get a good blood pressure?
Roger. We got a good blood pressure. You can start your exercise on your mark.
Roger. He has already started and will be sending you his blood pressure in a moment.
Roger.
He's finished.
Roger. He's stopped. Okay, we'll have a blood pressure.
Gemini 4, Surgeon. We have both full-scale on cuff.
Roger.
Pilot, this is Surgeon. Chuck Berry says no reason not to get 8 hours if you so desire. Do you read?
Roger, understand.
Can we now hold it off on our ... Right now and we got a little off on our ... We'll try to pick up the schedule and get back on it.
Roger.
And the Pilot missed the sleep period starting a little after 28 hours elapsed time ...
We now have a valid blood pressure. We would like to have a detailed eating, drinking, and sleep report from the Command Pilot, please.
Surgeon, this is Command Pilot.
Roger.
... drinking my last ... 25 gulps of water.
You are broken. How many gulps of water, please?
About 25.
Roger. 25.
How about sleep?
Roger ...
Roger. Would you repeat your eating? Did you say finished A-1 and the first part of A-2?
Gemini 4, Surgeon, CSQ Surgeon. Would you repeat your eating?
I'd like to comment a little on the sextant. Its use in a cramped spacecraft is very difficult, particularly with the helmet on. I finally decided it was going to be useless with your helmet on to try to take the angles that the stars, that were being called for, required. So I took my helmet off. This gave me a little more flexibility in using it, but still I was limited to angles of about 20 to 23° without maneuvering the spacecraft. What would happen is the star would be cut out by the upper part of the window. Now, by more frequent and liberal maneuvering of the spacecraft you could maneuver it so that you have the long axis of the window in your tracking plane. We were somewhat limited by fuel and we didn't choose to maneuver in this manner. We used Pulse Mode, too, without a lot of maneuvers. The stars that were selected for that run were ones that had rather high angles so the horizon and, therefore, were very difficult to get. We finally decided to go ahead and get the stars a little closer to the horizon. I ran a couple on Canopus and a couple of others, as you'll notice. The blue filter seemed to block out the horizon totally; I didn't have any horizon when I used that. Our horizon image probably is not as good when there is moonlight. The green filter, though, gave me what I would consider a little clearer horizon than I had with no filter at all. I felt there was not a difficulty in making these measurements with either the green or clear filter. Still, the horizon is not very well defined and you have to kind of standardize yourself and measure on the same part of the horizon that you did before to get some type of a standard measurement. To me it was easier to measure with no filter to the top of the airglow. With the green filter I liked to measure the bottom of the airglow.

Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Roger, Jim. We would like to get a readout on your OAMS source pressure, temperature, and your quantity gage.
The OAMS source temperature is 60° and the pressure is a little below 2000.
Roger. What about the quantity?
Quantity is reading out 60 1/2 percent.
Roger. When are one of you going to sleep?
...
Say again.
It will be about 4 ...
You're cutting out.
Gemini 4, hold your switch down a little bit longer. You're cutting out.
Roger.
We are only getting your first word, Jim.
Okay?
I can't say that's okay.
Okay?
Okay. That came through good.
Have you really decided who's going to go to sleep first?
Yes, Ed is.
Ed is. Okay. And about when will he go to sleep?
About another 30 minutes.
Okay. That's fine.
Hey, Jim, did you see that tropical storm off California?
Yes, I did.
It's a full-blown tropical storm they tell me now.
Well, there were a lot of clouds ...
Did you log IFR?
...
You're cutting out again.
Okay. Must be that microphone.
I say, clouds run a third of the way between Hawaii and California.
And you say clouds from about a third of the way from Hawaii to California and what was the last?
And they stop abruptly at the coastline.
Roger. That's stopped abruptly.
Hey, Jim, would you press on your External Temperature again, please.
Does that help any?
Yes, that looks better.
You're still alive.
... wise guy.
Hey, Jim.
Yes.
Christ just told Joke A.
This is a real dilly, isn't it?
I thought it was going to be my turn to tell Joke A.
We will go ahead with B when you can stand it.
... computer on and also give us your Quantity Read Switch OFF.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Would you check your main batteries and give us a GO or NO-GO on your mains? For a ... or the 48th.
Roger.
Gemini 4, be advised that Pilot can scrub his Biomed data pass over Hawaii, the next Rev.
Gemini 4. Roger.
Roger. Gemini, what was your status for GO NO-GO, 48?
... 48.
Roger.
Just a second. I'll give you the battery status.
Roger.
Be advised, you can turn your computer and Quantity Read Switch OFF.
I have just updated your computer with a new 36-4 load. I have your back-up quantities. Would you prepare to copy?
Roger, stand by just a moment.
Gemini 4, with the battery data.
Go ahead.
Roger. The adapter batteries are all fine, staying at 24, the main battery are -- just a second, the adapter batteries -- the adapter batteries are 2 to 2 1/2 at 24. The main batteries at 9 and 22 1/2.
Roger.
Roger. Are you prepared to copy your 36-4 backup guidance quantities?

Roger.
Could you give me a G.m.t. time hack, please?
Roger, on my mark it will be 22 hours 07 minutes - about a minute.
We still have indications that your AC power is ON.
Roger, I think it is.
Be advised, also, that we have some D-9, Delta 9, Experiment data for you.
Roger, stand by until I get my time hack.
We're going to have an LOS, I believe. I'll let Hawaii give you a G.m.t. time hack. I think we'll have LOS before you can copy.
... you give me the hack.
Okay, about 10 seconds. 3, 2, 1.
MARK! 22 hours 07 00.
I got the mark.
Okay, D-9. Are you prepared to copy?

Gemini 4, this is Hawaii transmitting in the blind. We have information on your Pegasus time: 01 39 00. Yaw -- 0°, pitch up -- 60°, slightly to your right, heads up 300 nautical miles. I repeat again. In the blind, Hawaii transmitting, 01 39 00, Pegasus, Yaw -- 0°, pitch up -- 60°, slightly to your right, heads up, 300 nautical miles.
MSC-2 and -3 were placed OFF at 02:28.
What time?
Okay, 02:25. Correct that 28 to 02:25.
Those are the Himalayas, I'm quite sure, having seen Gordo's picture that he took. It was such a good one. I believe we took -- Oh, oh, we took a sunset picture of the ...
Right.
Jim just saw another satellite. He hasn't described it to us yet as he did the other one. This was at 14:37. That wasn't right. Correct that to 02:37 or 38.
This one was a lot farther away than the one intended for us. He tried to get a picture of it.
Did you get a picture?
Yes, he took a picture of it with the 4-power telescopic lens.
It came by on my side. The sun was smack dab in the window. I couldn't see anything.
Well, I saw a white ball. Jim says this is about what it looked like. Kind of a white ball. I saw part of the white ball.
Gemini 4, CSQ CAP COM. Would you turn your computer ON for a 48-1 preretro update -
Gemini 4, with the computer on.
Say again, Gemini 4. You're broken.

Roger. Understand, ... have surpassed total elapsed time of Manned Space Flights of the United States.
Roger.
...
Roger.
This is Gemini 4 again. I saw another satellite up there.
Roger, go ahead.
We saw another satellite about - it was 02:38 when I saw the thing and it was much farther away than the other one that I saw. I tried taking a picture of it. I think I might have it on our 200-mm lens.
Roger, good show.
I'm afraid this one was way too far away to show any detail.
Roger.
Roger. I'm going to send you a Gemini load. Would you watch your DCS light for reception this time?
Did you get a light?
Roger. We got a light. It was turned down last time; guess that's why I didn't see it.
Be advised you have a new 48-1 TR time and load. I have your backup guidance quantities. Are you prepared to copy?
After the 48-1 copy, also have a block of CLA and PLA data.

Roger. Stand by one.
Gemini 4, this is Houston. That's the Sextant D-9. Rev 41. Over.
You're breaking up.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. That's D-9, Run no. 2, Run no. 2. Over.
Gemini 4, this is Houston. I say again, Run no. 2, Run no. 2.
Roger, understand. Run no. 2.
Roger, that's all.
Am I to understand that we are authorized to use fuel on that one?
That's affirmative. Use fuel.
...
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead, RKV. Gemini 4.
Roger, Gemini 4. I have an Apollo update plus several other updates for you. Are you prepared to copy?
Roger, we will be in the middle of Experiment D-9 right now. Can you hold them or ... late transmissions on the time schedule?
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM. RKV is standing by. If you get through with your D-9 Experiment in time, give me a call. We have about 5 1/2 minutes left of this pass.
Roger. I don't anticipate that I'll be done in time.
Roger, we're standing by.
Roger, thank you.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead, Houston. This is Gemini 4.
Roger, Gemini 4. I have an orbital map update. Are you ready to copy?
Stand by one, please.
Go ahead.
Roger. On Rev 42, longitude 31° West, G.m.t. 06 40 35.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4. Say again, please. You were blocked out.
Roger. Rev 42, longitude 31° West, G.m.t. 06 40 35.
Roger, I got the update and be advised I've got an RCS heater light and I presently have my RCS heaters ON at this time.
GT-4, Houston CAP COM. Say again, please.
I got a RCS heater light on the dark side of this pass, and I put the RCS heaters ON.
Very good, Edward.
Roger, Gemini 4. We got that. And also at elapsed time of about 64:30 in your Flight Plan, scratch "power up spacecraft for translation." Over.
Roger, understand, "Power up for translation."
That's affirmative.
Be advised that over ... is in the A-ring and not in the B-ring.
Roger, we got that, the A-ring.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead, RKV. Gemini 4.
Roger. I have an Apollo Landmark update for you. This is for Run - Run 6, Sequence 15, Rev 42. The G.m.t. time will be for 8 hours, 31 minutes, yaw 15°, pitch 30. You can use your OAMS if necessary. Do you copy?
Roger-dodger. Apollo Landmark Run 6 08 31, yaw 15, pitch 30, and fuel no problem
That's affirmative. Flight would also like to know what the position of your RCS heater switch is, and the status of the indicator lights.
Roger. I've been having a cycling on and off of the requirements of the RCS heater. The first one was at 06:47, and I put the heater on and the light was extinguished at 06:54. That was ring A. Ring B came on at 06 - 07:05. It took 5 minutes to extinguish it. Ring B came on at 07:20, and it also took 5 minutes to extinguish it. Ring B came on at 07:37 and it took 5 minutes, and Ring A came on at 07:50, and it took 5 minutes. They look like pretty good readings. The temperature on the - the temperatures are down around 67°.
Roger. Very good. And Flight also advised that they would like to have you give their reports like this to each site each time this is turned on to keep with the power usage curve.
Roger. I thought you would. Be advised also, I set up a slow rotation so that when I get out on the daylight side I can get a ...
Roger. It sounds like a real good idea. You have a medical pass over the Canary Islands on the pilot. The Type 1 on this next rev, and that will be approximately G.m.t. of 08:17.
Roger. Understand a Type 1 Medical Pass at 08:17.
Roger. That's affirmative.
Okay, ... look good here on the ground on you, and that's about all we have for this pass. We'll stand by if you have anything else.
Roger. Everything is good up here.
The Command Pilot is still sleeping. He'11 be getting up in about 30 to 40 minutes.
Gemini 4. Flight would like to get a confirmation that this is Sequence no. 15 for you on this Apollo Landmark.
Roger, it was a Sequence 15.
That's affirmative.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead, Canary.
Roger. Your systems look good. We're ready for your Aero-Med Pass 1. Meet my Surgeon on UHF.
Gemini 4, Canary Surgeon.
Go ahead, Canary. Gemini 4.
Request that Pilot pump up blood pressure cuff.
Cuff is full-scale.
Blood pressure is received. Start exercise on your mark.
MARK!
Cuff is full-scale.
Blood pressure is received. Request your food, water, and rest status.
Roger. I had -- I'm eating at the present time. Meal 2 of the third day. I've had 6 swallows of water. I had 4 good hours of sleep out of the last 5 when I had my sleep cycle.
Very good. Four good hours out of your 5 hours rest cycle.
Affirmative.
Very good. This is Canary Surgeon returning you to Canary CAP COM.
Canary CAP COM. We have nothing more. We'll stand by for you.
Roger. I'm in the process now of an Apollo Landmark.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
RKV, Gemini 4. Go ahead.
Roger, the Surgeon has some questions for you.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. Over.
Go ahead RKV, Gemini 4.
Roger, is this the Command Pilot?
Negative, this is the Pilot.
Is the Command Pilot still sleeping?
He's just getting up. Did you want a medical pass on him?
Negative, no medical pass. I wanted to ask him, if he was awake, his opinion upon this sleep period, and how long he slept.
I am sorry. This is the Command Pilot. I ... There were 5 and 1/2 hours and I would guess that probably at least 4 of it was pretty good sleep.
Roger. You are coming in loud and clear.
Two other questions -- did you use the waste collection system at all during the flight?
Boy, did we ever. We each used the defecation system one time and the urine system about four or five times, I guess.
Roger. A question on medication. Have you taken any medication?
Negative. No medication, Surgeon.
Roger. And the Pilot is now scheduled for a sleep period. When do you plan to go to sleep, Ed?
RKV Surgeon, Gemini 4.
Roger, Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. One other question.
Roger, go ahead.
The Pilot is scheduled for a sleep period. When do you plan to sleep?
Gemini 4, RKV Surgeon. The question is when does the Pilot plan to sleep? Over.
Roger. We're discussing that, either right away or right after the MSC-10 Experiment which will be right about ... I think it'll probably be an hour and a half.
Roger.
I have no other questions, CAP COM.
We're about to have LOS. That's it from here.
I just have a comment to make about the -- is the tape running over there? Is the light on?
I've got this taping.
Okay, want to comment on our food. So far every orange juice bag, every bag that I have put water into that has had orange juice in it in any form, or pineapple, or straight orange juice, has had a leaky water valve. Now, I've had only one other drippy bag so far, and we're already about 60 something hours into the the flight. But every single orange juice bag has had a leak in it. And Ed just came up with another leaky orange juice bag for himself. But this is Ed's first one.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Roger, this is Gemini 4.
Roger, Jim. I've got some significant weather for your S-6 Experiment. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston. I have some weather for your S-6 Experiment. Can you copy? Over.
Roger Houston, Gemini 4. I understand you've got some weather for us for S-6. You're pretty broken up, I didn't get your message.
Roger, Gemini 4. Weather for S-6. Look for any clouds in lee of the Canaries and Madeira Island for oblique photographs. Location approximately 200 miles south and 300 miles north of spacecraft position at time 09 51 00 for a total of 5 minutes, 05 minutes. It's highly desirable to get photographs of these clouds on successive passes over the same area.
Roger. Understand you want us to look at some eddy clouds in the lee of the Canaries at 09:51. Is that correct?
That's affirm. You got it, Jim, and would you turn your Quantity Read Switch ON for about 10 seconds?
Roger. Do we have some fuel to take these pictures?
That's affirm. Also Jim, for information, we tentatively plan on powering up the Platform at 67:40 elapsed time. Thats 67+40 elapsed time for approximately 2 hours. We'll have a revised Flight Plan for you shortly.
Okay, we'll power up the platform at 07:40.
Yeah.
What it'll amount to, we'll follow the Flight Plan, but we'll have to revise it in terms of successive order, some of the items.
Okay.
Did you say the direction we're supposed to look for these eddy clouds?
Roger. You can turn your Quantity Read OFF now. Look for eddy clouds around the Canaries and Madeira Island. Location approximately 200 miles south and 300 miles north of spececraft position.
That time is just about the time of Canary's acquisition.
Roger. But I know what you are talking about. Roger.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston. Can you give us any idea of whether you've got some of your gear stored. We're concerned about CG. Over.
It looks like we're going to end up with ECM on the floor, and we're going to have the cable in Ed's lap. And we're going to have the gun stowed in the center food box where it was. We're going to have the film in the center food box. We're going to have the camera equipment in the side food box.
Roger. We got it.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead, Canary.
Roger. Your systems still look good. I have 10 retro updates for you. Let me know when you're ready to copy.
Okay, we're ready.
Roger. 45-1 101. 2+08. 12 37 50. 5+36. 10+33. 46-1 114. 2+25 14 12 47. 4+05. 9+33. 47-1 Fore and aft firing thrusters. 08 and 120. 0+14 and 2+30. 15 46 36. 3+17. 8+37. 48-1 Fore and aft thrusters. 24 and 120. 0+40 and 230, correction 2+30. 17 20 19. 2+42. 8+43. 49-4 111. 2+21. 20 06 48. 4+11. 9+46. 44 BRAVO Fore and aft firing thrusters 14 and 120. 0+24 and 2+30. 11 55 47. 11+10 ... 5 120. 2+30. 13 29 13. 11+42. 46 BRAVO 94. 1. 15 08 39. 11+30. 47 BRAVO 85. 1+48. 16 42 35. 10+36. 48 BRAVO 82. 1+45. 18 13 36. 10+05. And that's all. Did you copy?
Affirmative, I copied.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead, Canary.
Are your RCS heaters on?
Negative, they are not.
Roger.
Canary, Gemini 4.
Go ahead.
Gemini 4, Canary. Go ahead.
All right. 08:23 to 08:33 and 08:14 to 08:20.
Say again the last.
08:14 to 08:20.
Roger. Copy on 08:23 to 08:33 and 08:14 to 08:20.
I've taken a picture, a very good picture, of the Cairo airport from the track over the station.
I think that on this tracking task, using the world map and the small map of the Cairo-Alexandria area, we were able to pick up the airport at Cairo. However, I didn't see the airport until we were about 10° from it, I would guess, or 15°. Is that when you saw it?
Yeah.
Okay, so that makes -
That next time.
Okay, that happened last time -
In Texas.
Yeah. Now that we know where (illegible) will be a lot easier the next time around. The first time we looked for Cairo - for Cairo and Alexandria, we found that (illegible) a while. I never did really see the airfield. I just saw the area. I guessed if I pointed the camera right, I'd have a picture of Cairo. But this time I actually picked up the airfield. Same thing with Alexandria. I think if you are going to take a picture of something like that, it might be worthwhile to pass over it one time, take a good look at it and take the pictures next time around.
The rubber - the rubber outside the prophylactic on the exerciser broke.
T/M solid at Carnarvon.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Hello Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Roger. You're looking good here on the ground. How are you up there?
Everything is fine.
Okay, I've got a little info for you. Got a pencil and paper?
Stand by just a second.
Okay. Go ahead.
They would like for you to power up and aline your platform at 10 50 00. They would also like for you to turn on Experiment MSC-1 at that time.
Okay, MSC-1 ON at 10:50 and I'm to power up and aline the platform at that time.
Roger. And you're to go ahead with your MSC-10. That's MSC-10 if it doesn't interfere with platform alinement.
Okay, we're supposed to do MSC-10 at that time.
Carnarvan, I'm not reading you. Was I supposed to do MSC no. 1 and MSC no. 10, or just MSC-10?
MSC-1 will go ON at that time, and you're to do MSC-10 if it doesn't interfere.
Roger, okay. We'll do that.
Okay. I don't have a new update time. Use the original times on the Flight Plan for MSC-10.
Say again.
Use your Flight Plan times for MSC-10. No new update.
Roger.
Okay.
Okay.
Is your buddy asleep?
Yes, he's starting to doze off. I am going to have to wake him up before we can do MSC-10 together.
Okay. Stand by. Let me make sure they want to do that.
Okay, they want you to wake him up to help you with MSC-1 when you need to.
Roger. I will.
Roger.
They will give you a Flight Plan update over the States.
Roger. Understand we will get a Flight plan update over the States. It looks like we're going to be pretty busy up there at that time. We'll be alining the platform and doing MSC-10 at the same time.
Okay, I'll tell them not to bother you too much.
Okay, we've got to turn your platform ON.
Say again.
You turned your platform ON, didn't you?
I put my ACME ... I'm just going to straighten the spacecraft up and get it turned right-side-up here.
Okay, very good.
We just started up the platform, it will take it about 30 minutes to come up before we can start alining it.
Roger. Understand.
Okay.
We're going to start the power at 10:50.
Very good.
Gemini 4, again. I see the same sort of curve of lights, like the northern lights except they are below us, and I saw them another time, they were great big long lines. Looks like they run about parallel to the direction of our flight path and they extend from just below the airglow in the earth's horizon, up a little bit past the top of the airglow. The same thing I saw the other night except that it's not quite as bright as it was then.
It reinforced the airglow.
That's right. It looks like it reinforced the air glow.
Reinforced the air glow more down to the bottom.
Got IGS power on the line and platform to CAGE SEF at Houston.
The ... thruster went on at 10:52. 10:51.
MARK!
I just saw a falling star trail down not too far in front of us and it burned out considerably below us. The whole tail -- was quite long, which was actually below our level. It burned up considerably below us.
Yes.
We are starting the MSC Experiment at 11:04.
If we had an event timer track Experiment at 11:04.
Don't think we can.
Get it at Carnarvon. We can't get out and fire them normally ... Glad we got it at the right time anyway.
Yeah.
Okay. Now it looks like - Okay, the weather on the horizon -- clouds, clouds on the horizon on the left hand side of the picture, I can see the clouds right up to about the middle, and at the middle it looks like they break off, and then there's just some scattered high stuff - it looks like this stuff on the left is pretty solid.
Been going on 2 minutes.
I've got one ...
...
Are 2 minutes up? What time do you have?
Right now I have 12:30.
12:30?
Yes.
38, 39, 40.
Look at that star rising up there -- see it? Or is that another one of our satellites?
Where?
See it right in front of us, that bright star ...
No.
That looks almost like a normal sunrise, doesn't it?
That's what it is.
Well, you know, that's not what you expected it to be. I -- I don't have the lens on right.
It's coming up on 4 minutes now.
I've got 3:40. Lens is on right.
Well, it sort of slipped down.
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
That would have been something, wouldn't it?
Yes.
Let's do this one more time.
I'll go ahead and get this off -- What the heck?
Wish we had some lights in here.
Well, that's what they want, don't they? Carry it out like he said. I remember he said ...
Coming up on the time.
Yes.
MARK!
Got that on the onboard voice tape?
Yes.
753 at 09 - 11:09 - Sun right on the horizon. We haven't had much success with the photo-event indicator on the Hasselblad. We have it. Puts the shutters in the - what do they call that thing? The shutter doesn't fall properly ...
The shutter doesn't go down and the doors, or whatever they call them, don't open again. That's the third set, about. We're taking them at exactly 5 minute intervals from the first one, and they're all coming out.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. This is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4. Houston CAP COM. Over.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4. Read you loud and clear.
Roger, read you loud and clear. I have a Flight Plan update and if you're too busy to copy, we'll just be standing by.
Okay, just another minute or two here.
11:04, 11:09, 11:14.
11:04, 11:09, 11:14.
Houston, Gemini 4 here. Go ahead with what you have.
Roger, Jim. Would you prefer these in Greenwich Mean Time or in Elapsed Time? Over.
Just give me the G.m.t.'s.
Roger. Okay, G.m.t. 11 54 00 Horizon Scanner Sunset Check.
Stand by just a minute.
Roger, standing by.
Platform Attitude Malfunction light came on at 11:15 - 11:15.
The attitude of the sun was about 40° above the nose. Four series were taken and -
Okay, go ahead with the rest of your G.m.t.'s.
Roger. Time 12 15 00 Horizon Scanner Moonset Check.
Okay. 12 15 Horizon Scanner Moonset Check
Roger. You got the previous one, 14 54 00 Horizon Scanner Sunset Check?
It was 11 54, wasn't it?
Roger. The first one was 11:54, and the second one was 12:15.
Roger. I've got that.
Okay, the next one is 12 22 00 Apollo Yaw Orientation Night Check.
Okay, 12:22 Apollo Yaw Orientation Night Check.
Roger, 12 58 00 Horizon Scanner Thruster Check.
Okay, 12:58 Horizon Scanner Thruster Check.
Roger. 12 59 00 Horizon Scanner Track Check.
Roger. Horizon Scanner Track Check at 12:59.
Roger, and at 13 14 00 one Attitude Thruster Check.
Say again 13:14.
Roger, that's One Attitude Thruster Check.
Did you get that last one, Jim?
Gemini 4, this is Houston.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Roger, did you get that One Attitude Thruster Check?
Houston, Gemini 4. I'm not getting that 13:14 message.
Roger, we'll get the rest to you at Canaries.
Roger.
At this time the event indicator worked all right. Looks like I got it adjusted so I can take the pictures with it, so the series from now on will be marked on the event.
Gemini 4, Houston. Could you give us the approximate time you commenced platform alinement?
The timer, I think, hangs up to magazine. Somehow, I don't know -- for the 6 series we're going back and try the event indicator.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM
Go ahead, Canary. Gemini 4.
Roger, I have the rest of your Flight Plan changes.
Okay, go ahead.
Roger. At G.m.t. 13 14 00 One Attitude Thruster Check.
Okay.
At G.m.t. 13 20 00 power down Platform and deactivate MSC-1.
Roger. 12:20 power down platform and deactivate MSC-1.
Roger. We would like to know the time you commenced your platform alinement.
Roger. I powered the platform up at 11:50 as scheduled, and I haven't got it alined yet. I got the Attitude Malfunction Light on at 11:15. I still have not started caging.
Roger. Understand. Houston advises to take it easy on your fuel. They estimate 10 lbs of propellant for these checks.
Roger, I'll go easy on it. We've been in Pulse Mode ever since we took off.
Roger. I also have Rev 44 map update for you.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. 121° West at G.m.t. 12 35 00.
Roger. 121 West at 12:35.
That's affirmative.
Everything looks good from here.
Okay, same here.
We're taking the 6 set here. Photographs at 11:25.
You rolling it enough?
Supposed to go right into darkness, isn't it?
Yes ... those guys told me to aline that platform ... you wait, I'll bet we don't get that platform up in time ...
You know what we're supposed to be looking for on the sunset?
I'm ... right now.
How can you do this and take pictures?
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Roger. Looking good here on the ground. How are you doing?
Fine.
Okay. Have you finished up with your horizon scanner on sunset?
Negative, I'm not.
Okay. I'd like you to take a look to see if you can see the lights of Melbourne. That'll be about 8 minutes from now.
Okay. At 00:08?
Ought to be a pretty good time. They should be just a little to the right of you -- just about underneath you -- just slightly down.
Okay. To the north.
Negative, to the south.
To the south. Okay.
I don't know whether you would see it. It's raining here real bad. I don't know whether the weather is clear over Melbourne or not.
Okay. Yes, everytime I go over Australia all I ever see is thunderstorms.
Had 3 inches today.
Wow!
They need it.
Did you get it all today?
Say again.
I got the platform all powered up, and it seems to be working properly.
Very good.
Yes, I thought so, too.
How about pushing down on your external lead again.
Okay. Looks like it fixed the problem
Very good.
Those things are starting to hedge a little.
Say again.
I say, those things are starting to hedge a little.
How long did it take you to warm up the platform?
... I turned it on at 11:50 and at 12:15 I got the Attitude Mal Light which indicated that it was warmed up.
Okay. 25 minutes. Thank you.
Roger. I didn't start alining until about 30 after.
And after I started alining it, I started with a pretty bad reference, because we were trying to get this MSC-10 thing done. It took about 15 to 17 minutes to get it to aline properly.
Roger. Understand.
Looks like your cohort woke up?
Yes, we're pretty busy here. He took a little one ... He only got better for about 15 minutes.
Wasn't worth it.
No, he went around to put on our pajamas. So I guess it wasn't too much trouble.
Right.
Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Go ahead.
I see some lights shining on the clouds down below me at this time.
All right. That should be Melbourne.
Okay. Very good. Tell them I thank them for lighting the night for me.
Okay, very good. They'll appreciate that.
Tell them the next time though, to get those clouds out of the way so I can see the city and not just the clouds.
That's the same way I feel, I'm all miffed.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini 4. Go ahead.
Roger. How are you coming on your Horizon Checks? Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Roger, Gemini 4. How are your Horizon Checks coming?
We're coming on pretty well. We've got - the Horizon Scan Thruster and the Track Check left to do.
Roger. I would like to remind you that the Horizon Scan Thruster Check should not be commenced until you can confirm Canary's AOS. Canaries will give you a call at AOS. Over.
Roger. Understand. We will wait for Canary's AOS.
Roger. And we're interested in the cabin humidity. Is there any noticeable water in the cabin? Over.
Negative. We were just talking about that a few minutes ago. The humidity is staying low, about 60 to 63 percent, and there is no noticeable moisture. We've been doing a great deal of operations with face-plates open and gloves off.
Understand. Face-plates open and gloves off.
Affirmative.
Roger. We would like to know how much colored film remains. Just an estimate - for the Hasselblad camera and the 16-mm camera. Over.
Broke up. Say again.
Roger. We're interested in an estimate of how much unexposed colored film you have for the Hasselblad and the 16-mm cameras.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead, this is Gemini 4.
Roger. Can you give us an estimate of how much colored film you have remaining for the Hasselblad and 16-mm cameras?
Roger. We have one magazine of Hasselblad film left and a little under two magazines of 16-mm left.
Roger. Understand. You two ready to come home yet?
Say again.
Are you two ready to come home yet?
I'm sure getting tired of looking at his ugly face. He needs a shave.
We're getting tired of hearing that silly voice, too, McDivitt.
Hello, Frankie.
How are you doing?
Well, I'm waiting until 12:58 so I can fire my thrusters again.
Ha! Ha! This is the most fun you've had in 2 days, I'll bet.
Yes, it's the first time I've fired the thrusters in 2 days.
Have at it, flight-time hogs!
Too bad this isn't next month; I have my requirements in already.
Hey, you know I knew that White was a time hog, Jim, but I always thought you were a 55-minute mission man.
You're making me stay up here until we burn out the fuel.
Right.
I don't ever land with them full.
... and we shoot GCA's when we come back.
Right. Everything's just real good down here. I saw both of your wives yesterday. Everything's in good shape.
Okay.
We're thinking of extending the mission about a week.
Better send some more food!
Okay. Frank said he would be on his way up as soon as he can make it.
Houston, Gemini 4. Where am I?
Say again, Gemini 4.
I say, where am I?
You don't know? It looks like you're just about southeast of the tip of Florida. Probably about over Cuba.
I got it. I thought it was an island - turned out it was Florida.
Gemini 4, can you give us a reading on OAMS source pressure, temperature, and quantity?.
Roger. The quantity reads 55 percent, but it keeps going up and down. I think that's a pretty good average number right now.
The OAMS source temperature is 70, pressure is 1900.
Roger. We got 55 percent, 70, and 1900.
That's affirmative.
Gemini 4, this is Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. It looks like you've used about 15 pounds at a first guess -- OAMS.
I've used how much?
A first cut at it, Jim, looks like about 15 pounds so far.
I've used 15 out of 10?
Yes, 15 out of 10 available for these checks.
No, we haven't used that much at all.
Gemini, this is Houston. That's just a rough guess on the OAMS usage. We'll get a better cut at it after Canaries. You're still looking good.
Okay. I got a question. This check that we are supposed to perform at 13:14 which is a One Attitude Thruster Check. Is that the Attitude Thruster Failure Check?
Okay. Stand by one.
That's affirmative, Jim. That's a One Attitude Thruster Failure Check.
Okay.
Gemini 4, this is Houston. You really sound great, and we'll see you later tonight.
Okee-dokee.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Canary, Gemini 4. Do you read?
Roger. We have T/M Acquisition on you now.
Okay. I'll go ahead with that thruster check.
All set?
Roger.
Okay. We didn't get any break lock on that.
Say again.
We completed the Thrusting Fire Scanner Check, and we didn't get any break lock on the scanner.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini4.
All right. How're you doing?
Looking good down here. How are you looking up there?
Gemini 4, Carnarvon. How do you read?
Very good, Carnarvon. How do you read?
Loud and clear. How are you going?
Fine. How are you doing?
A little tired. You're looking real good down here.
Of course. Everything going along okay up here. Be advised we turned off our computer and powered down the IGS at 13:20.
Roger, did you have our computer on ... checks?
Yes, we did.
Okay, very good. I'll make a Medical Pass Type 1 on the Pilot at Texas at 14 13 15.
Say, listen. Ed hasn't been to sleep yet. He's just about to go to sleep and I think it would be better for him to go to sleep than to have a Medical Data Pass. How about a medical pass on him right now?
How about putting the oral temp probe in his mouth and get on pumping up that gage on that blood pressure?
Command Pilot, Carnarvon.
Go ahead.
Did you check any MDIU quantities while the computer was powered up?
No, we didn't.
All right.
Cuff is full-scale, coming down, let it down. Okay, we got a valid blood pressure.
Okay.
Stand by for Surgeon.
This is the Carnarvon Surgeon. Take your exercise on your mark.
MARK!
The blood pressure looks good, Pilot.
Okay.
Could we have some more information on your food and water?
Is the temperature good?
Carnarvon Surgeon, is the temperature okay?
Affirmative, you can take the probe out.
The Pilot is on the second meal of the third day at the present time and had 7 swallows of water since the last report.
Okay, have you had a chance to sleep at all since your last Aero-Med Pass?
No, I don't believe so.
Okay, that is all we need at this time -
... another 15-minute nap, as a matter of fact.
What was that again?
I caught about a 15-minute nap but have been pretty happy for the last couple of hours.
You received more rest in the last pass or so; we noticed that, but unfortunately, we had to wake you up.
Right, ... about 15 minutes.
Okay, Carnarvon Surgeon out.
All right.
... sleep right now ... Power down a little bit.
Okay ... we have got that.
Okay, see you next time around.
I'll be asleep.
... Gemini 4.
Stand by one.
We're pointing straight down.
Say again.
We're pointing straight down.
Roger. Got that.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM Over.
Go ahead. This is Gemini 4.
Roger, Gemini 4. I'd like to advise you, you'll have a critical tape dump over Canaveral in approximately 4 minutes.
What was that?
Roger, a critical tape dump over Canaveral in about 4 minutes.
Hey, Gemini 4. We'd like your Quantity Read Switch ON and I'll tell you when to turn it OFF.
Roger, it's on. Do you want me to right-side-up when I pass over Canaveral?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
How are you doing this morning, Jim?
... just dandy!
Doing great.
...
Affirmative.
Hello there, how are you?
Just fine. After a long night's sleep!
Affirmative. We've had a lot of short night's sleep.
I'm getting along fine, ...
You're doing a great job. Jim, we took a hack on your accelerometer bias down here and it -- while your platform was powered up -- and it looks good to us.
Okay, thank you.
Roger, and I'd like to advise you that any MSC-10 films that you have left over, you can use for targets of opportunity at your own option.
Okay, Ed's got it ... I don't think we can get anything exciting ...
Rog, and concerning S-5 and S-6 you'll have some more weather over the Canaries and the pass over Africa on this Rev. Looks good for S-6.
Okay, I never did see any clouds down on the Canaries last time.
Roger, they're still supposed to be there.
Okay, I'll look again. I got to get my partner to go to bed. But he doesn't seem to be able to make the grade.
I didn't read you that time, Jim. Say again.
I said, I'm still trying to get my partner here to go to bed but he doesn't seem to be able to make it.
Understand you're still trying to get your partner to sleep. Is that right?
That's right.
Okay.
You can turn your Quantity Read back off.
... this is Gemini 4.
... for about 3 or 4 hours.
Okay.
Carnarvon says they have been having an awful lot of rain. Do you think that could be what's bothering you?
What time will we get to the Canaries?
Yes, I want to know what time we should start looking for any clouds again.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Canary, Gemini 4.
Roger, we have you still powered ...
You have what?
We have you ...
That's affirmative. I'm looking for some blood ... around here.
Roger.
You know where they are? I don't seem to be able to find them.
That's northeast of it.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead.
Flight says he doesn't worry about the ACME power.
Okay, I'll turn it off as soon as I get over Africa. I don't see those clouds floating around any place.
Roger.
I'm approaching Africa. I'm going to turn it off now.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Hello Carnarvon, hello Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
... Gemini 4, Carnarvon. Loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear.
Okay, looking good here on the ground. How are you doing?
We're doing fine. The Pilot went to sleep about half an hour ago and he'll be sleeping probably for another 5 or 6 hours.
Okay, we got a couple of things for you that we want you to do.
Okay.
Guaymas acquisition time 15 44 55.
Stand by, let me find my data book.
Okay, reach up and grab it.
Okay, I was sitting on it. Go ahead.
All right. At 15 44 55, that's Guaymas acquisition, they want you to switch your Real Time T/M to the REAL TIME and ACQ AID position.
Roger. Was that 14:55?
Negative. 15 44 55.
Okay, 15 44 55. My T/M switch to REAL TIME and ACQUISITION.
Right. Three minutes prior to that they want you to put your oral temp probe in your mouth. They want a Type 1 Medical Pass over Guaymas.
Okay. Type 1 over Guaymas.
Okay.
They told me they wanted me right-side-up when I went over you. Was that next time or this time?
It must have been for the next time. Hold on. I'll see what they are talking about.
Okay. I'm pointing down at the ground again ...
I have my T/M ...
Okay, we have good T/M. Hold up a second. I want to talk to Flight.
Okay ... with T/M.
Okay. We are in good shape now, Gemini.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM. Will you place your Telemetry Switch to REAL TIME and ACQ AID?
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM. We have completed your oral temp.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM. We have completed your oral temp.
Gemini 4, your cuff is full-scale.
Gemini 4, your blood pressure is received. Start exercise on your mark.
Gemini 4, Guaymas Surgeon. Do you read?
Roger. Do you read?
Roger, Gemini 4. Start your exercise on your mark. We have received your blood pressure.
Roger.
MARK!
Your cuff is full-scale.
Gemini 4, your blood pressure is received. We are standing by for your first water and sleep report.
Roger. I just finished up Meal A of Day 3. Ed has finished one -- the same type, too.
Say again, Gemini.
I had a lot of water. I don't know how many gulps, but I probably had 20 to 30 gulps along with a couple of meals in the last 2 hours.
Roger, understand meal Charlie.
That's right. Now, I've been asleep for about 2 or 3 hours. Ed's going to sleep for about 5 or 6 here, so I probably won't be going again for 6 or 7.
Roger, understand. Surgeon out.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, will you turn your computer on?
Roger, my computer is ON, the COMP LIGHT ought to be on in about 10 seconds.
Okay. Go ahead and turn your T/M switch to COMMAND and your Quantity Read Switch ON, also.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead.
I've got quite a bit of information to pass up to you, Jim. First of all - first is your 48-1 time. Tell me as soon as you are ready to copy.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. 24 ft/sec forward, that's 40 seconds, 120 ft/sec aft, that's 2+32 at 17 20 00. 2+53. 8+55. Continue 48-1 time without burn. 17 14 37. 7+41. 14+29.
Got it.
Okay. Now I've got quite a bit of information to pass up to you here. We would like for the Pilot, who is asleep, to leave his face-plate open and his gloves off. And then we would like for the Pilot that is awake to take off his helmet and gloves and use the light-weight headset for communications if he can. And we would like for you to continue this way up until about 3 hours prior to retrofire. Then, once in orbit, at your convenience, we would like for you to take a wet and dry bulb reading and just at any station give us a report of what it was and what time you took it.
Okay. We have been operating with the face-plate open and gloves off now for about the last 12 hours, but mostly in that situation we kept oversleeping. When we sleep we generally close the visor and put the ... cover to keep the light out of our eyes.
Roger.
The humidity stays down around 50 percent.
Roger. Okay, Jim, we decided that you've got a little bit of fuel left that we can play with here in the Flight Plan. We would like for you to go to the Horizon Scan Mode for the next 8 hours. That's at an elapsed time of about 80:30, and we want you to use the Primary Scanner. We don't want you to do any controlling in yaw, and if the scanner breaks lock, don't control in roll or pitch either. We want to see - if it breaks lock, we would like to see if it will reacquire.
Okay. You want the horizon scanners on for the next 8 hours.
Affirmative.
80 hours elapsed time.
Roger.
Okay, Gus. For flight planning purposes, we haven't been able to do much with D-9, because we haven't been using the fuel for it. We ought to save a little fuel to do that.
Okay. We got no problem. Go ahead and use your D-9. Now, on the Apollo Landmark no. 2, we would like for you to be in attitude for that at 17:19. G.m.t. of 17:19. And the landmark will be 16 miles north of track, and you should be pitched down about minus 30° at that time. And we would like for you to track this as close as possible and to get some pictures using the 16-mm camera with 75-mm lenses with a nominal lens setting.
Roger. Will do.
Do you want me to repeat any of that?
Negative. Apollo no. 2 at 17:19. 16 miles north of track. Pitch is down about 30° and use the 75-mm lenses at that time.
Roger, and really have at it and track it close. Use your reticle.
Okay.
Okay. Your Orbit Nav Runs 9 and 10 do as scheduled in the Flight Plan. Do it just as you previously planned to do it. Just for information, 9 is scheduled at an elapsed time of 75:30 and 10 at 75:50.
Okay. We will do Orbit Nav Runs 9 and 10 as scheduled at 75:30 and 75:50.
Roger. We are going to come up with some more tracking tasks for you, I think, and we want most of them to be done pretty tight.
Okay. Very good.
Okay, I have a map update for you if you want it now.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay. 170° East, G.m.t. is 17 00 00. That's Rev 47.
Okay. 17 East at 17 00 00. Rev 47.
Roger. You can bring your Quantity Read OFF.
And you can bring your computer OFF also.
Gemini 4, Houston. How do you read now?
Loud and clear.
Okay. Did you get all of that? Did you get the Quantity Read OFF and the computer OFF?
Yes. I'm getting them now.
Okay.
Okay, now Flight would like to know if you are going to try sleeping with your helmet off. Try sleeping with your face-plate open, I'm sorry.
I don't know. The sun really gets in your eyes, Gus. I don't think we'll try that. Ed has tried sleeping with his helmet up and then down and right now he just slipped it up. He's having a tough time with the sun. I tried it, and I can't do it.
Okay. Can you just put the shade over anyway?
Yes. He's sleeping with it about half open. How about that?
Okay.
Actually the last 12 hours or more, maybe as much as 24, we haven't been too careful about keeping our face-plate closed and our ... bands up because obviously, the humidity isn't going up.
Yeah. Well, of course, that is what we are trying to do. We are trying to get a good hack on what is happening there. Maybe we don't have a problem like we originally thought.
Yes. I don't think we do. Essentially, Ed hasn't had his face-plate closed for the last 12 hours, and I only had mine closed when I was sleeping.
Okay. Well, go ahead and do what we asked as near as you can and give us those wet and dry bulbs so we can get a good spot on this thing.
Okay. I have been running them right along and our temperatures are running about -- the dry bulbs are running 72 and 75, the wet bulbs between 60 and 64. The relative humidity stands pretty close to around 60 percent.
Very good.
Yes. And there is no visible moisture. And there isn't any moisture around that blotting paper. Unfortunately, you covered up the walls so that I can't take the temperature, but the worst temperature I can find is about 65.
Roger.
Jim, the Flight Surgeon wonders if he can say anything about your eyes. Have you had any problems? Any drying or anything at all?
Yes. Listen, I had a lot of trouble with my eyes at the end of the first day. I wasn't sure I was going to be able to hack it. But they have cleared up now. I think our little problem was taken care of by the suit heat exchanger.
Okay. You don't have any problem at all now with them?
No problem at all. Though it was really bad between about 18 and 36 hours.
Roger, understand. Anything else?
No. We are pretty well.
Very good.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. You look good here on the ground. We are standing by if you have anything you need.
Roger, Carnarvon. This is Gemini 4. We're happy.
Okay, we'll just let you alone and continue on.
Roger, thank you. Hey, Ed ...
Carnarvon, Gemini 4, has it stopped raining yet?
Oh, let me take a look outside ... He's sticking his head out the window - wait a second.
Okay.
It has stopped raining, a little bit wet though -
Very good.
There sure have been some wild thunder clouds over Australia here in the last couple of days.
That's affirmative. We've had about 3 inches of rain today. People around here can really use it for their sheep. This is the dry time of the year.
Roger.
And the bananas, too.
Bananas?
Affirmative. They raise bananas here.
I'm trying to think of a banana and a kangaroo joke but I can't put the two together.
Is your buddy awake?
No, he's sound asleep.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, this is Gemini 4.
Roger, I'd like to give you your 51-4 time.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay, 25 ft/sec forward, 41 sec 120 aft, 2+32. At 23+16+02. 2+42. 8+45. Then without burn 23+10+17. 7+05. 14+17.
Okay, got 'em.
Okay. Will you turn your computer ON?
Jim, did you get your computer ON?
Roger, I just got it ON about a couple of seconds ago.
Okay, fine. Hey, Jim, we've decided not to do an orbit adjust. So you just make one burn prior to retrofire.
Okay. How big is it going to be?
It'll be about 130 ft/sec.
Okay. What's my orbit right now?
Say again.
What's my current orbit?
Stand by, I'll get it for you. This means that we have some extra fuel to play with. So we're in the process now of working in some other tracking tasks, and some other things into your Flight Plan that we'll be passing up to you as you go along.
Very good.
So we're going to do a little bit more controlling.
Your orbit right now is 86.3 by 141.6 Staying up very, very well.
Roger.
Hey, did you do a Main Battery Check on the last orbit?
I don't know if Ed did one or not; I'll do one. Do you want it right now?
Well, can you do it? We can wait a little while until Ed wakes up if you want.
No, he's going to be asleep for awhile. I'll try to do it.
Do you want me to read the news to you, while you're trying to do that?
I tell you what, why don't I wait and get it at Canaries. How about that?
Yes, that's a good idea.
All right, I'll do it while I'm crossing the ocean.
Okay, that's good. Hey, you don't go over the Canaries.
I don't go over the Canaries this time?
No, but you can do it between now and Carnarvon.
Okay.
Okay. Here's Haney's news release. It says in the morning paper that you're not going to go for 5 days. This came up in a press conference last night and in answer to this question Chris said it looked like we had the consumables to make it, but we had no plans to do so.
Roger.
There seems to be a move on in Rome to make Pope John XXIII a saint. Even though it may take a hundred years or so.
Roger.
And the Domed Stadium rental controversy is still going on. Then, there's a nice story about Chris and the Control Center and your flight team and your families in the Chronicle this morning.
Very good.
And then, the last item, the Cards finally beat the Astros yesterday, 4-3. Took them 12 innings to do it. That's about it.
Roger.
The rest of the news is Gemini 4.
Roger. I missed that last part, but I guess it's okay.
Roger. Just about the baseball team.
Okay. How's everything going down at the Control Center?
Working better than anybody had reason to expect.
Really great, Jim.
Hey, Jim --
Gemini 4, CAP COM.
Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Houston Flight.
Gemini 4, Houston Flight.
Hello Houston Flight, Gemini 4.
We're real pleased with the way the Control Center is working down here, Jim. The guys have done a great job and deserve a lot of credit. A tremendous flight!
Roger, thank you. Glad to see it's all working out.
Roger.
Gemini 4, CAP COM. Do you want to turn off your computer?
Roger. Already have, Gus.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Hello Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Okay. You're looking real good here on the ground. How are you doing?
Fine, thank you. Stand by for just a second. I want to write something down.
Okay. Get a long piece of paper. I've got a series of updates for you.
Okay, ...
Okay, I've got my ... but before that I want to tell you that my batteries all checked out over the States. Just after I left the States, I did a Battery Check and they all looked normal.
Okay. Very good. You ready to go?
Go.
50-4 55 forward, 71 aft. 1+31. 1+30. 21 40 33. 3+26. 9+02.
Okay.

Say again the GMTRC.
01 26 56.
Roger. That's 26?
I say it again. 01 26 56.
Roger. 01 26 56.
Roger. They intentionally omitted 51-4. You'll get that later.
Okay.
Did you get them all?
Got them all.
Okay.
You're getting pretty proficient at that.
I've got a lot of wind.
You said it, not me.
I did it again.
We'd like to know if your partner's been sleeping straight through.
I think so. Every once in a while he opens his eyes, but that's the way you sleep up here -- sort of interrupted a lot.
Roger.
Command Pilot, you got your helmet on or off?
I've got my helmet on, but I've got the neck ring unfastened. The light-weight headset's over on Ed's side and I don't want to bother him.
okay.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Go ahead Guaymas, Gemini 4.
Roger. All systems are green. We've got a change time for your D-9 Experiment, Run 4.
Okay. Stand by one.
Go ahead, Guaymas.
Roger. Start at sunset on Rev 50 at 20:51 Zulu.
That's 20:51 Zulu?
That's affirmative.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston, Gemini 4.
Hey, Jim, will you turn your computer ON?
Roger.
Okay. I've got another experiment to pass up to you here.
Okay. Just a minute.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Hey, Ed, you're awake!
Rog.
This concerns the Zodiacal Light Experiment which is going to be on "5", and they want to find out if they're going to get any fogging of the film from the attitude control thrusters. We'd like for you to use your 35-mm Contarex camera, and you can use either black and white film or color. And set it wide open at f/18 with the range set at 8 feet.
Roger.
Then we'd like for you to put the camera against the window so that the -- and hold it so that the nose isn't in the field of view. Then we'd like two sets of photographs. Want you to be in Pulse Mode and have the spacecraft pointed straight down at the earth. This will be -- I'll give you the time to start it. But it will be at the black earth on the night side. And then give one pulse-up pitch - pitch pulse-up and get a picture with the shutters of the camera open in the bulb position. And then as you come up through the horizon, get another picture of -- with pitch-down pulse with another frame of the camera and again with the shutter wide open at that time. And then we want the same type of picture with pulse-up with the horizon view and with the black earth in view and a picture with pulse-down with the horizon view and the black earth in view.
Roger. Understand a pulse-up and pulse-down with the bulb position on the 35-mm black and white or color set at f/18 at 8 feet.
That's affirmative.
Okay. Will do.
Okay. We recommend you do it on Rev 51, starting at about 21:40 G.m.t.
Roger. Rev 51 at about 21:40.
Roger. You can turn your computer OFF now. We just checked your loading and it's all okay.
Say, Gus. I've got a question. This D-9 Experiment. Is that an Apollo on no. 4 or is that the other Air Force Run no. 4?
It's an Air Force Run.
Okay. When are we going to do the Apollo Run 4? That one where we take all those stars.
Didn't you do it?
Didn't you do the Apollo one?
No, we haven't done that one yet.
Okay, we'll schedule it in for you.
Okay.
Okay, Jim. Would you press on your external lead. Hey, and we have an indication that you're using about 2 ounces more than we think you should. We're wondering what is the position of your suitband, or do you have something else on that we don't know about?
Yes, we have the suit-bands at 2. We'll turn them back to 2.
That's okay.
Hey, I still have my Malfunction Light and my Computer Light on, but the switch OFF.
We show a computer ON and no Malfunction Light. What's your status now with the computer?
... Prelaunch and some ... Mode.
Well, what mode were you in when you got your Mal Light?
What?
Well, what mode are you in on your computer now?
I just went from Prelaunch to Catch-Up. That turned the Comp light OFF. Let's see if it comes back on now. Okay. It's back on. Now we'll turn the whole computer OFF and see what happens.
I still get the Computer Running Light when I've got the switch OFF.
You still have the Computer Running Light with the switch OFF?
That's affirmative.
Hey ...
What?
Hey, we still show that the computer is on.
You say that you still show that the computer is on?
That's what we show here.
Okay.
Cycle it one time, Jim.
Yes, I cycled it a bunch of times already.
Say again.
Yes. Hey, listen. Can you tell what mode I'm in now down there?
Affirmative.
Okay, I'm going to go to Catch-Up and see if it switches over there.
It's in Catch-Up.
Did it switch on?
Yes, it sure did.
All right, switch it back ON.
Grissom.
Go ahead, Jim.
What mode am I in now?
You're in Catch-Up.
Is that what it shows down there?
It shows you're in Catch-Up and ON. That's correct?
Okay, I must have -- my ON/OFF Switch must have failed in the ON position.
Yes. Hey, Gus!
Go ahead.
Why don't I just turn the IGS power OFF, let it go back to Prelaunch. Then just turn the IGS power OFF.
Just stand by on it a minute, Jim.
Did you get that?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead CAP COM, Gemini 4.
Leave your computer the way it is for a few minutes. Okay?
Okay. I'll leave it OFF - switch OFF, in Prelaunch, with the Computer light burning. Actually, the computer's on, I guess.
Roger. We've got all the experts going through the books here.
Okay.
Hey, Jim. Did you have your HF ON when you passed over Ascension on the last orbit?
No, I didn't have my HF ON, but I was reading somebody on UHF.
Yes, they gave you a call.
I answered on UHF, but I never got a response.
Okay, fine.
Hey, we're still thinking down here.
Gemini 4, you still reading?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, if you read, turn your IGS OFF.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM If you read, turn your IGS OFF.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM transmitting in the blind. We'd like for you to leave your computer running, Computer Switch ON, and your AC Power Switch to ACME.
Hello Gemini 4, Cape COM TECH. Do you read? Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. We'd like you to leave your Computer Switch ON, your AC Power Switch in ACME.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Leave your Computer Switch ON and your AC Power Switch in ACME.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. If you're transmitting, we're not receiving, but we'd like for you to leave your Computer Switch ON, your AC Power Switch in ACME.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. We'd like for you to leave your Computer Switch ON, your AC power supply in ACME.
... Gemini 4, say again please.
Gemini, Houston CAP COM here. Say again.
... Gemini, Houston. Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. We would like for you to leave your Computer Switch ON and your AC Power Switch in ACME. Do you read?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Leave your Computer Switch ON and your AC Power Switch in ACME.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Hello Carnarvon, Gemini 4. How are you?
Roger. Is your Computer Switch in the ON position, your AC Power Switch in the ACME position?
You want my Computer Switch to ON and the AC on ACME. Is that right?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
What position are you in?
I was in Computer Switch ON and AC power to IGS.
Roger, understand. What mode were you in?
What computer mode were you in?
Carnarvon, Gemini 4. I'm in Prelaunch. I have my Computer ON/OFF Switch to OFF. The computer is still running. I have my Power Switch on IGS.
Okay.
Tell me again what happened when you went to OFF position.
Carnarvon, how do you read Gemini 4?
Read you loud and clear. How me?
Go ahead Gemini 4. Read you loud and clear.
Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon. Go.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Hello Carnarvon, hello Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Carnarvon, Gemini 4. Do you read?
Roger. Loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear.
Okay. Tell me briefly what happened when you went to the OFF position over the mainland.
Roger. I went to the OFF position and nothing happened.
Did you get a Malfunction Light?
What?
Did you get a Malfunction Light?
No, I didn't. I got a Malfunction Light when I turned the AC power from IGS to ACME.
Roger, understand.
... put it on ACME, the Computer Light keeps going on and off and once in a while the Malfunction Light is ...
Gemini 4, Carnarvon. How do you read?
Gemini 4, CSQ CAP COM. Do you have a Computer Malfunction Light?
CSQ, Gemini 4.
Roger. Do you have a Computer Malfunction Light on now?
Negative, but I've sure got a funny combination of switches. I've got the ACME power on, I've got the Computer ON, and my Computer Light finally went off and finally my Malfunction Light went off.
Can you tell me when your Computer Light went off and your Malfunction Light went off?
Okay. When we put AC Power Switch from IGS to ACME - this is not supposed to power the computer - the Computer Light went off. When the Malfunction Light came on, then the Computer Light came back on again and the Malfunction Light stayed on. Pretty soon both of them got dimmer ... After 3 or 4 minutes, after we went to ACME power, the Computer Light went out. The Malfunction Light stayed on for about another 4 or 5 minutes, and finally it went out.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Hawaii.
Station calling Gemini 4, say again.
Roger. Hawaii calling Gemini 4. Would like to remind you, you have a critical tape dump over Guaymas. Acquisition time of Guaymas: 20 25 03. Did you copy? Over.
Negative. I did not copy.
Roger. A critical tape dump over Guaymas. Acquisition time 20 25 03. Did you copy? Over.
Roger. I think you said we are critical TM dump over Guaymas at 20:25.
Roger, roger.
Who am I talking to?
This is Hawaii.
Roger, Hawaii. Can you tell me how I'm doing on my electrical power.
Roger. Stand by.
Roger. Flight reports that you are doing great.
Above or below the predicted?
You have not used as much as predicted and should be well ahead. You're fat by approximately 160.
Roger. Understand I've got 160 amps more than we had planned.
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Have they got my computer figured out yet?
Negative on that, Gemini 4. They're working on it at the present time.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Roger. Gemini 4, we'd like for you to bring your AC Power Switch back to IGS and your Computer Switch ON, and we'd like for you to watch for a rise in the amperage to make sure it comes on.
Okay.
And we want you to leave this ON till you've just about finished your pass over here. We want to check the computer memory.
Okay. Coming on now.
This is Gemini 4. I've got the Malfunction Light on now, and it won't go out.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Roger, Guaymas. Gemini 4.
Roger. I'm not receiving T/M. I'm getting it intermittently now.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM. We're standing by for tape dump.
Roger. You want me to dump it, or can you dump it by command?
You'll have to dump it.
Okay. Tape playback coming on CONTINUOUS.
Guaymas CAP COM. Be advised that I can't get my Malfunction Light out on my computer now.
Roger.
Gemini 4, we're still not receiving dump.
Okay. I've got the tape playback in CONTINUOUS.
Still no modulation, Gemini 4.
Okay. Stand by.
Guaymas, Gemini 4. All the switches and circuit breakers are ON. You ought to be getting it.
Roger. Stand by.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Go ahead.
Did you place the Telemetry Switch to REAL-TIME and DUMP-TIME?
REAL-TIME and DELAYED-TIME?
Affirmative.
Okay. We can't command anything on. Is that right?
I got it now, Gemini 4.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Roger. Would you check your Indicator Light Test Circuit Breaker and turn it OFF and see if that turns off your Mal light. Over on your left panel.
You know the circuit breaker I mean, Jim?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4. I'm reading you loud and clear.
Roger. Turn off your Indicator Light Test Circuit Breaker over on your left circuit breaker panel.
Roger, I already have Gus, and it doesn't turn off the light.
Still doesn't do any good?
Nope.
Will you turn your Quantity Read ON for 10 seconds?
Jim, we show that the memory is okay, but we're showing about the same thing that you are otherwise.
Okay. Let me cycle the computer mode up to, say, Catch-Up and ... to Prelaunch.
Okay.
That doesn't seem to do any good.
You have the Computer Switch ON and your Power Switch on IGS. Right?
Roger. I have the Computer Switch ON and the Power Switch on IGS. Let me switch the Computer Switch OFF and back ON.
Jim, what I told you about your memory isn't correct. We're not able to check your memory this pass.
Okay. Be advised that even when we turn off the Computer Operate Switch, I still have the Malfunction Light on.
Roger. How about going to Catch-Up and hitting START COMP.
Okay.
And nothing happens when you hit your RESET button, huh?
Yes, the light goes out and then comes back on in a couple of seconds -- just like there's a malfunction.
Okay. Have you hit the START COMP?
Yes, that just turned the Computer Light on.
Okay, Jim. Go ahead and put your AC Power Switch to ACME. Leave your Computer Switch ON.
Leave the Computer Switch ON. Okay.
We'll work on it. We'll give you an answer when we get one.
Okay. Be advised that when we got to ACME the ... for just a short time, very dimly. Then it goes out.
Say that again.
...
Voice tape from pass at Tananarive during this period is not available at this time. Tananarive COM TECH reported to Houston CAP COM at 77 54 27 that he had contacted Gemini 4 and the crew had placed the Tape Playback Switch to COMMAND and the T/M Switch to COMMAND. No other report from Tananarive.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Be advised we do not have a valid oral temp on the Command Pilot.
Are you prepared for the Aero-Med Data Pass this station?
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
Roger, CSQ. You want an Aero-Med no. 1 Pass on the Pilot. Right?
On the Command Pilot. Skip the temperature and just give us the blood pressure.
Okay.
Is the Pilot awake?
Roger. He is.
Would you give me your status on main batteries?
Roger. Just a minute.
Okay. We've got full-scale on the cuff.
Turn the Quantity Read Switch OFF.
Gemini 4 Pilot, CSQ. Do you copy?
Go ahead. This is the Pilot.
Roger. What is the status on your main batteries?
Roger.
Roger. Advise the Command Pilot that the first blood pressure is good. Start exercise on your mark.
The main batteries are all 9 and 22 1/2.
MARK!
What's your status for the 63 Rev?
Our status is GO.
Roger. We are GO on the ground also. I am going to update your TR clock with the 63-1 TR.
Roger. I read my battery readout back to you as 9 and 22.5.
Roger. Got that.
And the adapters are all reading around 2 and 24 1/2.
You say amps reading 2 and voltage 22.5?
Roger. About 2 1/2.
Roger.
Be advised that Houston does not know yet what the problem is on the computer. You will be advised later.
I understand. Thank you.
Okay. We got a full-cuff on the blood pressure.
Your 63-1 GMTRC time I've got if you're prepared to copy.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. 63-1 16 hours 56 minutes 01 second.
Roger. 63-1 is 16 56 01.
Roger. And the second blood pressure is good.
Has the Command Pilot been drinking water?
I guess I've been drinking water, and I've had a meal. As a matter of fact, I'm half way through a meal. I started one, and we got involved in an experiment. I'll finish it. If you'll stand by I'll try to ...
He's half way through -- getting rid of half a meal.
He said he's half way through one meal?
That's affirmative.
How much water?
I've had about 10 gulps - 10 gulps in the last 3 hours.
Roger. Copy.
Okay. I have some flight plan items for you when you're prepared to copy.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Experiment MSC-2 and -3 ON and OFF are prescheduled times.
Roger. Do you have our ... on that?
Roger. The MSC-2 and -3 small-end-forward start at 23 hours 49 minutes. End at 15 minutes on Rev 52.
You were blocked out on that last transmission. Say again, please.
Roger. End of experiment -- end of MSC-2 and -3, 15 minutes the next day, Rev 92.
Did you copy?
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Hello Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Roger. I would like to complete your Flight Plan update. I'd like to confirm you got Item 2, MSC-2 and -3. Are you ready to copy?
Roger. We're ready to copy but speak slowly. You're breaking up.
Roger. Item 2 MSC-2 and -3. SEF pass start at 23:49 Zulu. End at 00:15. Rev 52. Did you copy? Over.
Affirmative. MSC-2 and -3. Small-end-forward 23:49. End at 00:15. Rev 52.
Roger. D-8 Experiment Check no. 1. Start at 23:57. Check no. 2. Start at 01:30. Item no. 4, Onboard Map Update: Rev 50, ascending node 102° East at G.m.t. of 21:26. Item no. 5: if possible, S-6 photos of tropical storm off the west coast of Mexico. Tropical storm Victoria. Item no. 6: Delete Apollo Landmark Run no.7. Area is too cloudy. Did you copy? Over.
Roger. I copied all the information.
Roger. You look good here on the ground, Gemini 4.
You look good up here also.
Roger. Hawaii CAP COM standing by.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Go ahead Guaymas, Gemini 4.
Roger. All systems look green. Flight would like you to think about where you plan on storing the equipment. They'd like to come up with a CG. So, in the next few hours, if you could, we'd like you to think about it and maybe tell us where you're going to put all those things.
Okay. We've already thought about it. We thought about it quite early in the ball game. We're going to put the event pack back down in the wheel well -- the foot well on the right-hand side, bolted back down where it was for launch.
Rog.
We're going to take the cable and Ed's going to hold it between his legs, about level with the bottom of the seat.
Rog.
We're going to put the gun back in our center food box.
Roger.
We're ready to put the film in the center food box.
Say again?
We're going to put the film -- the camera film --
Roger.
We're going to put the cameras in the left-hand food box.
Roger.
We're going to put the sextant in the middle food box.
Roger.
And all the refuse is going in the right-hand food box.
Roger.
And I think that takes care of it.
Roger. We got it.
Okay. The refuse that doesn't fit in the right-hand food box will go either in the left-hand food box or the side-wall boxes where we've got the film.
Roger.
The sleeves off Ed's suit and extra thick garment on one of my legs will be stowed in my foot well on the left side.
Roger.
And I think that takes care of it.
Sounds like you're kind of crowded up there.
It's pretty deep. I can just barely see out of the window.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Flight would like to know how much that refuse weighs.
About 3000 pounds!
I'll pass that along.
... the packages that the food came in, the defecation bags, and a lot of waste paper like that. So it shouldn't be too heavy.
Roger.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
...
Roger. Houston requests we pass the following information to you regarding the computer problem. Do you copy?
Roger. Stand by one, please.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. They report that in ground testing on spacecraft GT-2 and GT-3 this same problem was encountered and it apparently was caused by the computer being too cold. Houston requests you to take the following action. Do you copy?
Roger, copy and standing by.
Roger. Computer Switch to OFF. AC Power Switch to IGS. Then Computer Switch to ON. Do you copy?
Roger. Computer OFF. IGS to ON and computer ON.
Roger. After about 20 minutes, start punching the Malfunction Light to see if it will reset and extinguish.
Roger. Then wait 20 minutes to see if it will reset and extinguish.
Roger.
Gemini 4. If the Malfunction Light does not reset the first time, keep trying at intervals of 5 to 10 minutes.
Roger. If it doesn't reset the first time, try at intervals of 5 to 10 minutes.
Roger.
If we get that thing operating again, do you want us to leave it to operate?
Roger. That will be left on for the rest of the flight.
Sounds like a good idea to me.
Say again.
I said that sounds like a pretty good idea to me.
Roger. This is an attempt to get the computer warmed up and also recharge the ACPU which is probably run down at this time.
Roger. ...
Roger. All systems look good on the ground here. That's all we have unless you have something else to report.
Report. A negative on the sighting of tropical storm Victoria ... as when we passed over we were a little bit west of it, and there wasn't a good picture.
Roger, understand.
... the Command Pilot.
Say again about Command Pilot.
Command Pilot is retiring for the evening.
Roger.
Good night.
Roger.
We'll be seeing you next pass.
Roger. Thank you very much.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Roger. We would like to find out if you tried the procedure that was given you over CSQ on your computer.
That's affirmative. The procedure was given to me 10 minutes ago. I have 10 more minutes to wait until I try to reset.
Roger, Gemini 4. We heard that.
How's everything down there?
You're looking good from here, Gemini 4.
Roger. All is fine up here.
Roger.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead RKV, Gemini 4.
Roger. We're showing an indication here on the ground of the computer being in a Prelaunch Mode. We're also showing a malfunction indication. How does it look up there?
That's affirmative, and I've been unable to reset it.
Roger. Flight advises that it may take a little while. Continue attempting to reset during this Rev.
Roger. Wi11 do.
All your systems look good here on the ground. We'll stand by for the rest of this pass.
Roger. They're all good up here, also.
Roger.
Gemini 4, CSQ CAP COM. Do you copy?
Go ahead CSQ, Gemini 4.
Roger. Flight advises it may take several orbits for your computer to come on line. Would like for you to leave the computer at the Prelaunch Mode and ground will advise you later.
Roger. I understand leave the computer in Prelaunch Mode.
Roger. Ground will follow trend data and advise you later.
Roger, I understand.
Be advised also that you have a critical tape dump over Hawaii, and also a Medical Pass.
Roger, I understand.
That's in about 7 or 8 minutes.
Roger.
Also, we have the new computations on your orbit. Perigee 85.3 and apogee 139, with a 3-day lifetime.
... Roger, understand. 85 by 139.
Roger.
Gemini 4, give us your Quantity Read Switch for about 15 seconds.
Roger. Switch is on READ.
Roger. We've got it.
Okay, we've got your quantity.
Quantity OFF.
All systems look GO down here.
They're all GO up here, too.
Roger.
Gemini 4, CSQ. That's all we have. We're standing by.
Roger CSQ. Thank you very much.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. We have your temperature. You can start your blood pressure and stand by for our Surgeon.
Roger, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Hawaii Surgeon.
Go ahead Hawaii, Gemini 4.
We're having some difficulty recording blood pressure on the ground, but our data is being remoted to Houston. So let's try it once more.
Roger, pumping it up again.
Full-scale.
We have a valid blood pressure. Standing by for exercise on your mark.
MARK!
Gemini 4, Hawaii Surgeon. Be advised we had telemetry dropout, and may have missed your second blood pressure. Have you transmitted yet?
Roger, I have transmitted.
Roger. Would you give us one more, please?
Roger. Coming again.
Cuff is full-scale.
Looks like this will be a good one. Standing by for your food, water, and sleep report.
Roger. I've started on the meal 1 of day 4. I've had about 8 swallows of water. I slept about an hour and a half in the last 4 hours' sleep period.
Roger. Was it good sleep?
It was good sound sleep and I don't feel that I require anymore.
Roger. Thank you, Gemini 4. Back over to Hawaii CAP COM.
Rog.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM, I have a D-9 update for you when you're ready to copy.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Roger. I ham a D-9 update for you whenever you're ready to copy.
Roger, ready to go.
Apollo Run 4. Your start time 00 02 45. Stop time 00 03 21. Did you copy? Over.
Roger. Understand Apollo Run 4 is 00 02 45, 00 03 21.
That's it.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead Hawaii. Gemini 4.
Roger. Those times I gave you were in error. That is 02 hours 45 minutes for your start time, 03 hours 21 minutes for your stop time.
Roger. 02:45 and 03:21. That -- I copied them also.
Roger.
Be advised my last MSC Pass through the anomaly, I didn't feel that I had a good yaw reference small-end-forward on this run to be sure we have a good run. I'll do a modified version of Apollo no. 4.
Roger, understand.
This is Hawaii CAP COM. Standing by. Everything looks good on the ground.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM. Be advised that your coolant temperatures are coming up, and we do feel optimistic about your computer problem.
Did you copy, Gemini 4?
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Roger RKV, Gemini 4.
Roger. We're showing the pumps ON in both loops on the ground. Is that correct?
That's affirmative. I turned the secondary pump ON ...
Roger.
Do you have any ...
Say again.
Do you have any ...
Do not understand. Say again, please.
Roger. Hawaii was trying to give me some type of update concerning the fuel consumed when we had LOS. Do you have that message for me?
Roger. We sure do. Indications are that the system is beginning to warm up somewhat and we feel that the computer will come on before long.
Would you turn the secondary loop back OFF, please.
Say again, please.
Roger. Would you turn the secondary loop OFF again, please.
Secondary loop OFF.
Roger.
I have a Pegasus update for you.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Roger. That's Pegasus will be on the horizon. Line of flight near CSQ, your 53 Rev. If you track pitch, you will be at 90° pitch-up. G.m.t. 02:28. Slant range, 268 nautical miles. Do you copy?
Roger, understand. Pegasus, my 53rd Rev, near the CSQ area. 090 vertical at 02:28.
Roger, a slant range 268 nautical miles.
Roger, 268 nautical miles.
We're showing approximately 950 pounds on your oxygen. Would you turn the Repress ON and run that Primary oxygen down a ways?
Roger.
Will you bring it on down to about 850?
I'd rather not right now. The Command Pilot is sleeping, and we don't have him suited up in glove and helmet.
Roger. We concur.
Gemini 4, would you attempt another reset on that computer malfunction?
Set's on.
Roger.
This is RKV standing by. We have about 3 minutes left.
Gemini 4, RKV standing by. We have about 3 minutes left.
Roger RKV. Thank you.
RKV, this is Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, RKV.
Roger. Looks like the whole ...
Roger, thank you. We saw you during the last pass.
Gemini 4, CSQ CAP COM. Be advised if you're tracking Pegasus, do not exceed 45° pitch. You've got a critical tape dump. If you are tracking Pegasus, please go to critical tape dump attitude.
Please advise.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
CSQ, Gemini 4.
Are you tracking Pegasus?
Trying to find it!
Okay. We've got a critical tape dump. Are you in attitude?
It would be a little hard to track Pegasus and be in attitude, which do you want me to do?
Don't exceed 45° pitch. We want this tape dump.
Roger, understand, Art. To track data at this pass, I've got to get up to 90.
Okay. We want the tape dump, so omit Pegasus.
Roger.
Let me know when you're in attitude.
Roger.
Gemini 4 is in attitude.
Roger.
I have an Orbital Map update for you.
Roger. Let me know when you dump the tape and I'll go back to track it.
Roger. We will do.
Gemini 4, CSQ. Had you spotted Pegasus?
Negative. I'm trying to.
As soon as I get my tape dumped I'll get back up.
Roger, will do.
Okay, your map update ascending node Rev 53. longitude 35° East at 01 hours 51 minutes.
Roger, understand. 53rd Rev, longitude 35° East at 01:51.
Roger. Would you reset your Malfunction Light?
Roger. I have tried to reset it quite a few times and it hasn't been successful.
Roger. I also have some CLA and PLA updates for you. Are you prepared to copy?
I'll give you just one and let RKV pass the rest and give you a chance to go back to track.
Roger, prepared.
Roger. 54-DELTA 86. 01+49. 03 02 14. 10+36.
Roger, got it.
Okay. Go ahead, Gemini 4. Resume track to Pegasus.
Gemini 4, CSQ. You copy?
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
Gemini 4, CSQ. Do you copy?
Roger, CSQ. Gemini reads you five square.
Roger. We have some PLA and CLA data, will you prepare to copy?
Roger.
Roger. Area 55-DELTA 82. 04 34 10. 9+57. Area 55-3 split burn, 55 aft, 109 forward. 1+31. 2+17. 05 15 40. 02+33. 08+47. How's it going?
Roger, we copied.
You copy that last?
Roger.
Roger. Area 56-DELTA 81. 1+42. 06 06 36. 5+11. 13+39. Got that one?
Roger.
56-BRAVO split burn, 55 forward, 106 aft. 1+31. 2+15. 06 57 55. 6+42. Area 57-BRAVO split burn, 55 forward, 103 aft. 1. 1+31. 2+10. 08 27 38. 7+22. Do you copy?
Roger.
Roger. Area 57-2 86. 1+49. 07 42 52. 7+12. 11+52. 58-2 94. 1+59. 09 16 42. 5+49. 10+41. Area 58-BRAVO split burn, 55 forward, 51 aft. 1+31. 1+54. 10 00 10. 9+03. Area 55-2 104. 2+12. 10 50 54. 4+26. 9+45. Do you copy?
Roger.
Roger. We're reading 960 on your primary O<sub>2</sub> pressure, you might watch that.
Roger, I'll try to hold that. Could you give me 55-DELTA again? You were a little garbled.
Roger, first reading. 55-DELTA 82. 1+44. 04 34 10. 9+57.
Roger, then the next one was 55-3?
The last one 55-DELTA. 55-DELTA. Do you copy? Gemini 4, CSQ. Did you copy that?
The light-weight headsets are not comfortable to wear. They have a good generating mark to them.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, this is Houston. We would like information on what D-9 has been accomplished.
Roger, understand. You'd like information on what D-9 Experiment has been accomplished.
That's affirmative. The run numbers that you have completed and also what stars you are using for the Apollo D-9.
Roger. Stand by one, please. On the Apollo D-9 Run 4 we had Antares and Scorpii. And we made a long run on that one and a short one. We made also a run on Antares and the third order magnitude star in Scorpio. We made no Apollo star to booster sightings. We have made three Air Force D-9 runs. Houston, Gemini 4. Are you reading?
This is Houston. Reading you loud and clear and understand you have made three Air Force D-9's, an Apollo no. 4 on Antares and one of the stars in Scorpio, a long and a short run. You got a long Antares and the third magnitude on Scorpio. Right?
Roger. The two stars in Scorpio are Scorpii and Antares. Those are the ones about 21° apart.
Roger, I copied those.
And the Air Force D-9 run -- the way they're laid out is difficult to run. We got some runs though, in different order and accomplished basically the information that they wanted in D-9.
Understand. You basically accomplished what the Air Force wanted. We'll analyze this in Flight Plan and try to get you a final update for D-9.
Roger, understand. Thank you.
Gemini 4, this is Houston. Did you have any luck tracking Pegasus B on that CSQ pass?
Negative. I had to come down for that tape dump and when I went back up I didn't have any luck. The sun was just about 90° also. And there's a lot of stuff on the outside of my window which makes a lot of reflection. Very difficult to see.
Roger. On your fuel status latest analysis looks like we're just going to have enough to complete the Flight Plan and still keep our gage in accuracy past there. Try to be as judicious as possible with it now.
In Horizon Scanners with Pulse only.
I didn't copy that.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. If you read, give me your latest relative humidity.
Houston, Gemini 4. The humidity reading is 79 dry bulb, 62 wet bulb.
Say again your wet bulb.
62, 62.
Roger; 79 dry, 62 wet. We'll compute it, thank you.
Still staying around 62, 63 percent.
Roger.
We've been going with gloves off and visor open, now, for the last day or so.
Understand that. Are you trying to get about one reading per Rev and put it in your log?
We're keeping them up as the experiments display.
Okay, thank you. Houston out.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead RKV, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead, RKV.
Roger. We want to take a check on your computer malfunction during this pass. Would like to have you depress it and hold it for 5 seconds. Give me a mark at the beginning and the end.
Roger, will do. MARK!
MARK!
Roger. Thank you.
We'll be standing by on the next pass for Med Type 1 on the Command Pilot if he is awake. The time of that will be approximately 05 hours 58 minutes.
Roger, 05:58.
Did you get my mark?
Gemini 4, RKV.
You might find out if they want to get a Type 1 Medical Pass on the Pilot yet. I'll be going to sleep probably in a little bit.
Roger. I'll check right now.
Gemini 4, this is RKV. That's affirmative. If the Command Pilot is not awake we'll take a Type 1 on the Pilot.
Roger. Do you want that the next Rev or now?
Roger. That will be on the next Rev.
The Pilot ...
Roger. Do you want to give us a blood pressure on this one?
Roger. I'll start a temperature for you and then work on a blood pressure.
Roger.
You're full-scale.
That's a good blood pressure, give your exercises.
MARK!
You're full-scale.
That's a good blood pressure. Could you give me your report?
Roger. I've finished meal 1 of day 4. I've had 6 swallows of water, and I'll be going to bed here probably in the next hour or two ... since last report.
RKV Surgeon. Roger. Good report, thank you.
Roger. See you next Rev.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Hello Houston, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Put your Tape Playback Switch to RESET, please.
Roger, going to RESET.
Roger. I'd like to give you a little briefing what we came up with for the terminal reentry maneuver. Are you copying me clearly?
...
Okay. We looked at all the possible possibilities down here. About the worst case we could come up with is your 3-sigma error miss distance -- worst case 70 nautical miles. That's 70. What we would like to have you do is an OAMS retro maneuver; then we will have a manual retrofire, of course, with no computer. We want a zero-lift, rolling reentry. That's zero-lift, rolling reentry. The reason for the decision on the rolling versus a 90-90 bank is that there's less chance of dispersions. They will tend to equalize out. We feel we can have a faster recovery that way. Also, doing it that way we can get an IP prior to your blackout and you should pull about 8g's on that reentry. Do you copy?
Roger. Understand a maximum 3-sigma miss distance of 70 nautical miles, an OAMS retro, a manual retrofire, a zero-lift rolling, I got a faster recovery, be able to plot point of impact.
Roger. You got all of that. Now this zero-lift rolling only applies to your terminal maneuvers. All your CLA's and PLA's onboard are still the 60° bank.
Roger, understand.
Okay. I have a D-9 update for you. It's a Run no. 1, Revolution 55 and 56. Start time 05 48 45, use stars of opportunity.
Roger. Rev 55, and no. 1, start time 05 48 55 and say the last part.
That start time is 05 48 45, use stars of opportunity.
Stars of opportunity?
Gemini 4, I did not get your last transmission. I say again, use stars of opportunity.
Roger, stars of opportunity.
Okay, do you have any questions you would like the ground to answer with regards to your reentry?
Gemini 4, this is Houston. We passed up this reentry so you two could talk it over and come back later on if you have any questions. For your information, the 63-1 weather forecast looks like about 3- to 4-foot waves with 18 knots of wind, visibility and ceiling will be good.
Roger, understand. Was that an Apollo 9 or D-9 for that Rev 55?
That is a D-9 Run no. 1. Stand by and I'll get further clarification.
Gemini 4, this is Houston. That is not Apollo, it's just straight D-9.
All right, D-9.
And that's all I have from Houston. Standing by.
...
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead RKV, Gemini 4.
Roger. We have a valid temperature. Would you pump up your blood pressure?
Pump.
Gemini 4, this is RKV Surgeon. Would you give us the blood -- there it goes. Blood pressure is going up.
Roger.
All right, Gemini 4. We have your blood pressure. Give me a mark on your exercise.
MARK! ...
MARK!
Okay, your cuff is full-scale.
Gemini 4, we have a good blood pressure. Standing by for your food, water, and sleep report.
Roger. Gemini 4 here. This is the Command Pilot. I just finished about a 5 and a half hour nap of which the last 3 hours of sleep were quite good. The first 2 and a half were rather fitful. I'm in the process of eating meal 2 of day 4 and I haven't had but about 5 swallows of water since I woke up but I plan on having about another 10 or 15 before I finish, along with the meal.
Real fine, thank you, Gemini 4. RKV Surgeon out.
Roger.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead RKV CAP COM, Gemini 4.
Roger. Would you give us Quantity Read for 15 seconds?
Roger.
Roger. That's good on the quantity read.
The switch is OFF. Be advised I dumped the pressure down to about 880 ...
Roger.
The coating on the gingerbread wrappers. It tastes very waxy as it ... lined the inside of my mouth. It is something comparable to what was on the sandwiches. I put one inside my mouth after I had eaten a little bit ... feels like somebody spread lard all over your tongue.
Gemini 4, RKV CAP COM.
Hello RKV. Gemini 4.
Roger. I have two Apollo Landmark updates for you. Are you prepared to copy?
Just a moment.
Go ahead RKV. We copy.
Okay. Roger. It will be for Rev 57. Sequence no. 16, at a G.m.t. of 08 hours 11 minutes. Yaw 12°, pitch 30°, use 16-mm camera. Rev 58, sequence 12, G.m.t. 09 hours 36 minutes, yaw 3°, pitch 30°, use 16-mm camera. Do you copy?
Roger. Rev 57, Sequence 16, 08:11, yaw 12°, pitch 30°, 16-mm camera. Rev 58, sequence 12, 09:36, yaw 3°, pitch 30, using 16-mm camera.
That's affirmative. We also have the computer test for you. Are you prepared to copy?
Go ahead.
Okay. We want to check the computer in all modes. There will be three steps to this check. First step: put 10 ft/sec in all IVI windows. Then push the Malfunction Reset. Then press the Start Comp and watch for a Computer Running Light indication. You will do this in all modes. If you do not - I repeat - do not get an indication of computer running, then you will perform another test. In this other test, you will check in all modes. You will turn the computer OFF for 2 seconds - the Computer power OFF for 2 seconds. After the computer has been repowered, repress the manual Malfunction Reset and also Start Comp. If you get a Computer Running Light in any mode, discontinue this 2-second power off. Do you copy?
Roger. Computer check of all modes. Insert 10 ft/sec in all the IVI's, push the Malfunction Light, and push the Start Comp button. ... is ... turn the computer OFF for 2 seconds, repower and depress the Malfunction Light. If we get those ... at any time, well, we should discontinue the test.
Roger. That's affirmative. We're standing by here for you to start it. If you can't finish it over our site, go ahead and report the results to the Canary Islands.
Okay. We've done these things already without any results, but I'll go ahead and go over them again.
Okay.
Flight advises that if you do get a Running Light indication during the second set of tests, then go back to the first set and repeat that in each mode.
Roger. Will do.
Gemini 4, RKV. We're standing by for your check on that computer.
Roger. I'm doing it right now.
Okay.
We can't insert anything in the IVI's ...
Okay. We understand.
... on the second test.
Gemini 4, on this insertion of the IVI's, you are to do that manually. Is this the way you've been doing it?
I've been doing it through the MDIU.
Negative. Do it manually on the IVI indicator there.
That doesn't do anything.
That's the way they want you to do it. They want to see if there's any change in the IVI windows as you run through the test.
Okay.
... going through the test.
Roger. Everything still looks good from here except your computer. I have a map update for you.
Stand by just a minute.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. I'd like to get the results of the computer test first.
Thought you'd ask. Nothing happened when IVI ... went to the IVI's just as they were.
It's impossible to put anything through the MDIU. When you tried turning it off, you still got your Ma1function Light back and nothing happened when you started -- pressed the Start Comp.
That's affirmative.
Roger, here is your map update when you are ready.
Okay, go ahead.
It's on Rev 56, longitude at 33° West, at G.m.t. 06 17 00.
Roger. Thank you.
I tell you, Canary, I think that computer died when we turned the power OFF with the switch stuck ON.
Say again.
I said I think that computer died when we turned the power OFF with the switch stuck in the ON position.
I think everybody else is thinking the same thing.
I just made a run on Target 16-A. The air field at Basra, it's right at the Persian Gulf. I picked it up -- I picked the Persian Gulf up about ... an angle of about 30° ... I pitched down then picked up the lake. ... northwest of the Persian Gulf. Basra being right on the lakes, very near the lakes, you can just follow over and pick up the airfield right away. So I got the airfield out quite a ways before I got to the target, and then just started tracking on the target. I was actually on the target by the time I was still 20° from the vertical, I would guess - and tracked it on out from the runway to about the 40° point past it, and I stopped tracking. I had this 75-mm lens on the 16-mm camera with the adapter on it to take pictures out the forward end and I had it running from the last experiment ... for the target -
Well, we saw Australia for the first time in the daylight. First passed up Basra then across the islands of India. On across India to Malaysia and on across to Australia ... we certainly -- only passed about half so far.
I've seen an awful lot of North Africa ... daylight -- know quite well. I've just completed D-9 Apollo Landmark run on Target 14. I had a very good pickup. I had seen the target before; I knew where it was. I got right on the thing about 30° below the horizon and got on the area, and picked up the specific target at about 20°, 30° from the vertical. Got on the target at about 30° from the vertical and then tracked it to the vertical and then back off ... back up, straight on, and then back up.
... picture.
... nice shot.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM Over.
Hello Houston, this is Gemini 4.
Roger, hello there, Jim. We'd like a sub-quantity readout, please.
Roger. Propellant quantity readout. Just a minute.
Looks like about 48 percent.
Roger, understand. 48 percent. There will be no Medical Data Pass at Canaries this time around. No Medical Data Pass at Canaries.
Okay.
And I've got a change to the Apollo Landmark outfit.
Roger, stand by a minute.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay. You can change -- delete Sequence 12 and make it Sequence 14. It'll be on this orbit, Orbit 58. At time 09 40 22. Minus 6° yaw, and minus 30° pitch.
Okay, it'll be Sequence no. 14 at 09 40 22 minus 6, and minus 30.
Roger, and understand Ed will be asleep during this time. Is that correct?
That is correct.
Okay. We want to just advise you to use all the film. This is your last experiment. Use all the film you have at your option. Jim's here and we'd like to discuss this reentry with you a little bit. One other thing, Jim, we have increased the lifetime of your aft thrusters to 131 ft/sec, and you will receive no split burn on OAMS retro.
Very good, very good. I was wondering what you were going to do about that.
Yes, we've been holding on to that for a while and thought we'd surprise you. Here's Jim.
Gemini 4, this is Shakey here.
Hello Shakey here, how are you?
Fine. Listen, what are your feelings on a rolling reentry versus the 90° bank angle? We're recommending a rolling here.
Yes, it's not very imaginative, but it gets the job done. So why don't we go ahead with it?
Roger. Here is the format which we'll send up to you for a rolling reentry. We'll give you the ∆V and ∆T for your OAMS burn. We'll give you the GMTRC. We'll give you a RET of .05g. And then you will also get the RET of drogue, of main, and of landing. Your procedure will be at retro to go to full lift, heads down. At the RET of .05g you will go into a 15° roll rate. When you reach 100,000, when the altimeter comes off the peg, go to full lift. How does that sound to you, Jim?
Roger. I think I've blocked part of you out. Right after retrofire we go to full lift and at .05g, or at that time, we go to 15 deg/sec and at 100,000 we go to full lift again.
That's right. The only difference between the format before is that instead of the RET of 400,000 we'll give you .05g RET when you start your roll rate.
Okay, that sounds good.
This will give you a trim angle into the atmosphere, a roll rate, and then full lift at 100,000 again for your drogue and main deploy.
Okay, very good.
Shades of Mercury, Jim.
I was going to say I'll bet you Flight Directors were thinking of this one.
That's why I say not very imaginative, but I guess it gets the job done.
Roger. I have a bet with your wife that you'll get within 5 miles. Now you've got to hold up my end here.
Okay. I'm going to try to hold up my end, too. Remember when I said we'd never make a closed looper?
Doesn't look like we'll make one this time.
Yes.
Hey, Jim, we're still going to pass you your updates for 60 through 64-4 with the bank angles in. Just the same as we've been passing them, with the exception of 63-1.
That's affirmative. Don't change those; we just want the final one.
Roger, that'll come up just as it has been coming up and you'll get them at Canary.
Okay.
Hey, listen, are you feeling pretty tired now, or are you pretty good?
No, I'm pretty -- I'm pretty sleepy and tired and I think that Ed probably is, too.
Righto, I understand you're kind of sleepy and tired. We're going to try to hold off the last couple orbits just to prepare for reentry.
Yes, it's going to take us about 3 or 4 hours to get all of this stuff packed.
Righto.
Gemini 4, this is Houston. It looks like you're going to have good weather in the reentry area -- in the splash area.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Hello Canary, Gemini 4.
Roger. I have ten retro updates for you.
Okay. Go.
60-1 92. 1+57. 12 12 54. 6+00. 10+51. 60 -- correction -- 61-1: 104. 2+11. 13 48 06. 4+23. 9+40. 62-1: 113. 2+23. 15 22 05. 3+16. 10+48. 63-1: 127. 2+40. 16 55 57. 2+25. 15 deg/sec roll. 64-4: 101. 2+07. 19 41 30. 4+27. 9+43. 59-BRAVO: 105. 2+13. 11 32 44. 10+48. 60-BRAVO: 120. 2+32. 13 05 56. 10+58. 61-BRAVO: 93. 1+58 14 45 02. 11+04. 62-BRAVO: 85. 1+47. 16 18 08. 10+29. 63-BRAVO: 82. 1+44. 17 48 43. 10+07. And that's it. Do you have it?
Roger. Got them.
You're still looking good and we're standing by.
Okay.
Canaries, Gemini 4 here again.
Go ahead.
I'd like to have you remind the Assistant Flight Director that we're not going to be able to read out any ∆V. It will be just on OAMS firing on time.
Roger, will do.
Thank you.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Okay. You're looking good here on the ground. How are you doing?
Everything is fine up here.
Okay, roger.
Say, I finally saw Australia in the daylight.
Can you see the ground?
Yes. I can see the ground now, and I can see the ...
Roger. How does the weather look over the whole coast?
Well, let's see. I don't know which way I'm pointing right now. Looks quite good along the coast.
How much ground can you see?
...
I'm in a bad attitude right now. Let me just fire along here and I'll tell you.
Roger.
I got the curves here ... Rev 58.
Okay.
Are you doing a little rolling?
Roger, I am.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Roger, Jim. We'd like your Quantity Read Switch ON for about 15 seconds and I have a map update if you are ready to copy.
Okay. Go ahead with the map update.
Okay. At the end of Rev 59 ascending node longitude 124° West, G.m.t. 12 10 00.
Gemini 4, Houston. You can turn your Quantity Read OFF.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead Canary, Gemini 4.
Roger, I just want to remind the Pilot that he has a Medical Pass Type 1. Have the temperature probe inserted.
Okee-doke. What time is that pass?
Stand by.
Carnarvon's acquisition 11 53 13.
11:35. Roger.
Command Pilot, Canary CAP COM. Flight wants to know if you are planning to sleep now.
Roger, I am. In about another 10 or 15 minutes.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Have you been lowering your Primary O<sub>2</sub> bottle pressure?
We have just a little bit. Not by dumping it, but just by letting it bleed into our cabin bringing it up to about 5.3.
Roger. We have a slight rise in cabin pressure. Thank you.
Say that again.
We noted a slight rise in cabin pressure. Thank you.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead, Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon. Will the Pilot put the oral temp probe in his mouth, please.
Roger.
Gemini 4, stand by for your ...
Roger, sure will ... from a long way ...
Gemini 4, this is Carnarvon Surgeon. We are ready to get a blood pressure.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon Surgeon. Would you keep the temperature probe in your mouth while you're doing the blood pressure?
Roger, will do.
...
Roger, Gemini 4. We have now a blood pressure. Ready for the exercise on your mark.
MARK!
Okay, the first count.
Can you give us your state of water in ... Gemini 4?
Roger. The Pilot just woke up, he had meal 2 of day 4, and 5 swallows of water, and had a very good rest of around 5 hours.
Roger ... thank you very much.
Roger, feel fine.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. You're looking good here on the ground, how're you doing?
Roger, looking great.
Okay. Need anything at all?
No, everything seems to be in pretty good shape up here.
Okay. We'll just stand by in case you need anything.
All right. How does it look down there?
Real fine. The weather has cleared up and everybody's happy. We're standing by for you.
Roger. Did it finally stop raining?
Say again.
Did it finally stop raining?
Roger. The young astronaut did a rain dance.
Very good. That's supposed to bring rain, isn't it?
I don't know. The way he did the dance you can't tell.
Yes. Who are you with?
Dave Scott.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM. Did you get a briefing on the retrofire procedure?
Roger, if it hasn't changed from 4 or 5 hours ago, I have.
We're going to do a manual retro with OAMS - a manual retro with holdup.
Affirm.
Roger.
Okay. That'll be a OAMS burn with automatic countdown at TR, backup with a manual retrofire. That'll be a rolling reentry.
Roger. I thought we were going to make a manual TR.
Well, your clock seems to be working real fine, I think they're going to let it go for an auto and then let you back it up.
Okay. That sounds fair.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Roger, Gemini 4. How are you doing, Ed?
Pretty good. Had a good night's sleep and ... water.
Roger. We're discussing this reentry profile and we'll get you the final data up just as soon as we come up with a final answer.
Roger, sounds good.
It looks like now, however, we're going to power up your platform about 45 minutes earlier than the Flight Plan calls for. It'll be an elapsed time of 95+19. That'll be over Carnarvon on the 61st Rev.
Roger, 95:19.
Gemini 4, Houston. Have you been using quite a bit of OAMS altitude control for the last orbit or so?
Say again, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, stayed in Pulse - Horizon Scan the whole time. There hasn't been much in the way of attitude control.
Roger. We got that.
Gemini 4, Houston.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Go ahead Canary, Gemini 4.
Okay Gemini 4. You look good on the ground. Are your systems still GO?
Roger, all systems are GO here.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead Carnarvon, Gemini 4.
Roger, we'd like you to take and place your Reentry C-band Beacon to the CONTINUOUS position.
Roger. We have the C-band going to CONTINUOUS.
Roger. Your Antenna Selector to REENTRY position.
Roger. Antenna Select to REENTRY.
Roger. Want you to leave it in that position for the remainder of the flight.
Roger, understand.
Okay. I've got a map update for you if you are ready to copy.
Wait one minute, please.
Go ahead with the update.
Rev 62 longitude 168° East, and a G.m.t. of 16 35 00.
Roger. Run 62, 168° East and 16 35 00.
Roger.
I was looking for you on that pass ...
All right.
Okay, you're looking good on the ground.
Roger. Everything's looking good up here.
Roger.
Jim is asleep, isn't he?
Roger ...
Roger.
...
Say again.
...
Yeah, I bet you.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Roger, turn your Quantity Read Switch ON please, and we'd like a propellant quantity readout.
Roger. Propellant quantity reads 45 percent.
Understand, 45 percent. And have you had one or two suit fans on?
We had two suit fans on for about the last 2 hours.
Roger, understand. Two suit fans.
We're to one now.
Roger, you're back to one. And what time did the Command Pilot wake?
Oh, about 15 minutes ago.
Roger, 15 minutes ago. Jim, I'm going to pass you the general procedures for the reentry. You'll get the 63-1 update and the details on your next pass over the States from Gus. The general procedure we'd like you to follow is: after retrofire, roll to the normal position to a heads-down position, for full lift to 400 K. We will give you an altitude angle to hold down to 400 K, then we'd like you to roll at 15 deg/sec till the altimeter comes off the peg or approximately 100 K and then back to full lift again till drogue.
Roger, understand.
Roger. The only change since we went over this the last time is that we're using 400 K instead of .05g.
Roger, understand.
Gemini 4, Houston. You can take the Quantity Read Switch off now.
Okay.
Gemini 4, this is Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger, we'd like your propellant temperature and pressure.
Temperature is about 65, pressure is about - 1700, 1745, something like that.
Roger. We got 65 and 1700, 1725.
Roger, that's what we got.
Hey, Houston, Gemini 4.
Go ahead, Gemini 4.
Houston, Gemini 4.
This is Houston. Go ahead Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Gemini 4, this is Houston. Go ahead.
Roger. It's pretty obvious that the computer isn't going to work. Why don't we turn it off?
Gemini 4, Houston. We'd like to go ahead and leave it on. Won't go into detail.
Okay.
Roger. And the weather looks very, very good in the recovery area.
Okay. Don't forget, I want to be recovered in a hurry!
Roger. They're on their way. All you got to do is hit the spot.
Okay.
Roger, Jim. It looks real good from here. We got the targeting area and the procedures worked out to get the recovery forces there real quick.
Okay.
And, James, this looks like about an 8g recovery.
Oh, that's too much for an old man like me, old Shake.
You can hack it.
Hey Houston, this is Gemini 4. We just took our -- oops, stand by.
Gemini 4, this is Houston. How are you doing?
Very good. We're just taking a couple of pictures. That's what the "oops" was for.
Oh, you had us shook up for a minute. Don't do that, you're giving us heart attacks down here.
Oh, come on, John, it must have been a long night. If I were you, I'd be looking for a little excitement.
Hey, Jim.
Yes, go ahead.
With this zero-lift reentry, we'll be able to predict your IP and have the recovery forces moving to your landing point about 15 minutes before you get there. We think that's the safest and quickest way to get there.
Okay, Chris, I don't disagree at all. I agree.
Roger.
I just think it's old-fashioned.
Roger. If you wouldn't foul up our computer.
Gemini 4, this is Houston.
Go.
Roger, on your 63-1 update do you have any use for the OAMS ∆V? We were just going to pass the ∆T.
Yeah, send the ∆T - will be fine. I also want it without OAMS.
Roger, it'll be there.
Okay. And we'll probably - if we have a short OAMS burn we're going to correct our retrofire time just like we would if we had a short OAMS burn otherwise.
Roger. That's good.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM.
Roger Canary, Gemini 4.
Roger. We need the oral temp probe in the Pilot's mouth.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Canary CAP COM. Your systems look good, stand by for Surgeon.
Roger.
Gemini 4, this is Canary's Surgeon. Leave the oral probe in, but pump up your blood pressure cuff.
Cuff is full-scale, Canary -- Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Canary Surgeon. Blood pressure is received. Standing by for your food, water, and sleep reports since your last Medical Data Pass.
Roger. I'm preparing to eat meal 3 of the 4th day. I've had 6 swallows of water and I had a very sound 5 hours of sleep.
Gemini 4, Canary Surgeon. That sleep was all before your last report period?
I will - Canary Surgeon returning you to Canary CAP COM.
Roger.
...
All right.
I imagine I'll get mine as soon as I hit the water.
Roger. I understand.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Go ahead Guaymas, Gemini 4.
Roger. We've got telemetry solid.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead Houston, Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Houston. Are you ready to copy your 63-1 time?
Stand by just a second.
Roger.
Okay, go ahead.
Okay. Your time to burn is 2 minutes 40 seconds, at 16 56 01. Time to 400 K is 2 minutes 38 seconds.
Say it again. The only thing I got was 2 minutes and 38 seconds.
Roger. Time to burn is 2+40. GMTRC is 16 56 01. 400 K is 2+38.
Roger. 2+40. 16 56 01. 2+38.
Roger. Your time without OAMS is 16 50 40. 7+03.
Roger. Is that 16 50 40? 7+03?
Affirmative. Your attitude at 400 K should be -- on the ball -- should be 27° nose above the horizon. And this would be out the window, which would be 23°.
Roger. 23° out the window. On the ball, 27° nose up.
What are your attitudes now?
Zero, zero, zero.
Very good.
I just started to aline the platform.
Roger. Okay, Jim. What control modes are you going to use for the reentry?
Well, let's try Reentry Rate Command. I was going to do that anyway, and then I decided we couldn't do it because we didn't have the response, but since we don't need to particularly ... I'll use Reentry Rate Command.
Roger. You're going to hold roll in, or are you going to turn your roll rate gyros off?
Turn the gyro off.
Okay, fine.
Okay. You want your time to 50,000 to drogue deploy and to splash?
Roger.
Okay. 10+55 to drogue deploy, and 17+10 to splash.
Roger. How about main chute?
We don't have that one yet.
Roger. 10+55 to drogue, 17+55 to splash, and standing by for chute.
In case you don't get your complete OAMS burn, advance your retrofire time by 2 seconds for each second that you're short of your OAMS burn.
Only 2 seconds?
Roger. Two for one.
Okay. It used to be three for one. What happened?
No, it never was, Jim.
It was about a week ago.
This is a new week.
Yes. Remember this is delta time now, not delta velocity.
Roger.
On your checklist, when you pulled your drogue pins, did you pull your seat pins also?
Roger. We weren't there yet. We'll get them, though.
Do you have everything stowed?
Yes. We've got everything stowed as well as we can stow it.
Okay. The weather in your recovery area is scattered clouds, you've got 10 knots of wind and 4-foot waves. It couldn't be better.
Roger.
Okay. The doctors want to talk to you here just a second.
Okay.
Jim? Both of you are in real good shape at the present time and all the EKG's look just fine. Your water intake has come up real well and from my last computation here, both of you appear to be really well hydrated for the reentry. I'd like to make sure that both of you feel completely rested. Is that affirmed?
Oh, we're a little tired, but we're as rested as we can be.
All right, Jim. Do you feel that there's any need for item bravo?
Negative.
Negative. Okay. I'd like to review with you this blood pressure. You are not going to have the adapter on until after you're on the water. Ed already has it on, and we can tell from the data. He's to get one blood pressure after retro, one on the chute before bridle, one after bridle, and then both of you every 15 minutes in the water. Affirm?
Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon. Do you read?
I got that Surgeon. We remember what they are.
Gemini 4, this is Houston Surgeon.
Go ahead Houston Surgeon. I got your message there.
Roger. Okay. The other thing is the post-landing. We still - just to reaffirm - you would like no more than that 1 hour in the spacecraft. Get your suits off, at your discretion, if the spacecraft has no leak. The open hatch part is strictly your decision. It looks good in the recovery area at the present time for this. Remember the pumping exercise that we did at the time of the physical, and the feet up would be the preferable way. Are there any questions about this at all?
No questions.
Roger. We'll look forward to seeing you on the Carrier, then. Surgeon out.
Okay. When are you coming on, Chuck?
This afternoon, Jim. Hope to be there shortly after you are.
Okay.
Is there anything else we can do for you, or is there anything else that you want, Jim?
Yes, my computer.
I wish I had an answer for that.
What did you say?
You'd only have to compare it with my performance.
You're unbeatable, Chris. I just unplugged it.
Roger.
Hey, Jim?
Yes.
John just wanted to remind you that the toughest part comes after you get back to the States.
I've been resting my arm.
Better rest your voice, too. BERMUDA
Listen, I just won't shave. I'm so pretty now nobody will like me again.
That doesn't bother. Just don't take a bath.
I thought those fumes before were bad!
Say again.
I thought those fumes around 24 hours were bad! You ought to be up here now!
Roger.
I'm going to run the tape continuous from now on. Let's put another one in here. I got one in there now and one later.
I'm not going ...
I'm all squared away over here.
Got your seat pin out?
I never put it in.
Okay, ...
Jim. Could you give me your last cabin humidity reading that you took?
Roger. I took one about an hour ago. Just before I stowed the stuff, and I just took one right in the middle of the cabin, and it was 75 or 78 and 62 wet. It hasn't gained appreciably since take-off.
Roger.
... since take-off.
Roger.
Okay, Ed babe, I'm going to start the -- heck, what did I do with my glove? Here they are, here.
I'm going to start suiting up.
Okay. You got an hour and twenty to go.
Hour and twenty?
Jim?
Roger.
We'll be losing you in about 2 minutes here. Hawaii will get your OAMS burn, and Guaymas will count you down to retrofire.
Okay.
Hey, let's pick up a good ...
...
And as near as we can tell your IMU is in good shape down here.
Yes, it looks good up here, too.
Let's get a good Greenwich Mean Time update, too.
Gus, can you give us the Greenwich Mean Time?
Say again?
Give you G.m.t. at 15:35.
Roger.
30 seconds to go.
Your TR is very good.
Roger.
20 seconds.
How many?
I don't know, a couple.
15:35 on my mark.
MARK!
Roger. I'd like to know when it's 15 35 30.
Roger.
20 seconds.
Make that 32.
Okay.
15 35 32, my mark.
MARK!
Roger. thank you.
Ed, will you get this for me, please?
Yes sir ...
Do you want them tight?
Just like they are. No, they are all right now.
Oh!
Just pull them down.
Got an extra one here.
Okay. Thank you.
Where is my other glove?
You didn't stow it, did you?
Did you find it?
No, I didn't. Here it is! Ha!
I didn't figure it could have gone too far.
Would you fix this one for me, too?
Thank you.
Roger.
... really got ...
It seems funny to be sitting back down this low again.
You really sit right up there, don't you?
Yes.
Let's see if I eject. I'm going out with this thing -- up in here, Jim. Because it'll hang up otherwise.
Ed, just flick it. We'll be on our backs.
That's why ...
Give me that gun, Jim.
Why?
I'll put it in its bag.
I can make it all right, I think.
Well, why don't you just put it right in here. It'll be - contain itself. Anything loose like that you have no way to control.
Yes, you're right.
I'm going to just leave the food bags down here, though.
Yes, I'm going to put the food bags in my side thing. Oh, give me that ...
This you mean?
No, the extra meal. We had an extra meal.
Yes.
Here.
Here it is.
I'm going to put it all in here.
Hey, it's not going to be like - we're going to be surprised by ejecting - I don't believe so.
No.
We're going to see the chute or aren't we? If we don't, then we know right away that we got to go. I'll plan on you pulling the handle though, and I'll just hold this strap.
Okay. I'll pull the handle.
Okay. We ought to start thinking seriously about really doing the checklist.
Okay.
You got your helmet tied on tight so in case you couldn't pressurize. Got your suit all squared away so it ...
...
Yes.
Is it checking right?
Only think I lack is this thing across my knees.
Your glove.
Yes, I'm not going to put that on yet.
I don't even know if I'm going to put mine on. Oh, I guess I'd better.
There's no reason why you shouldn't.
Anytime. Anytime.
Finally found them?
Yes.
Are they really?
Okay. Go into ORBIT RATE. Okay, now, you've got to plot out the ...
... time?
Yes.
Well, I've just got to multiply it by two, Jim, and a second short.
Okay.
Or just take a second short and multiply it by two, and that ...
I mean turn the light ... Are the gyros on?
I'll be with you in 1 minute.
Okay. Yes, why don't you eat that one and then we'll ...
Case off.
Check that. Go to RATE COMMAND.
Boy, that mother's really a tight RATE COMMAND.
Tight deadband?
Wow!
Is that my book or your book?
Your book.
I'll put it in my pocket, Jim, if you want me to.
Okay. Turn MSC-1 on.
That's on the checklist, isn't it?
Yes.
Go ahead.
All right.
Okay. Let me finish going over the egress.
And I splash curtain install, neck dam install, Cabin Air Recirc handle UP. Left Snorkel handle UP, Cabin Vent handle UP. Hatch Release trigger aloof. Verify the Water Seal is DOWN and closed. Attach the lanyard, left hatch open. Stow Command Pilot survival gear over right side of spaceship. Whole recovery loop ... right side of the spacecraft. What you do is move to the left seat with your survival kit. Throw the Pilot's survival gear on the left hatch over the recovery loop. Inflate the Mae West, be sure it's on the right side of the spacecraft. I break a Pilot ... up to you. You'll remove your survival gear from the left hatch and close and lock the hatch. And you attach the right ... That's the last thing in the world that I want to be doing out there -- fooling around in the water.
I agree.
Can I give you a hand there?
No, go ahead. I'm just checking.
Okay. Let me -- I'll go through the -- no, I'll wait for you.
If you're waiting, maybe -- no, ...
Okay.
... thing in there?
No. Ha! Ha!
You can't forget it.
I go with them off most of the time anyhow.
Almost got it, Ed.
Which one?
The middle one.
The tight one?
The middle.
We've only got two.
Well, let's try that one. Took one off.
The middle one ...
Well, we're about ready to come down, Edward.
I think we are.
It's been very pleasant on occasion, and unpleasant on other occasions, for the last 4 days.
Yes. We've had some exciting moments.
Yes.
Well, I guess I might as well close my mike. Boy, is it beat up. Look at it.
Yes, so is mine. I bet mine's worse. We've got a pre-retro checklist dump.
Okay, here. Stow this away, and we'll go through the Preretro Checklist and we'll do it for real. No skips.
No skipping ...
I wonder how ... Ha! Ha!
Okay. AC Power, IGS. It's on.
... for the Pilot.
ACME Bias Power, on PRIMARY.
Attitude Light Switch breaker is ON.
Attitude Indicator With FDI.
With FDI.
MDU power is OFF.
Attitude Indicator, with FDI.
With FDI.
Computer Power, ON?
Computer Power's ON.
Yes.
Oh, computer to CATCH-UP.
No, just leave it in PRELAUNCH.
Okay. Platform alining. It's alined, isn't it?
It's already alined.
Scanner's PRIMARY.
PRIMARY.
Rate Gyros, PRIMARY.
PRIMARY.
Equipment stowed?
Stowed as best as can be.
Stowage vents are open. Drogue pins are out.
Stowage vents are open and drogue pins are out.
Rog. Survival lanyard. Yours connected. Mine connected. All right, then. My harness and lap belt.
That's your harness and your belt, aren't they?
Yes.
Got your shoulder harness now?
Yes. Secondary O<sub>2</sub>, OPEN.
My Secondary O<sub>2</sub> is OPEN.
You're sure ...
...
Okay, I'm putting the new tape in.
We're going to run out before we get there.
Okay. I'll hold this and put it in later.
Okay. Elbow support on your side. Unstowed.
Yes.
Sequence Lights Test -- AMBER -- GREEN -- then RED.
... okay.
Verify all your Circuit Breakers are CLOSED. You're still fooling with that T<sub>R</sub>-5.
No, I'm just putting it ON.
Verify attitude would indicate with FDI. Attitude Indicator, with FDI.
With FDI.
Retro Power, ARM.
Retro Power's ARM.
Retro Power RCS, PUSH.
Got them all. Good.
Retro Power, OFF.
Retro Power, SAFE. OAMS Power, OFF.
OFF.
Attitude Control RATE COMMAND.
RATE COMMAND.
Test rings A and B.
They're firing, aren't they?
Yes.
Looks a lot looser this time.
Check them both?
Yes, what's the matter? Okay.
Did they have return?
Yes.
Okay. Did they all check? - you don't like one of them?
Let me go to DIRECT.
Let me make sure that you're in PRIMARY here.
Getting a lot of yaw with my -- I think we got one of the Ring B thrusters off.
Which one, Jim? Are you getting some yaw with the pitch?
Yes, I get some yaw with the pitch.
You ought to get roll though.
Yes, but the yaw one is taking it out.
Yes.
... giving you roll?
Did you put that in?
Yes, I put that in.
Okay. I guess it's okay.
Okay. Attitude Control, HORIZON SCAN.
Let's see, you want to go back OFF on these, don't we?
Yes, I'm sorry, put those OFF. OAMS Power Attitude Thrusters are both good. A is reading 3000. B is reading about 2700. The temperatures are a little over 60 in each one. About 70 in A ...
No, that's 2400.
That's right, that's right, that's right. 2500 in A -- a little under 2500. B is about 2350.
Seems like we don't have much left all of a sudden, though, doesn't it?
Event Timer in STANDBY.
STANDBY.
All set for 36.
36.
Okay. All overhead circuit breakers are CLOSED.
Both coolant pumps are ON. Suit fans are both ON. HF transmitting receivers on Reentry. New audio mode is on HF. We're not going to be able to do that. Leave it on RECORD. ... Push-to-talk. No. 2 Audio-HF.
Let's stay in RECORD for a while.
Okay.
Oops! The checklist doesn't want to stay there.
Okay. We checked our thrusters already.
We actually made Thruster Check about 16:04.
I don't know what we're in that anyhow.
Now each can listen without being able to talk ...
What do you think of the night retro?
It's for the birds.
It's not a bad horizon though.
No.
If you had a little moon, you'd be all right.
I guess you could get down. Ha! Ha!
My gloves don't feel right.
You haven't had them on.
No, that wire's really gouging me in the hand. I wonder -- if I bend them.
Are you sure you haven't got this too tight?
No, it was really bad before I tightened that up.
You might go through a few ... gyrations.
Okay. We're going to go to CAGE now.
Yes.
Okay. What do we do at T<sub>R</sub>-30 seconds?
We checklist then.
You've got to start your timers going on a hack from Carnarvon. Then go through and aline the platform again. Get your Controller and stuff out.
... pick up early. I don't want to get seasick.
I don't either.
Hey, you got a couple up there you probably ought to get out of there.
Okay.
You all right?
Start your burn. It's 16 44 01.
16 44 01. All right.
Retro time 16 56 01 or minus 12.
2+40 is OAMS Retro. Right? Is it not?
How are we going to handle that clock time? Are you going to countdown for me?
Yes.
I'll just fly away, and then when we get down to 2:30, you give me a mark when we've been gone through 30 minutes.
I'll talk to you just as we go along. I'll give you a mark at 1-2-30-20-10 and count. Okay?
Okay. Why don't you give me a mark at the end of a minute.
Yes.
At the end of 2 minutes, then start counting down from 30 when I've got 30 seconds to go. Tell me 30 seconds, 20 seconds, 10 seconds, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
That's exactly what I said. That's good.
I just wanted to make sure that that's what you said.
Right. Okay.
After so many clocks that we've been talking about.
How long is it to RET? To 400 K? 2+38? Seems awfully short.
Yes.
You sure you're looking at the right one?
Positive.
Okay.
We've had lot of them read up to us that short.
Yes, I guess we did. But none of them were over there. The OAMS retro is always a lot shorter.
Oh, yes. You're down.
Don't let me retrofire at 16°. Remember, it's 30°.
Okay.
There's something about the amount of fuel that I have shown on my quantity gage, and the amount of retrofire that we got here, that just doesn't figure out.
It should be higher.
Yes, it looks like it. No, I mean on my OAMS propellant.
Oh, you mean -- you mean--
Quantity reading.
Yes, you mean you feel we're going to burnout short.
Yes.
... 42 percent. About 100 -- 120 pounds showing. That doesn't allow any cushion. Well, if we burn, out short, that means we're going to overshoot - long. So we can adjust our retrofire time forward 2 sec/sec.
Hey, you want to get a few things dead ahead. You're not going to use your FDI scale, are you? Want to set it on HIGH?
No, I'm going to use in on LOW for rate for the OAMS retrofire.
Okay.
Ed ...
You're going to fly ACME. Right?
Going to fly ACME.
Okay. And if you holler, I'll give you a different one.
Yes, and I'm going to fly roll gyros in all three?
Right, and I'll be watching when --
You knock off the roll if it looks as though I need it.
That sure was a peculiar way that thing was firing out there. I was getting those yaw jets everytime I fired pitch.
You didn't do that in DIRECT, did you?
No, I didn't. Yes, I still got them in DIRECT.
Did you?
I turned the roll off. No, I turned the roll off and just used pitch.
Gemini 4, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Roger, Carnarvon, Gemini 4. We're reading you loud and clear.
Roger. Read you loud and clear. How are you doing with your Pre-Retro Checklist?
The Pre-Retro Checklist is complete.
Roger. I would like to give you a G.m.t. time hack at 16 17 00.
Roger. 16 17 00.
Roger. About 30 seconds from now.
Okay. Give me a mark at 30.
MARK!
Okay.
Okay. We show your RCS readings ... You're looking good here.
Roger.
I've got some times for you. Got a pencil and paper ready to copy?
Ready?
Ready.
You say you're ready?
Roger. We're ready.
Begin blackout 5+23. End blackout 9+21. 50 K feet, 10+55. Main chute 12+33. Splash 17+10.
Get them all?
Right.
Okay. We've got those times. Thank you.
Roger.
Don't you want to go ahead and verify the 240?
Set up your Event Timer for 36 minutes and in about 2 and 1/2 minutes I'll give you a mark to countdown.
All right. Will you verify GMTRC for 63-1?
Okay. 63-1 with maneuver, 16 56 01. 63-1 without maneuver 16 50 40.
Well, what we need --
...
Did you want anything else?
Okay, roger. Could you give me the time to start rolling 400,000 feet?
Okay. With maneuver 2+38. Without maneuver 7+03.
Roger. Thank you.
Roger.
Are you ready to check your thrusters 9 and 10?
I've already checked my thrusters 9 and 10.
Okay. Are they very good?
Roger. Both good.
Okay.
You want to check that?
What?
You want to check that. Oh, you're just going to leave that for them.
Yes.
Okay.
Smell that ammonia again, Ed?
Do you?
Okay. Have you got your Event Timer all set up?
All set at 36 minutes.
Okay, in about 30 seconds I'll give you a countdown.
5,4,3,2,1. MARK!
Roger. Counting down.
Okay. Very good.
Okay. Got your Event Timer counting down.
Yes.
Attitude Control, DIRECT, or whatever you are going to do?
Yes.
FDM, Rate.
Yes.
FDI, LOW?
Yes.
Maneuver Controller, UNSTOWED?
I think that's okay. Go ahead. Reading now ...
Yes. I'm just going to go right down the list. OAMS Power, MANEUVER and ATTITUDE.
Right.
Spacecraft 0-90-0. Okay. We didn't do that before. No sweat. All right, we completed that.
Right.
Okay. Check operation of aft firing thrusters. Spacecraft is 0-80-0. OAMS Power, ATTITUDE.
Yes.
Attitude Control, HORIZON SCAN.
I'm alining. Go ahead.
FDR, PLATFORM. FDM, ATTITUDE.
Right.
Platform blunt-end-forward. Are you sure you want ATTITUDE on there, Jim?
Yes, I'm alining the platform. Go ahead.
Okay.
The Attitude Control, PULSE.
PULSE.
Null FDI's to aline platform.
Right. Nulling FDI's to aline platform. That's what I'm doing now.
Okay. You're ahead of the checklist.
Right.
Now, no ground update.
Where did we end up with the OAMS Power, Maneuver, OAMS Power Switch? MANEUVER and ATTITUDE is in ATTITUDE.
It's in ATTITUDE and you'll get it at the minus 13.
Okay.
Okay. We're good now until minus 22.
All righty. What happens at minus 22?
Platform blunt-end-forward. Attitude Control, PULSE, null FDI's (Ha! Ha!) and aline platform.
Is there anything else you want up there, Gemini?
Negative. Well, I do still need my computer, but I can't think of any way to bring it up.
Yes, I know what you mean.
Okay, now till minus 13, there's nothing to do except you get that platform alined.
I'll buy you a new one.
Okay.
I'm going to go back and re-verify the whole stuff we've done.
Okay. Very good.
Okay. When I finish this, I'll put a new tape in.
Okay.
We're going to have the most alined platform in the world. We will have been alined for an hour. We'll probably come out of the darkness facing sideways.
Yes, that'll be a shock.
Hey, Ed, you know we always said that we were going to make an open loop reentry. I'm much happier that the computer failed and not the ...
Yes, I'd rather be that way.
At least we have an attitude reference for retrofire and all the other operations. Hey, did we turn our batteries ON?
No, they don't come on yet. They come on down here right in the minus 13.
You have a minute.
Temperature is not coming down much.
No.
Wonder why we don't have the cabin fan ON.
Wonder if that's not on here.
Did you go off the checklist?
Yes.
The batteries will come on the T<sub>R</sub>-5 checklist.
All right. I guess we don't have to worry about venting the ECS O<sub>2</sub> anymore, do we? Ha! Ha!
No.
You have your Secondary O<sub>2</sub> on too, don't you?
Yes, mine's been on the whole flight.
Very good.
Hm! Hm! ... circuit breakers on ...
No, I've been very sedate.
I don't feel like I can strain as much as I used to be able to.
Right now, you mean.
Yes. Do you?
No. I feel pooped out.
I tell you, I don't feel like straining anymore.
Yes.
You feel that way, too?
Yes, I feel completely fatigued. Yes ...
No, it's not a fatigue, I don't know --
It's a very funny feeling ...
I can't quite put my finger on it.
The new tape for the retro is tape no. 15, and I've got tape no. 14 loose and I'll put it -
Hey, in case you didn't ... the neck dam. I got two of them.
Yes. Okay, I did too.
As a matter of fact, so do you.
Right.
Do you have two of them in that suit?
Yes.
How many did you have in the other one? Two in that one, too?
I think I only had one in there.
I'm going to pop my ears.
Ears popped.
Roger.
You're not going to pop yours, are you?
No, I just cleared them. They're clear.
We ... to clear them like that.
Ha! Ha!
Okay. Let's just go through our procedures a little bit.
T<sub>R</sub>-5. What are you going to do?
I've got a checklist to complete.
Okay. What is it?
I'm going to start the G.m.t. stopwatch per your time hack. I've already done about half of it. I'm going to put the Main Batteries ON. Verify RCS Propellant A and B -- ON.
I'll verify that now. I'll check it again, but -
Okay.
Antenna Select to REENTRY, and it's already on REENTRY. Propellant gage RCS-B, and I've already set it to B. Quantity, OFF. Quantity is OFF. Indicate Retro Attitude, and I'll ... I guess you've got to have something on over there for me to do that, though.
I've (illegible) have something (illegible) Retro Power. Remember we've always had that thing out of order.
Yes. Okay.
Let's put that Retro Power thing at T<sub>R</sub>-5 for you to do.
Okay.
Okay. I'll hit Indicate Retro Attitude, Sections 1 and 2 Power Control-OFF. Then you have some things: Platform-ORBIT RATE, FDR-PLATFORM, FDM-RATE, FDI Scale-High. Verify Rate Gyros-PRIMARY. I've already done this. Attitude-RATE COMMAND.
You're in PULSE now.
RCS Power A and B-ACME, OAMS Power OFF, OAMS Propellant - OFF. Control spacecraft to 0, 180 and -30. We're at minus 180 but not minus 30 yet.
Right.
At that time you'll put the Retro Power to ARM, but we're going to move that up to the beginning so I can indicate retro attitude.
Okay.
Right.
Then you'll report the minus 5 completed.
Okay.
Okay. At that time I'll turn the Transmitter-Receiver HF OFF. No. 2 -- RECORD. We should state that. Now at minus 1 I'll push OAMS, ELECTRIC and ADAPT. OAMS, ELECTRIC and ADAPT.
Not too fast.
No. We want to listen carefully so we can tell our good buddies about it.
Roger.
Okay, at minus 30 you will arm the squibs-up and at minus 10 seconds. I go to the AUTO RETRO and I'll -- no, we won't even use that.
No. We'll do it, though --
Let the ...
Okay.
I'll manually fire. We're not going to use auto retros, are we?
No.
No, we are too.
They can still run -- I don't know whether they got the load in or not. Did he say they had the load in?
Yes.
TRS will fire them.
TRS is working all right.
Okay. He said that.
I'll delay that a little bit. Ha! Ha!
Yes. Delay it till about 5. How about that?
Yes. Okay. I'll put that on at minus 5, and I'll fire on the time -- on the count of zero. No delay on that time.
Nope.
Put you to FREE here, and I'll watch with bated breath as we fire our retro rockets.
Yes. Don't forget to put me to FREE, because we might not -- you know, it may not go.
I've been putting you to FREE as a regular thing -- on all training. After retrofire monitor yaw, check Comp Light-ON. We don't have that Platform-FREE. Okay, I'll have that.
Report to Guaymas numbers of retros, IVI readings, estimated -- all you're going to have to do is report the number and the attitude.
Good.
Okay. After retros, ES sensor-OFF. We have a RET checklist to go through. Do you want me to go through that now?
Yes. Jettison Retro if you want to.
Yes, the Retro Jettison ARM first. Jettison Retro. Report Jettison retros to Guaymas. Retro Power-SAFE, Retro Jet-SAFE, Retro Squibs-SAFE. FDR -- might as well leave that on ATTITUDE.
No. I'm going to leave it on RATE.
ATTITUDE or COMP-? You going to leave it on PLATFORM?
PLATFORM or COMPUTER. Yes, I'll leave it on PLATFORM.
Yes. Right.
You're going to leave it on RATE too, aren't you?
Yes.
The FDI will be on LOW.
Okay.
The attitude control -- you going to use Rate Command or Reentry Rate Command?
Reentry Rate Command.
Okay. We're coming up on 22 minutes.
Okay, aline your platform.
Ha! Ha! Look, we've driven the temperature down to 55 in here!
Now we'll suddenly start swimming, huh?
You read the times off, because you have a good hack around that area.
Next thing we do is at 13. Right?
Right.
Okay. And that should be at 16 43 01. 22+9 minutes.
It looks like we're still right-side-up out there.
Boy, I really smell that ammonia.
Do you?
No, I don't. Jim, let me tell you something.
It has something to do with wetting your pants, doesn't it?
No, this is about the strongest I've ever smelled it. We really screwed up when we went with this padding here. I wonder if -- gee, look there at the cabin vent.
Okay. I'll review a few times -- for you.
Okay.
The time to 400,000 K will be 2+38.
Right.
Blackout will commence at 2+38.
Blackout at 2:23.
5+23. Correction.
5+23. Okay.
And ends at 9+21.
Okay.
50 K and drogue is 10+55.
Okay.
Main chute at 12+33.
Okay.
Landing is 17+10.
Okay. You'll have to call those out to me again when we get going.
Yes. I've got them all written here.
Okay. We're at 18:30 minutes.
And you give me a mark when you start the burn.
Right.
We'll probably get a countdown from the ground, too. We'll have a multiplicity of countdowns.
None of which will probably agree in some respects.
Yes.
Oh, here's your ...
Right.
That's for really only -- that's the important one there.
Right.
And if you should get hurting somewhere in there, let me know.
Okay.
I'll just say, "you've got it."
Yes.
Wonder if Paul Haney has the crowd worked up to a frenzy. Ha! Ha!
I don't know.
Come on now. Let's not be burping.
I'm thinking about the food.
Ha! Ha!
Ah, the sun's coming up.
Okay. I'll recheck all the switches again.
Very good, old boy.
All on?
Got some brilliant fireflies out there. Boy, there is one of them that is really pretty.
Yes, I see them
16 minutes.
Retrofire - retrofire's more fun than launch. You know nothing's going to stop it - it just counts down.
Yes. That's right.
In launch you have to be concerned about whether the gantry is going down.
What about that gantry?
Shades of MA-9!
Same thing here too, in a way -- losing the computer.
Yes.
The way Gordo lost the ...
Where did I have that?
Boy, I don't have any reference. Do you?
No.
I have fireflies.
This would be a tough retro --
Oh boy!
... time to retro, wouldn't it?
You couldn't see anything.
15 minutes from now.
Okay. We've got 3 minutes till our burn.
Start giving a T<sub>R</sub>-13 checklist at 14.
Okay.
Start Comp. You don't need to do that.
You've got another minute.
Oh, okay.
I've got to wee-wee.
Shoot. I'm going to have the best alined platform we've ever had in the whole world.
Gemini 4, Hawaii CAP COM.
Hello Hawaii, Gemini 4.
Roger. Are you in attitude for your OAMS burn?
I am.
Roger. I will give you a 5 second countdown to start of OAMS burn.
Roger.
Stand by, and I will stand by for a mark on completion of OAMS burn from you.
Roger.
Okay, Edward. Let's go through the 14 minute -- 13 minute checklist.
Okay. Start Comp-PUSH. Platform-ORBIT RATE. Attitude-RATE COMMAND. You're in PULSE.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger. Maneuver Controller-UNSTOWED.
UNSTOWED.
OAMS Power-MANEUVER and ATTITUDE.
MANEUVER and ATTITUIE.
FDM-RATE.
RATE.
0, 180, 0.
0, 180, 0.
You're in good shape.
You'll burn at 15 34 01, counting on your timer, and we'll get a countdown, I guess.
I'll still give you some talk.
Right.
Unless they're bothering us so I can't.
No, he said they're going to stand by for my mark.
Okay.
Okay, I'll tell you when we've got a minute.
Thirteen on my mark.
MARK!
Right.
Okay, you ready?
I'm ready.
2 minutes and 40 seconds.
How much?
30 seconds to OAMS burn, Gemini 4.
Roger.
Look at that firefly sparkling.
Yes. It is.
Okay, 15 seconds.
I'm going to put pressure in the line.
5,4,3,2,1. MARK! Start burn.
Okay. I've got a good hack.
Attitudes are holding smoothly.
Coming up on 1 minute.
Thank you.
Now.
Thank you.
... grinding away.
Yes.
You're coming - you're coming up on 2 minutes.
MARK!
Got 10 percent of fuel left.
Roger.
You're coming up on 30 seconds.
We're standing by for your mark, Gemini 4.
Roger.
20 seconds.
10 seconds.
5,4,3,2,1,0
MARK!
Good show!
How about that?
Roger, Gemini 4. How were your attitudes during your firing?
They were within about a degree.
Roger. Roger.
Okay, IVI. ... OAMS fire attitude.
OAMS fire attitude.
Maneuver control is STOW.
You looked good here on the ground.
Stow.
FDR-PLATFORM.
PLATFORM.
FDM -- it says ATTITUDE. You probably want RATE, don't you?
RATE. Well, let's go aline the platform some more.
Attitude Control PULSE -- Yep. Blunt-end-forward.
Null FDI's to aline platform computer REENTRY. Okay.
I'll be standing by for the minus 5.
It's showing about 3 percent fuel remaining.
Okay.
Now, if that conversion table was right, we got the first part down exactly right.
Oh, by the way, I checked it and compared with ... table.
It shows about 1100.
Roger.
Gemini 4, Hawaii, stand by for an 8 minute mark to retrofire.
1 - MARK!
Roger, got your mark.
... T<sub>R</sub>-5 and -6. Okay.
Okay.
Some of it anyway.
Yes, well, I can't do much of it, Jim.
Okay.
I didn't want to put the main batteries on. All you do there is ORBIT RATE, platform FDM RATE, FDI scale HIGH. Go to RATE COMMAND. ACME. OAMS OFF. And go to minus 30.
Right.
Now I'm going to ask for Retro Power ARM right after minus 5.
Okay.
I don't know why I'm doing all this in the Platform Alining mode. It's not really good.
Let's see. You've got a minute and 30 seconds to minus 5, right?
Yes, on my mark. MARK!
Okay, I'm half a second from you. I think I can't sweat that.
You can't have everything, Ed.
Well, we got somebody's OAMS retro. I'm not sure any more whose that is.
I don't know who owns the OAMS retro these days.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Right.
I see little things floating along with us Ed.
Yes.
Hey! I noticed them going the other way the other night.
Yes, so did I. They were going forward.
I was small-end-forward, and they were going forward.
Okay, 5:44.
Right.
Everything you want to go on RETRO POWER. Right?
That's right. At 5, I'm going to start this thing right up here, and then give me RETRO POWER.
You want me to give you a mark?
No, I've got mine right here. I'll get from that ... We're coming up on ...
15. MARK!
Right.
Okay, we'll be right on time RETRO POWER ...
Okay.
Is ARM.
Retro Power is ARM. My Greenwich watch has stopped. The main batteries are coming on. Verify RCS propellant A and B are ON.
Rog.
Indicate - Indicate Retro Attitude has been PUSHED. Sections 1, 2, 3, ... are all ... We're on the Main Batteries. And the buses ... all look good. Platform, ORBIT RATE.

Go to minus 30.
Okay, we're all set.
Report to Guaymas that we've got it.
You want to report a minus 5 complete, Jim?
Minus 5 checklist is complete.
Kind of bright, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
Okay, we've got all the lights on.
Hey, Ed, does that go off?
No, it doesn't. It goes off later on. I don't see why we leave it on though, do you?
No.
Scanners, OFF.
Trans -- HF is OFF now, and I'm on RECORD and have been on RECORD.
Okay, I'm going to reverify the checklist. I'll be standing by on your Roll Gyro.
Roger.
Looks right on in attitude here, look out the window.
Looks good, Jim.
Those mothers really fire, don't they?
Yes, they really jerk you.
Your deadband is not as tight as it was.
It is for roll and pitch.
Okay, we're at 2:18.
Roger.
If you feel there's something wrong with that RCS, holler, and I'll put you in the DIRECT.
Okay, very good.
Gemini 4, Guaymas CAP COM.
Roger, Guaymas. Gemini 4. T<sub>R</sub>-5 Checklist is complete.
Roger. I'll give you a mark at 1 minute 30 seconds.
Roger.
All you have to do, Jim, is to fire and fly her through.
And I'll call for you -- arming your switch.
Okay.
That's all I got to do, ARM the Squibs, right?
Yessir.
3,2,1 MARK!
Roger. Right on.
Doesn't the RCS propellant firing look good?
Yes.
Just a sec.
Okay, stand by.
Got the ... Got the adapter. There is no question about it.
No question about it. The old adapter's gone.
Gemini 4, would you confirm adapter sep?
Adapter sep., no doubt.
We have adapter sep.
Okay. Stand by to arm your squibs.
Roger.
Arm your squibs.
1,2,3,4.
I think that thing's counting a little early, Jim.
Okay.
I'm going to fire it by manually.
How come we've got a yellow -- oh, that's right. We're supposed to have ...
Jim.
What?
I'll fire it on their MARK. I think that timing's early.
Go ahead and arm it.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, -- retrofire!
It fired a second early.
We're home, buddy.
Gemini 4, do you confirm all retros fired?
All retros fired auto. They seem to be a minute before -- a second before your countdown. Attitude probably was within about a degree or so.
Roger.
Okay, Retro Jett, ARM. It was a nice show, Jim.
Retro Jett, PUSH.
I take it, Eddie, Babe.
Yes.
You got it?
There it goes!
Looka there! Hey, there's the pump package! Ha! Ha! I see it!
Did you?
Retro sep., and Ed says he sees a pump package. Ha! Ha!
Do you confirm retros sep?
Sep, and Ed says he sees the pump package, Ha! Ha!
Say again.
Retros sep, and Ed says he saw the pump package.
Roger.
Give John a pat on the back.
Okay. Retro POWER is SAFE.
Retro Jett, SAFE.
Retro Jett, SAFE.
Retro Squibs, SAFE.
Retro Squibs, SAFE.
FDR. Leave it on PLATFORM. Leave it on RATE. FDI is on LOW. You want it on LOW or HIGH, Jim?
I want it on HIGH.
Okay. Attitude Control, REENTRY RATE COMMAND, Scanner is OFF. Roll Rate gyros are all ON. Tighten and lock restraint harnesses. Hatch pawls in neutral.
We're not in neutral, check yours.
Mine are in neutral.
Mine were in LOCK where they should have been.
Okay, Cabin Fan ON. ECS O<sub>2</sub> heater is OFF. Platform, FREE ... thruster is OFF. Check and lock restraint harness. Hatch pawls should be neutral.
Okay, let's see.
Gemini 4, Guaymas. I can give you a mark at T<sub>R</sub>+3 minutes.
Okay.
If you don't have it, I can give it to you anytime. We make these at anytime.
We make these mistakes all the time, huh?
Right.
Okay, I'm going to have it in just a minute here.
Give it plenty of ...
Yes, I can. You have 30 seconds to go.
We'll have to put the roll in shortly.
The first blood pressure came disconnected. I'm pumping it up again.
Stand by for a mark at T<sub>R</sub>+3 minutes.
MARK! 3 minutes.
Got that, Jim.
Right.
I've got a blood pressure for them.
Ed has a blood pressure.
Okay, this should be at 400 K, Jim
I know it.
Starting the roll.
Yes.
Okay.
I started my roll about 30 seconds ago.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Roger. You started your rolling reentry?
Yes, I have.
Roger.
Okay, Jim. We're going to have blackout here in ...
Your weather is still very good, Jim.
Okay.
About 2 1/2 minutes till blackout, Jim.
There goes the adapter -- the retro adapter.
Where?
See the antenna even. Even the antenna sticking up.
Ah! I see it!
Say again.
We just saw the retro adapter go by. It even had the antenna sticking out.
Very good.
I can see all those four nice rockets in there.
Probably go into blackout in about another minute, Jim.
Okay.
Hey, tell the Doc I'll get an extra one for bonus points.
Okay.
Get ready for the (illegible) Hawaii.
The call words of the carriers in the area are Sinclair and of the airplanes are Inkspots.
Sinclair and Inkspots. Roger.
Okay, at 100,000 feet we get the Landing Arm ON. One thousand, get the High Altitude Drogue.
That's affirmative.
Feeling great, how about you?
Okay.
It looks like it may be 11 or 12 miles short, Jim. Very good.
Okay. I'm sold.
Hey, look at it burning up, Jim.
There goes the adapter. It's burning.
Look at us, we're making fire, too.
Yes, were putting out ionization layer. They're not reading us anymore now, probably.
Look at the adapter burn up!
Yes.
Not any doubt about those retros firing, is there?
Gemini. Gemini 4. That last distance is wrong. You're probably about 40 or 50 miles short.
They seem to fire longer though, than I thought they would. I guess you're waiting for them.
Yes.
Makes a nice kind of pinkish-orange cast. The fire around it, doesn't it.
Yes.
Okay, there's a Reentry Rate Command coming up.
The g's are starting to build.
I don't have ammonia yet. ...
It sure is. Look, you can see - looks like three things coming together out there. Cones of fire for some reason.
Like pieces of rock, isn't it?
Yes. There goes Florida. Is that Florida?
I believe it is. See it on your side?
Yes, here comes the g's.
Okay. Next thing to look for is 100 K. Sit back and relax. We aren't going to do much about it from here out.
No. A lot better than the centrifuge.
Yes, I see a little bit of a green in that - I guess that it's just the sun reflecting. Now here they come. Is that 3?
No, we haven't gotten any on the indicator yet.
Oh, I thought you said we already had some.
Well, I thought we did. The back part was on... it sort of settled down ...
See the green in the ...
You know, it's not as much as fire as I thought there'd be.
No, there isn't. Yes, there is green, isn't there?
Ah, there comes the g's.
Yes, the g meter's not working.
Okay.
Milt says the g meter isn't working, and I agree.
I think we've got now about 5 g's. Wouldn't you say so?
Yes, it's only gone up to 2 right now.
You know, it's kind of nice to have some g's back again.
Yes, it is.
It's making me dizzy going around in circles. Look at paint coming off my window.
Yes. Now we're really getting a little more layer.
There's 3 g's now.
Okay, I guess it's right.
Yes.
Boy, these RCS thrusters in yaw are firing an awful lot.
Five.
They're red hot, Jim.
Yes.
Six.
Seven.
You can take, old buddy.
You're right, it is. Isn't it? ...
There's 100,000.
Why don't you ...
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
... the fire.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
I'm reading you loud and clear. How me?
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Okay.
We're climbing back up again, it says now.
Four g's.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. We'll have a helo over you by the time you're on the water.
Go ahead, Houston. Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. We should have a helo over you by the time you're on the water. His call sign will be Sinclair 52.
... 52. Roger.
Roger. What is your altitude now?
We're going through 82. The g's are down to about 2. Landing Arm's ON.
Say again.
I said the Landing Arm is ON.
Okay. What's our altitude?
Say again altitude.
We're coming up on 50.
Gemini 4, I missed that last transmission, but you should be coming on drogue chute deploy in another 20 seconds.
Okay.
Got the drogue out, Jim?
No, not yet. I'm waiting for 40,000.
Landing bus armed?
Okay. The Landing Bus is Armed. Isn't it?
Got the drogue?
I'm coming on with the drogue now.
Okay. We're starting to oscillate. The drogue caught it.
Gemini 4, you should have drogue by now.
We've got the drogue out now.
About 40° oscillation.
Whang, whang, whang. - Okay.
Let's go to RATE COMMAND.
Rog.
Pretty good oscillation, old buddy.
Yes. It is, isn't it?
Yes, the Rate Command doesn't seem to - Ah! Dampened it out.
Okay, we're at 28,000, Ed.
Okay, I can see the drogue up there, too.
We got a good drogue. It's holding fine.
23.
Okay.
Let me see if the drogue is going to hold it by itself.
I've got one of your arm rests. Get your D-ring.
Okay.
Get your D-ring out, Jim.
Roger. ... coming off. Have I got it?
Yes.
I guess I should get our D-ring out, shouldn't I?
Huh? Right.
Okay, 16,000.
Okay, I'm in a position to eject, if necessary.
Okay, Ed. Let's hope we don't have to.
Roger, Cape Control. We're just about ready to put the parachute out. Stand by.
Okay, parachute's coming.
See it?
I don't see it yet.
Yes, I see it.
It looks good, Ed, babe.
Right in the sun. I can't see it.
Looks good.
Good chute.
There's the de-reef.
And it's a good one, isn't it?
Nobody can read me now, but does that parachute look great!
Gemini 4, you should be coming upon main chute deploy.
You're not kidding!
Okay, take your blood pressure quickly.
All right.
We're at 6000 ...
Ah, shoot. It came out.
Did it come out?
Yes. Stand by.
Hurry up, we can't wait too much longer.
This is the important one for them though.
I know it, I know it.
How do you feel? I feel great.
I felt kind of funny during the spinning.
I was dizzy during ...
I was, too. Okay, it's coming out now.
Coming out now?
Oh, no, no, no! Don't go yet.
Okay.
Ready?
No.
Come on, I'm not going to wait past 5000.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM, Do you read?
Okay, just a minute. Make sure it goes all the way down.
Okay, you ready?
We're at 5000 on my mark.
2, 1, MARK!
That wasn't so bad.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM.
Couple of broken arms, and you're all right.
Okay.
Gemini 4, here. We're right-side up. Two point on the parachute, and everything's fine.
Roger. Understand. Everything is fine. We should have a helo to you in about 5 or 10 minutes after you're on the water.
Okay. Don't let them wait too long. I want to get rescued in a hurry. Tell Doc Berry we got a blood pressure.
Okay, D-ring covered.
Take another one, too.
Yes. D-ring?
D-ring covered. We don't want that one out.
No.
How you feeling, Ed?
I feel good. How about you?
So do I. I feel great.
Feel like a tiger. Feel like I could eat him up.
Feel a little warm. Let's see.
Okay.
Cabin temperature's only 55. Suits are 70.
Say again, Jim.
The cabin temperature is only 55. The suits are up to about 70.
Our poor spacecraft's all burned up.
Roger. Both of you feeling okay?
Yes, we're both feeling great, Gus.
Good.
Clean the electrical switches out, Jim, while I sit here.
Okay. Let me get them.
I've got the Rescue Beacon ON already.
Rog.
Let us know as soon as you're on the water.
Hey, we got some weather ...
Okay, the heater's OFF. You got it? Good RCS.
How are you feeling, Ed?
I feel good.
Hey, there goes the R & R can off to one side.
Say again.
The R & R can is floating down with us.
You're coming in a little garbled. Try to talk slower.
Our R & R can is coming down right next to us.
We can't reach you, Jim, you're fading out too much.
Okay, we're at 1000 feet, Ed.
Okay.
Now get ready. Remember water.
I'll stand by. Water seal. Let's go down -
Oh! Okay. The R & R can is floating by.
Let's go down now. Okay, you get the Inlet Snorkel UP when we hit.
When we hit. I'm standing by on it.
I'll jettison the parachute.
Get ready for arrival.
Roger. We got 300 feet.
300 feet.
As John says, how do you get ready for the arrival?
We figure you ought to be touching down in about 20 seconds.
Roger, we're indicating 100 feet right now.
Pretty good impact. Okay. Jettison the chute.
Chute's gone.
Yes, and your inlet snorkel's UP.
Okay, let's see if we're leaking.
Yes, but are we leaking? That's the big thing.
No, I don't think we're fuming. I don't hear any gurgling.
Okay.
Whoo! I smell something, but I don't think it's bad. Gee, I feel great!
So do I, Ed! That wasn't too bad!
Yes, buddy. Good show!
Okay, let's finish up the checklist.
Let's clean every switch up in this mother.
Gemini 4's on the water, and we're floating fine. No leaks.
I smell a little of that stuff.
Yes.
Oh, are our sea dye markers out?
Let's see. You got the Rescue Beacon ON?
Yes. I put that on right away.
Put it on with the light if they're that close.
Okay.
Gemini 4, Houston CAP COM. How do you read?
Okay, let's go to HF.
Okay.
Ye-hoo!
Okay, let me give you this one, Jim.
Don't you have one over there, really?
Yeah, it's packed with garbage on top of it. It really stinks in here, doesn't it? Let's go to O<sub>2</sub> High Rate, you want to? Get some fresh air?
Yes.
What's the matter? O<sub>2</sub> High Rate doesn't come on. I guess we must have all the lights off ...
Negative, Omnibus.
Roger, read you 5 square, Omnibus.
Hello, Omnibus ... Gemini 4.
Gemini 4, Houston.
You're coming through five square, and you're sounding great. There's nothing you can do but pull us out.
Well, what alternatives do we have right now?
Roger, can you put the collar on us with the helo?
Can you put the collar on us with the helo?
Roger. We'd like to come out with the collar and with the helo.
Listen, we'd better get those.
Gemini 4, Houston. You're about 40 to 50 miles from the aircraft carrier.
Gemini 4, this is Omnibus 64. Your rescue helo is coming in to put the collar on for you now. Over.
Coming now, Roger. Roger. Roger.
The Peek-a-boo would like to know the condition of you two. Are you both in good shape?
We're both in excellent shape. That's affirmative.
Roger! Roger!
Gemini 4. The doctors would like to know if you're going to return in your space suits or not. Over.
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
Ignition!
Lift-Off! Lift-off 13 37 26! Lift-off 13 37 26!
Oh, the clock is started. It's a real one!
Roll commence on time.
Roll complete.
Pitch is tracking.
Cabin pressure relieving.
Our altitude's building up a little bit.
It's only 1 g.
MARK. 50 seconds.
Yes.
Cabin pressure sealed at 5.5.
Roger.
What's cabin pressure, Gemini VI?
Air pressure looks good.
Roger. Tracking real good.
Roger.
There was a slight yaw correction. Looks good.
Roger, Wally.
MARK. 1 plus 40.
Roger. Mode 2.
Roger. Mode 2.
There's the DCS update.
Roger. Update.
That's about 2-1/4 g's.
Trajectory is looking real good.
Very good. I've got a good second stage.
Roger.
DCS update.
Roger. Update.
Staging.
Roger. Staging.
Switching to high rate.
Guidance Initiate must be in. It's real slim.
Roger. Guidance Initiate.
Steering looks good from here, Gemini VI.
Roger. She looks like a dream.
I saw some flash in that stage.
Roger.
Attitude errors are all zero.
Roger.
How about that! Did you read that area, Elliot? Attitude errors are zero!
Roger.
You're right down the line, Gemini VI.
Very good.
Well. Right on the mark (horizon on 8-ball).
She'll start winding up now.
Yes, it's only about 2.
 --
You're GO from here, Gemini VI.
Roger. You got a big fat GO from us. It looks great!
Roger, Wally.
Attitude errors are still zero.
Good show.
Didn't copy that, Tom.
 ...
Yes.
Yes. Now she's winding up a little bit - about 4 g.
Stand by for Point 8.
Roger.
MARK. Point 8. V over VR.
Roger. Point 8. Mode 3.
Thirty 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

... for Attitude on, Wally. Standing by to separate spacecraft.
Okay.
We started at 39. We'll burn at 59. She looks real stable here.
Beautiful!
... separation.
Gemini VI. You are GO.
Good velocity. 25,710.
Separating.
Okay sep. That's good. ... command.
Very good.
And jett fairings, Wally.
Okay.
Fairings are gone.
Am I in Rate Command?
You're in Rate Command.
Okay.
Okay. We're here.
Attitude is 72. 25,730.
Gemini VI, your 1-Alpha time is 17 plus 02 and I copy your insertion.
Roger. 17 02. Everything looks great here.
It's great!
Standing by for IVI's.
Okay. How about caging me up?
Okay. Roger. Going to CAGE SEF.
Okay.
CAGE SEF.
Okay. I'll give you the IVI's. They're 11 forward, 2 right, 2 down.
Copy. 11 forward, 2 right, 2 down.
That's affirmative.
Okay ...
 Okay, let's go on SEF again.
Roger.
Okay.
Oh, what a beautiful insertion!
Positive gamma too, Wally?
Say again.
Gemini VI, your orbit is 87 by 141. More tracking coming.
That's great! Very good!
Okay, we also see some little white stuff that is around us. They're little white specks.
Roger.
Let me get the squibs off and we're all set.
Let's put this in Plat Mode and regroup. Okay?
That sounds like a good idea.
Good. I'll give him a call on these addresses. We'll finish things up.
Okay.
Houston, Gemini VI. Ready to copy addresses?
Go ahead.
Roger. Address 72, 25729; Address 94, 00025; Address 97, 00011; Address 52, Minus 00000; Address 73, 03015. Everything looks real nominal.
Roger, Tom. Copied them all.
Post-insertion check list. Going to get the ...
Gemini VI. Check your voice recorder off.
Batteries are up.
Roger. It's off, Elliot. We're minding DCS platform mode primary scanner. All my squibs are off.
Roger. And did you get his interfering?
Sure didn't. They left us with not much choice once we pressed that button.
Roger.
Elliot ... there's no doubt about lift-off.
Roger, Gemini VI.
... more comfortable now.
Roger.
Things are looking very good at primary. We'll check secondary probably after LOS.
Roger.
All control modes are very good.
Roger, Tom. Roger, Wally.
Okay. I do have a little smoke at my window. I hope there's not any danger in the ...
Roger.
Gemini VI, your GMT LO is 13 37 26.
For the record, the acceleration g for entrance into orbit is 6.8 g's.
Gemini VI, Canary CAP COM. How do you read? Over.
Gemini VI. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Read you loud and clear.
We have a Bermuda vector for you. You're 87 by 140, requiring an Out-of-Plane Maneuver and a Height Adjustment.
Roger. Understand 87 by 140, which will require and Out-of-Plane and Height Adjustment.
What sort of out-of-plane velocity did we have at ignition?
Stand by.
Okay.
... You ready to copy, Canary?
Go ahead.
We are reading now 60 per second forward, 22 left and 4 down.
Roger. Copy.
... Change communication. We may have had an out-of-plane.
Okay.
Calculated out-of-plane approximately 31 feet per second.
Okay. Thank you.
Roger. All systems are GO on the ground.
Roger. We are the same shape here.
That was a beautiful launch we had and we're ticking right along.
Good to hear that.
How are the VII boys up here?
Say again.
How are the VII boys doing? Did they go over awhile ago?
They sure did. They're about 5 minutes ahead of you.
Roger. Tell them ...
Okay.
Whenever you're ready, VI, we'll check communications.
Go ahead.
Roger. Give me a call on the adapter UHF Set Number 1. Do you read?
Roger. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Read the same.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Canary. You read on UHF 1?
That's affirmative. We're now on secondary scanner ... due to pump it HF shortly.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Houston. How do you read?
Gemini VI, Houston CAP COM. How do you read?
This is Gemini VI. ...
Roger. Read you loud and clear. Sounds like we've got good communication.
Roger. ... where ... UHF ...
Roger, VI.
Returning to primary scanner at 34 minutes. Warming up time about 30 seconds. We'll give it 2 minutes for a good chance.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Houston. How do you read?
... Elliot, I read you loud and clear. How me?
Roger. You're weak but very clear. It's getting better. Would you confirm radiator to FLOW, adapter C-Band to CONTINUOUS and reentry C-Band to COMMAND?
Roger. Your radiator is now FLOW. Stand by. A C-Band OFF. ... still max flow - still a little warm in here ... We have C - reentry to COMMAND; adapter beacon to CONTINUOUS. Over.
Roger, Gemini VI.
... VII.
Did not copy your last transmission, VI.
... Gemini VI.
Go ahead, VI.
Roger. Both heaters checked out normal ...
Say again, VI. You're weak and a little bit garbled.
Roger. Both primary and secondary scanners are looking very well.
Understand both primary and secondary scanners are looking good.
Our suit temperature has gone down about 1 degree.
Roger. Suit temperature has gone down 1 degree.
Carnarvon CAP COM, Gemini VI. Do you read? Over.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon CAP COM. Read you loud and clear.
Roger. The ... fire six and nine ... Mark.
Roger. Copy.
Looks like you've got some pretty heavy thunderstorms down that way.
That's affirmative, VI. We have you GO on your radiator.
Roger.
Turn your secondary pumps off and Operator switch to NORMAL.
Carnarvon, do you have any estimate of our out-of-plane burn?
Roger. We have an update for you. We'd also like to get your GO, NO-GO readings at this time, please.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. We're ready for you.
Okay. Go ahead.
We're standing by for your readings, Gemini VI.
You must have something we don't have. You want us to give you quantities for GO.
Roger. I need your Adapter Batteries 1, 2, and 3 readings, please - voltage and current.
Roger. Adapter Battery 1 is 24.5 volts, 1A is 7.0 amps. Adapter Battery D is 24 and 6.8 amps. Number 1C is 24 and 6.9. 2A is 24 and 8.5 amps. 2B, 24 and 8.3. 2C is 24 and 9.0. Over.
Roger. We copy.
Gemini VI. We give you a GO for 17-1. Also, I have an update for you on your maneuvers. Are you ready to copy?
Roger on the GO for 17-1 and ready to copy on the ...
GET B 01 34 03; Delta-V, 13.5. Height-Adjust 02:18:02; Delta-V, 59.5. Phase-Adjust: 02:42:18; Delta-V, 31.3. Plane-Change towards the south: 03:47:36; Delta-V, 44.3. Co-elliptical: 05:16:33; Delta-V, 33.7. Terminal Phase initiate: 05:48:40; Delta-V, 42.5. Terminal Phase final. Did you copy?
Roger. We have those. We have the general ballpark. The main one we want now is the first one. Can you read that back to the Height-Adjust over the States?
We'll update you on the final Height-Adjust over Hawaii. Also, we'd like you to check on your X axis ... It's slightly out of tolerance. So don't press the START COMP until late for your Height-Adjust. We'll get a better hack on it over the States.
Roger. Understand we have a slight ... blast here. Will not push the START COMP for this until just prior to the burn.
That's affirmed.
We can see the IVI's counting up.
Roger. Would you like a time hack?
That's affirmative. We'd like a GET time hack.
All right. I'll give you a time hack. It's 57 minutes, 30 seconds.
MARK. 57 30.
Roger. We have that. At this point, we've ... and getting intermittent noise. ... We don't see one either. Okay.
Roger. Can you place your Cryo Quantity switch to the ECS O<sub>2</sub> position, please?
Roger.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon. You can turn your Cryo switch to the OFF position.
Roger. Turning off. Our PQI is 98.0 percent.
Roger on that.
We have a night airglow passing right through the moon at this time, SEF. The time was at 59 minutes, 10 seconds GET. Estimate the layer at approximately 1/2 degree. It was approximately the same thickness as the moon.
I think, at this point, you could notice that we were cleaning up the cockpit, worried about suit temp. Got it down finally at this time where we're convinced it's all right.
Okay, we'll fold on that. Recorder off.
Gemini VI, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead, Hawaii.
How are you doing up there this morning?
Very good. Nice to be up here.
Good to have you up there. We're showing you GO here on the ground, and what's your status?
We have completed GO. The suit temperature has come under control very nicely. I'll give you a reading.
Go ahead.
It's now about 67 degrees and we're comfortable. Just a minute.
Okay. Will you turn your secondary pumps off? Over.
Secondaries off.
Okay. We've got that. Stand by. What is your cabin temperature?
... cabin temperature is 90 degrees.
Roger, 90. I've got your Height-Adjust information. Are you ready to copy?
Ready to copy.
GET B 01 34 02; Delta-V, 14.0; your burn time, 0 plus 24; yaw 180, pitch 0; Core 25, 00140; Cores 26 and 27 are all zeros. Your forward thrusters for maneuver will be posigrade. This is your Height-Adjust.
Roger. For the Height-Adjust that's GET, 01 plus 34 plus 02; Delta-V, 14.0; duration, 0 plus 24; yaw 180 degrees, pitch 0; Core 25, 00140; 26 and 27, all zeros; forward-firing thrusters, posigrade maneuvers.
Okay. You got all that right.
VI, Hawaii.
VI, go.
Okay. We'll be standing by if you need anything else. Can we help you now?
Positive. Apparently all the sunrises are going to be on Tom's side but you can't fix that.
Okay. Say that again. I couldn't read you too well.
Roger. Apparently all the sunrises are going to be on Tom Stafford's side but you can't - you can't fix that.
Okay. Very good. They'll update your bias after you complete your burn over the States.
Very good. We'll start easing it off ... shortly.
Roger. Understand. Will be standing by.
Roger. Thank you. Out.
Okay, recorder off.
Gemini VI, Houston. How do you read?
Gemini VI, Houston. How do you read?
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Houston CAP COM. How do you read?
...
Gemini VI. You are fading in and out. Try again.
Roger, Houston. You're ... You're coming in clearer now. How do you read me?
Roger. Read you clear now. We're standing by for your burn. Advise this is a UHF 6 pass.
Roger, Elliot. We are ... first burn in ... mode ... adjust alining ... certainly looks beautiful.
Roger. We're standing by for your burn, VI.
Guaymas. This is VI ... bias on this burn. ... just before burn time.
Roger. And after your burn - when you are completed with it - we plan to update your accelerometer bias. We'll contact you after the burn.
Okay.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini VI. Is VII talking to you? We can hear something down here, very normal.
Negative. They are not talking to us at the present time.
I'm sure reading someone's transmission, and it's very normal.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Houston. You're coming up on 1 minute to the burn.
MARK.
Roger. We're right with you.
This is Gemini VI, coming up on the first Height-Adjust burn, recording. Over. Burn will be at 1 hour, 34 minutes and 2 seconds. 14 feet per second aft.
And the Gulf Coast is socked in.
See that? (IVI's)
What?
Switched.
Okay.
It's on.
Stand by.
... MARK. Burning.
MARK. Burn complete.
Okay.
Okay.
82.
Down 2, Wally. Okay.
Okay.
That's one ... Let me try 81.
Okay.
... 80 00 04. Okay. Back a little more.
Okay. Forward.
Blip it just a little more.
That's got it.
Our residuals are zero. Propellant quantity remaining is 87.5.
Understand 87.5. Is that correct?
That is for quantity reading. Correct.
Roger. Ready for you to go computer PRELAUNCH now so we can update your accelerometer bias.
Roger. Thank you. All systems are ...
Say again your last transmission, VI.
I say all systems are performing beautifully.
Roger. Your UHF transmissions are slightly garbled, Wally. You might try adjusting your mike.
Have a red object that was trailing us. Just after the Height-Adjust burn. Apparently drifting aft. Definitely has red color to it. It's not a foreign object. It's obviously part of the spacecraft.
Hey, there's the moon again!
Dropping off record at 37 minutes, 25 seconds.
MARK.
Gemini VI, did you receive that update?
That's affirmative.
Roger.
We're having a lot of trouble with ... burn.
Gemini VI. Whatever you did to your mike, do something different. You're worse now.
How do you read me now, Elliot?
That's much better.
Okay. What I said is ... to keep me straight but the Gulf Coast is off-line.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Houston, We're complete with your accelerometer bias update. You can go back to PRELAUNCH and - correction - back to CATCH-UP and we suggest you rerun your accelerometer bias check yourself.
Gemini VI. Okay.
I have a node update when you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Node 01 12 08; Rev 1; 179 degrees west; 08 hours, 28 minutes, 42 seconds, right ascension. Do you copy?
Roger. ... that is 01 12 08; Rev 1; 179 degrees west; 08:28:42, right ascension. Do you have the time of our next burn?
It hasn't changed from the summary maneuver that Carnarvon gave you, Tom. Do you have that, or do you want me to give you that again?
You speak rather fast. I'm not sure yet.
Okay. It is 2 18 02 for Catch-up.
Roger. 2 plus 18 plus 02.
Roger. And that will be a Delta-V of 59.5. We'll update you on it.
Roger on the Delta-V update. Thank you.
Gemini VI, Houston.
Go ahead, Houston.
We'd like you to go to START COMP at this time so we can check your accelerometers while you are still in contact here.
Roger.
START COMP.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Houston.
Go, Houston.
We have lost a multiplexer and we are unable to read out several temperatures here on the ground. Like to advise you of that. These are cabin temperature, left suit tap, right suit tap, and log range rate - and that's all.
Okay. We're going right now to SEF and we're starting to get all our camera gear out.
Roger.
Gemini VI. Do you still read Houston?
Roger, Houston. Gemini VI reads you loud and clear.
Roger. I have an update on your Catch-up burn.
Gemini VI. Go ahead.
GET of the burn 2 17 59; Delta-V, 63.4; burn time, 1 plus 20; yaw 0, pitch 0; Core 25, 00634; Cores 26 and 27, all zeros; aft thrusters, maneuver, Posigrade. Do you copy?
Roger, Houston. For the Height-Adjust, the GET is now 2 plus 17 plus 59; Delta-V, 63.4; duration, 1 plus 20; yaw 0, pitch 0; Core 25, 00634; 26 is 0; 27 is 0; aft thrusters, Posigrade Maneuver.
Roger. And that's your Catch-up Maneuver.
Gemini VI, Houston CAP COM. How do you read?
...
Roger. I have a slight change in your Catch-up Maneuver update when you are ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Okay. GET of the burn 2 18 00; Delta-V, 60.8; duration, 1 plus 17; Core 25, 00608; everything else the same. Do you copy?
GET is 2 plus 20 plus 00; the Delta-V is 60.8; ... duration is 1 plus 17; Core 25 is 00608.
Roger. I don't believe you got the GET of the burn right. It is 2:18:00. Do you copy?
2 plus 18 plus 00.
That is affirmative.
Gemini VI, for your information, the accelerometer bias check we made here was very good.
... Roger.
Houston CAP COM, Gemini VI. We read you loud and clear through all those transmissions.
Roger, Gemini VI. Very good.
We heard them give one reading which was the fuel quantity of 16 percent and that was the last we heard.
Roger. Very good, VI.
I've got something in sight at 12 o'clock. It is a star.
I've got it. Okay, Wally, the next thing - -
Gemini VI, Houston. Were you copying Gemini VII's answers?
Only one answer; that was the first answer of 16 percent fuel quantity.
Roger. We plan for that to get better.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Houston. If you read, we're standing by for your burn and counting down. We have 4 minutes and 52 seconds.
Roger. Standing by.
... Houston. We have our ... in view.
Say again, VI. You have what in view
Our pressure suit patch in view.
Gemini VI, we did not understand that last transmission.
Roger. We have Gemini VI emblem patch in view.
Roger. We copy.
MARK.
One minute to burn.
Continuous intercom. Push START COMP at 2 17 30. Simpler to catch up burn.
What about OAMS?
That's what we got just from platform. I checked all the addresses.
Okay.
Want to take them out?
They're slowly working in and out; we'll just have to wait till the end.
Let's see if we can hear these dudes.
Okay.
3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Burn.
And we're moving.
I can feel that acceleration.
I can feel acceleration.
50 seconds gone.
Roger.
MARK. 1 minute gone.
Roger.
Stand by for stop burn.
3, 2, 1.
MARK.
Roger. 1 minute and 16 seconds. Stand by to trim them out.
We have some big down and some big left.
Yes.
Okay. Go down about 3.
3.
A little more down, Wally. That's fine.
Okay. Let me check it again.
That's great. 0 on 82. 81.
To the right?
1.9 right.
You want to take that?
A little more right. Seven-tenths.
Six-tenths. A little more right.
Isn't that cute?
I didn't see it.
Okay, that should have it. We're crossed over. That's one-tenth.
Take out aft?
Aft. Okay, I'll tell you how much. 80. Aft 2.5.
Keep coming. Hold it. 09. Should have it.
Let me check again.
Just a foot back.
There you go.
That's it. 01.
Propellant quantity remaining with the zero residuals on 80, 81, 82 is 79 percent.
Okay. We ought to dig out that world chart  .
Yes, I've got that.
You have got that?
You've got that over on your side.
I'm sorry.
Okay. The next one is the Plane-Change.
Yes.
Okay. What were the numbers for this thing? (Orbital Path Display).
Okay.
Okay. Rev 1; 179 degrees west.
179 west.
Yes ...
Stand by.
Okay.
Okay. It's Rev 1 and a GET of 01 12. That's close enough. We don't need the seconds.
01.
12. 1 hour and 12 minutes.
Okay. I got it.
Okay. The other one was --
I don't need that yet.
Yes.
The star, you mean?
8 hours and 29 minutes for all practical purposes. Right.
We should have taped this.
Yes.
That's beautiful.
Okay. Now at 1 hour and 32 minutes. Are we 1 hour or --?
Oh yes. Yes.
2 hours. Okay.
We're about 1 hour and 10 minutes past that.
1 hour and 10 minutes?
Yes.
Okay.
So look 1 hour and 10 minutes further on there. That's about right - down about in here.
Right here.
There we go. Coming up to Carnarvon shortly.
12 minutes we'll be in Carnarvon.
Minute plus 22.
The cabin pressure's 4.9. Still looks good.
Oh.
How's our suit temp here, Wally?
About 67, 68. 
Okay. Let's leave them on (Two pumps). Say, we need some velcro on this, if you get a chance.
All right.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Hello, Carnarvon. Gemini VI here.
Roger. Do you have any information to report to us from the Phasing Maneuver?
Roger. Good burn. No residuals. Propellant quantity remaining is about 79 percent.
Roger. Copy you burnt all residual; propellant quantity remaining 79 percent.
That's affirmative.
Roger. There will be another Height-Adjust Maneuver which will take place over the States on this next pass. You will be updated over Hawaii.
Roger. Understand. Update over Hawaii. (Height-Adjust.)
Ask him - -
Roger. I have your Plane-Change information, if you are ready to copy.
Roger. Send this one up a little slower this time.
You ready?
You want to hold that for me?
Carnarvon, Gemini VI. Ready to copy.
Roger.
... 0317; thrusters, aft; maneuver, south. Do you copy?
Roger, Carnarvon. For the Plane-Change. At a GET of the burn: 02 plus 42 plus 07; Delta-V, 31.7; duration, 0 plus 40 seconds; yaw, right 90 degrees, pitch 00; Core 25, 26, 0; Core 27, 90317; aft thrusters, maneuver south.
Roger. And would you check to make sure that your T/M switch is in REAL-TIME ACQ-AID?
Roger. REAL-TIME and ACQ.
Oh, here comes the moon. A bright orange.
Oh.
Okay, I'm taking care of this problem over here.
Okay. This is a 2 42, Wally.
What's the time?
02 42 07.
Say it again. 02?
02 42 07.
What is that?
That's our Plane-Change. 31.7 feet per second.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go, Carnarvon.
Roger. Would you leave your T/M switch in the REAL-TIME ACQ-AID position until the completion of rendezvous please?
Roger. Leave it to REAL-TIME and ACQ until completing the rendezvous. It must have inadvertently gotten knocked off.
Roger.
Noise in one can at 2 hours and 35 minutes. You mean we have 7 minutes yet?
Yes.
Do you hear something?
No, not a thing. Try HF here.
Okay, Wally. We've got 37.
Yes.
42 07.
Okay. Let's go around.
Orb rate.
Pulse. I'll go ahead and catch up. I'll have to start computer after we get there.
Hello there, Alpha and Beta Centauri and the Southern Cross.
Yes.
Look at that lightning! I've got really lots of it down here.
Okay.
See those stars?
Yes. I have - right there we go zero yaw. We're going to have Alpha and Beta Centauri right on the nose!
Yes.
Okay. Again let me recheck it and then we'll reset it.
Okay. There's 40. Now reset.
There's 41.
Okay. 42 right?
42 07, Wally.
Okay.
We are in Continuous Record. Going to catch up at 41:30.
Just want to warm it up a little better here.
Okay, we have about 30 seconds to go on this.
40.
Okay. Start comp.
Okay.
Rate Command.
Standing by to time burn. At 42 07.
42 07 is the time.
Stand by.
MARK.
30 seconds gone.
Burn complete.
Right on 40 seconds.
Beautiful!
Okay. 82.
Okay. Down just a little bit.
That brings it up to two-tenths. That's good enough, I'd say, for now. Get it one more down.
Good. One-tenth on 82. 81.
Two-tenths to the left.
Good. That's down to one. 80.
Good. 80 is zero.
Roger. Zero.
Residuals on the burn were 80 - were all zeros. 81 at one-tenth and 82 at one-tenth, almost.
Fuel remaining is 74 percent.
Good.
We had 79 to start.
Roger.
Boy, that rate command's a delight!
Okay. Record off.
SEF aline. SEF aline at 2 hours, 46 minutes and we completed the Plane-Change burn.
What's our next event?
Our next event is co-elliptical.
What time is that?
Okay. He gave us an early one at 3 plus 47, so it's nearly an hour.
Okay.
This is the time to get our final gear squared away.
Yes. I'll go to plat mode. That's what I was getting at.
Right. Okay. Boy that's nice to wait till the transition's over and - -
Well, we're still going to have some fuel left.
Yes.
Our source pressure's still real good. OAMS source - I'll record that.
Gemini VI, Hawaii CAP COM.
Hawaii, Gemini VI. Go.
How are you doing up there?
Very good. Completed the Plane-Change burn. No residuals. The fuel remaining is 75 percent.
Okay. You burned out all residuals and the fuel remaining is 75 percent.
That's affirm. We are now back to SEF aline.
Okay. If you get too warm, you can turn on your secondary loop if you like.
Want to do that?
Roger. We're back to one fan. I think we will turn on the secondary loop.
Okay. Will you turn your ECS O<sub>2</sub> heater off?
Okay.
Roger.
You've got enough heat to maintain pressure. And I've got this Height-Adjust here if you would like to copy it. It's a tweak burn.
Secondary loop.
Roger.
Secondary loop on and - -
Roger. We'll give it a tweak.
Okay. We copy your pump is on. The GET B 03:03:19; Delta-V, 0.8; your burn time, zero plus 01; yaw and pitch are zero; Core 25, 00008; Cores 26 and 27 are zeros; use your aft thrusters; the maneuver is Posigrade.
Roger. Copied for the Height-Adjust GET of burn, 03 plus 03 plus 19; Delta-V, 0.8, duration, 0 plus 01; yaw 00, pitch 00; Core 25, 00008; 26 and 27, all zeros; aft thrusters, Posigrade Maneuver.
You got that all right. We're in good shape.
We'll send them.
You have your filter down there if you want it.
I think I'll just put on the sun glasses.
Yes.
I'm going into HORIZ SCAN.
Okay.
VI, Hawaii. Do you need anything else?
VI, negative. We're just watching the sun come up.
Roger. Your cohort is doing real fine also.
Very good. We haven't heard him since - quite a long time ago.
Okay.
Have they heard us yet?
I'll give them a call. Stand by.
VI, Hawaii.
No joy. Could not read them.
Okay. The next time around you'll probably be reading them loud and clear.
Very good.
We'll be standing by if you need anything.
Tell him to stay right where he's going.
Say again.
Just tell him to keep going where he's going.
He'll be there when you get there.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Houston. Standing by for your burn.
Roger. About 3 minutes to go now.
Roger.
... how about giving me a GET hack just to see how this clock is holding up?
Did you say GET or GMT?
GET.
GET. Roger. We have 3 plus 00.
MARK, 20 seconds.
Okay and then a Greenwich Mean Time.
Roger. Coming up on 16 37 - correction - 16 38 00.
MARK.
Did you copy, VI?
Roger. We got that.
Give me a Mark on 39 there, will you?
Roger.
And we're sinking the GMT to the test in 40 seconds.
Roger.
Coming up on 16 39 00.
MARK.
Roger.
The timer gained 40 seconds so we reset it.
Roger, VI.
Going to Continuous Record. GET 3 hours, 2 minutes and 15 seconds.
Coming up on 1 minute to burn.
MARK.
Roger.
At ...
We're in catch-up mode.
You can throw it in.
Yes. Okay.
Oh, okay.
I'll push the button. Since it's only eight-tenths, I don't want it to build up. I'll push it at 03, which will give us 19 seconds.
Okay.
Getting a 19. Right?
Right.
Forward.
Stand by for burn.
MARK.
MARK. One-tenth, one-tenth.
Nice tweak.
Giving a residual of one-tenth.
Good guess.
Okay. Let's go to Horizon Scan. Orbit Rate.
Roger.
We're in Orb Rate, Horizon Scan.
Roger.
We have a flight plan update when you're ready to copy, VI.
Go ahead, Elliot.
Stand by.
Test rendezvous. You will obtain Spacecraft VII acquisition at 03:05:00; yaw 0, pitch 5.5 degrees up; time of 248 nautical miles, 03:15:00. Do you copy?
Roger. For the test rendezvous with Spacecraft VII at 03:05:00: yaw 0, pitch 5.5; 248 nautical miles; 03 plus 15 plus 00.
Roger. And of course that's pitch up. Also have a node update. Node at 05:39:41: Rev 4; 112.2 degrees east; 08:22:57, right ascension. Spacecraft VII sunrise 05:49:21. Do you copy?
Radar go on yet?
Roger. Give me the times for the Revolution 4 there, the start of it.
The time for Rev 4 - the node update - the time is 05:39:41.
Roger. That's 05 plus 39 plus 41; Rev 4; 112.2 degrees east; 08:22 plus 57, right ascension; and the sunrise at 05:12.
That's 05 49 21.
I'm sorry. 05 49 plus 21.
Roger.
Well, we should be going ahead and getting this radar on then.
I have it on.
You have it on? I have to get the breaker on, then.
Okay. ...
Okay.
Gemini VI, your accelerometer bias still looks very good.
Gemini VI. Roger.
Very good. ...
Radar on at 05.
What time is NSR?
Okay. About 47. About 40 minutes to go.
Okay.
Gemini VI, going over to VII for a few minutes. We'll be back to you with - probably have an update here for you shortly.
Roger. Standing by.
We should have a lock in 15 minutes?
Yes. That's when I should be able to read out the range on the MDIU.
Okay, we're all set. Want to go to OPERATE on radar and see what we have?
Would sorta like to!
Me too.
It blinked a couple times.
See it.
Better give them a call on it. We should have a lock-on right away.
What?
We should have a lock-on right away.
Leave it alone.
It's cycling now.
Radar and attitude.
What?
Radar and attitude.
We have to have lock light.
Okay.
I get it out at the max range, 248.66.
What?
Pointed up about a couple of degrees. (Radar elevation needle.)
Yes.
Haven't had a lock-on yet, Tom.
Yes, I know it.
Why don't we call them and tell them? We should be locked on by now plenty good.
When's the co-elliptic burn?
3 plus 47. That's a ballpark. He will have an update for us on it.
Bring it back to STANDBY for a while.
Okay.
Well, I don't know - -
Why don't we give them a call?
There are the islands.
Yes. Yes, I got - -
Houston, is Gemini VII up on the transponder at this point?
Is VII up on the transponder at this point?
Does Gemini VII have their transponder on?
Say again, VI.
And they are BEF. Is that correct?
Does Gemini VII have their transponder on?
That's affirmative.
And they ought to be up. Is that correct?
Roger.
Did you copy them?
I heard a Roger, I believe.
Only the Roger, I believe.
That's right. He said Roger.
...
There goes our recorder. (Two-minute warning light.)
Okay, we don't have a lock yet. Plan for me to get one shortly.
Roger.
Stabilized.
Recorder just run out?
Yes.
Gemini VI, Houston. We wonder if your suit temperature has improved since we went to the secondary coolant?
Affirm. It's down to about 62 now.
Roger.
Houston, we're getting lights on the radar but no lock in yet.
Gemini VI, Houston. Have your NSR update if you're ready to copy.
Stand by.
Gemini VI. Ready to copy.
Roger. GET of the burn 3 47 37; Delta-V, 42.9; burn time, 54 seconds; yaw 0, pitch-down 3 degrees; Core 25, 00429; Core 26, 00023; Core 27, zeros; thrusters, aft; maneuvers, Posigrade down. Do you copy?
Roger. For the NSR maneuver GET of burn, 03 plus 47 plus 37; Delta-VT, 42.9; duration, 54 seconds; yaw 0, pitch-down 3 degrees; Core 25, 00429; 26, 00023; 27, all zeros; thruster, aft; maneuver, Posigrade down.
That's affirmative, Gemini VI.
Gemini VI, Houston. How do you read?
Gemini VI. Go.
Have a slight update on your last maneuver. Are you ready to copy?
Go ahead.
The Delta-V is 42.5; duration, 53 seconds; yaw - correction - pitch is down 2 degrees; Core 25 is 00425; Core 26, 00011. Everything else the same. Do you copy?
Roger. For the ... of Delta-V, it's 42.5; pitch-down is now 2 degrees; Core 25 is 00425; 26 is 00011. We do have what looks like a policy drop-off load. Radar rate is decreasing as was described in the rendezvous node ...
Roger, Gemini VI. Understand radar lock-on and rendezvous test is going good. The duration is 53 seconds. Do you copy?
Roger. The duration is 53 seconds. And, again, to verify, the plan is 03 plus 47 plus 37.
That is correct.
Roger.
Gemini VI, how do you read Gemini VII now?
Loud and clear, fellows. We're looking at you.
Very good. We hear you loud and clear also.
... hang on, we'll be up there shortly.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Houston. Copy your looking at them but I assume this means radar. You do not have visual. Can you confirm that?
...
Roger.
Houston, this is Gemini VI. Our radar appears to be valid. Over.
Roger. Copy. Radar test is valid. Standing by for your burn.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Houston. Coming up on NSR burn. Mark, one minute.
Roger.
We'll stand by with 44 percent propellant quantity.
Roger.
Stand by to burn. Burning.
We're spending 16 percent to charge. The main is off.
Continuous Record. Will burn at 03 47 37. Standing by to burn.
Stand by to burn.
Did not copy, VI.
Burning.
... either.
Roger.
Burn has been completed, no residuals.
Roger. Burn complete, no residuals.
Burn-down?
I have a burn-down to about 3 and then steer it up. Okay?
Do you have your OAMS quantity?
Affirmative. It is 68 percent.
Okay.
That sound good?
Yes.
Understand 68 percent. Is that correct?
Okay. Correct.
Okay.
We're stopping 3 feet per second short to burn-off.
82. Okay. Go ahead.
2.7. Bring her down.
Roger. We have a slight correction we're making now. No problem.
Keep burning. Hold it. That's got it.
Beautiful! Okay, forward to take that out.
Forward?
Let me get 81.
Right.
Right?
Right.
Okay. How's that?
Okay. That's good. We're down to four-tenths. That's good.
Let's get the forward now.
Okay.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon.
Go. Carnarvon.
Roger. I would also like to verify that your HF whip is retracted.
We have our ... will retract.
Roger. Also, we'd like an OAMS propellant quantity, please.
Roger. 68 percent.
Roger. Copy 68 percent.
There were no residuals.
Roger. Copy.
We've had no joy with clock lights or ACQ lights at this point.
Roger. Copy.
Gemini VI. We're still about 154 miles out. Have a GET of 3 - 4 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds; our range is 154.52; new tape recorder cartridge installed; data points at 27:20; Theta, 5 degrees; R, 31.23; Delta-R is 2.59; Delta-Delta-R is minus 0.01.
Gemini VI. We're still about 154 miles out.
Roger.
Gemini VI ... 15 minutes 40 seconds after NSR, 712.
At 30 40 Theta was 5.4; range, 123.42; Delta-Delta-R was zero.
Ah.
Hawaii ... Standing by.
Say again.
... data point.
Whom am I talking to?
Gemini VI.
Okay, go ahead, VI.
Gemini VI, Hawaii CAP COM.
VI. Stand by ...
Hawaii, this is Gemini VI at 35 point 40 - 35.40. We have the data point: Theta, 6.4 degrees; range, 115.58; Delta-V total, 523; Delta-V, 924.8. Total block looks completely normal.
Hawaii, this is Gemini VI. At 35 40 we have a data point: Theta, 6.4 degrees; range, 115.58; Delta-V total, 523; Delta-VI 24.8. Data plot looks completely nominal. O4:24:32 CC  - - nominal and say again the range.
Range was 115.58.
Okay, I've copied all that. We show you GO here on the ground. How are you doing?
Very good here.
Okay, we'll be standing by.
Okay. Next data point. Here's another one.
Just call me what you have, not what you're deriving. Right?
Tom?
Yes.
Don't call out your arithmetic; just call out your addresses, that's all.
Yes. That's good.
VI, Hawaii. How do you read?
Loud and clear.
Okay.
Another point. Want to give it another try or not?
We'll wait for a minute.
Next one is 30 minutes.
Hawaii, Gemini VI. We didn't give data point ... and would like to know what kind of out-of-plane velocity do we have?
Hawaii, Gemini VI. We have your data points and, in exchange, we'd like to know what kind of out-of-plane velocity we have.
Okay, stand by one.
Roger. We'll call you.
Roger. We'll call you.
They claim VI is still showing 2-feet-per-second - 2-feet-per-second.
Next data point should be at 39?
Right. We're coming.
Hawaii, Gemini VI. New data point 6.4 degrees; 110.41 nautical miles; Delta-V total, 486.
Hawaii, Gemini VI. New data point 6.4 degrees, 110.41 nautical miles; Delta-V total, 46.
Roger. Copy.
That was NSR plus 39 - 39 minutes, 0 seconds.
I got all that.
Yes.
Hawaii, did you get an answer on the out-of-plane yet?
Outstanding! We're GO down here.
It's all up to us from now on.
40 40. Right, Wally?
Good show down there. It's all up to us from now on.
How about it?
New data point, Hawaii. Theta, 6.9; range, 107.82.
New data point, Hawaii. Theta, 6.9; range, 107.82.
I copy that.
Suit temps are coming down nicely.
Good.
Hawaii, our suit temp's about 59 degrees now. Looks real fine.
... about 59 now. Working it real fine.
Very good.
Okay ...
You put it on and you got a point ...
Okay.
Mark.
Looks like it's occluded out there. Coming back on.
Yes, we're real close on these data positions, Wally.
Good.
That Delta-Delta-R certainly is coming right down the pike.
Very good.
That'll be at 44 minutes. Right?
Right. P6  ...
45 40 GET Theta, 7.5; range, 1000.01; Delta-V total was 430; Delta-VI is 202.1; the angular variation decreased markedly at approximately - at a GET of 450.0 seconds or a total phase time of 1 hour and 2 minutes.
Gemini VI transmitting data point at 49 minutes Theta, 8.0; R, 94.82; Delta-V total, 396; Delta-VI, 185.6.
Roger VI.
How's that clockwork look to you? All right?
Your clock is looking real good. We concur with your points.
Roger. We jarred it a little bit.
... the radar needles are a little bit spongier than on ... 1 or 2 degrees.
Roger.
At this point we have so much sunlight in our eyes, we couldn't possibly see ... outside.
Roger, VI.
Both of our windows are quite badly clouded.
Roger.
New data point 50.40 Theta, 7.9; R, 92.22; Delta-V total, 376; Delta-VI, 175.1. Looks like the Control switch is working good.
Roger, Tom.
I have a Terminal Phase Back-up Maneuver when you're ready to copy.
Stand by ...
Ready to copy.
Terminal phase elapsed time 1 plus 29 plus 17; GET of the burn, 5 plus 16 plus 54; Delta-V, 33.0; duration, 41 seconds; Core 25, 00301; Core 26, 90135; Core 27, 00016; Delta-V, 32.9, 1.5, 1.5; burn time, 40 forward, 04 down, 04 left; yaw zero, pitch 26.8; range 139; range rate, 32.69. Do you copy?
Roger. Terminal phase elapsed time initiate 1 plus 29 plus 17; GET, 5 plus 16 plus 54; Delta-VT, 33.0; duration, 41 seconds; Core 25, 00301; 26, 90135; 27, 00016. Stand by - stand by and I'll call the rest of them in just a second.
Roger, Tom.
Okay - continuing on now - okay, ... 32.9; burn time, 40 seconds forward 1.5; 04 seconds up and down; Address 81, 1.5 04 seconds to the left; yaw zero, pitch 26.8 degrees; range 139; range rate 32.69. On the range and range rate, I understand that's in yards.
Range should only be about 33 miles.
Gemini VI, we've got it just backwards here. It's range 32.69 and range rate 139; and the up-down burn is down.
Roger. Up-down burn is down.
Roger.
At this one time, it would not be practical for us to either roll over or move in almost any direction to avoid sunlight where we have a bright lighted sky underneath us, bright sunlight to our right.
Roger, VI.
Approximately a range of ...
...
Theta 59 minutes plus 10.0 degrees; range, 79.25; Delta-V total was 300.
22 1 Mark ...
Stand by.
New data point Theta, 10.7; range, 76.66.
Roger, VI.
Approximately a range of ...
Data point Theta, 11.1 degrees; range, 71.48 miles.
Roger, VI.
Theta, 11.8; range 68.90; Delta-V total is 232; Delta-VI is 101.1; data point was 05:40. Data point at 09 minutes: 12.5 Theta; 63.75 in range; Delta-V total, 199; Delta-VI, 84.2. Data point 10:40: ... 13.5 Theta; 61.19 range; Delta-V total is 181; Delta-VI, 74.8. 12:20: Theta is 13.7; R, 58.63; Delta-V total is 169; Delta-VI is 69.5; Mark at 15:40: Theta is 15.5; range is 53.55; Delta-V total is 136. ... Theta, 15.5; range, 53.55.
Gemini VI, RKV CAP COM.
Go, RKV.
Roger. On your TPI, based on the States data, you'll be about 2 minutes late.
Roger.
At 14 minutes, Theta with 15.0; R, 56.09.
... elected to aline the platform for the first 5-minute period.
Theta, 15.5; range, 53.55.
I see something at 12 o'clock.
I've got so much sun I can't see a thing.
I'm wiped out.
This is Gemini VI. I have a lighted target at about 12 o'clock. It may be a star and it may be VII. We'll check her out.
Gemini VI ...
Theta, 17.0; range, 51.00.
Roger, VI.
It's right in the sun.
Hey, I think I got it! That's VII, Wally!
Negative.
Yes.
It's either Sirius or VII.
...
Mark on a target at a GET of 05 05 50
RKV, we either have Sirius or VII in sight! It's right in the middle of the reticle. Radar is locked on.
47.1 is Delta-VI; Theta, 17.0; range, 51.00.
Okay.
19 minutes range, 48.5 miles; either Sirius or Spacecraft VII is in bright view; 109 Delta-V total, 48.50; Theta is 17.7.
I do have a star in sight. It seems to be left of the object I have in sight and 10 degrees down. It looks like another bright star.
This is Gemini VI. Do you have an update on where - ... to the target?
Gemini VI, Houston. I did not copy.
An update on where the star ...
Stand by, we'll check.
Roger.
Theta, 18.4; range, 46.00.
At this time the rays of the sun are bouncing off the nose of the spacecraft, eliminating every area of it. Some bright stars are visible to the left and below. I now see the Belt of Orion. So Sirius is below our nose considerably. This is not a star I recognize.
At 20 20 19.2; range, 43.52; 85 Delta-V total.
That is correct. 85.
71. It's 30.6. That's 30.6; it's 30.6 ... Now we go a little beyond that and come back till we're right there.
Is that Alpha?
No, not yet ...
...
Now ... a target is in line through the center of Orion's Belt. Approximately the geometric center of Orion.
Right. ... point out.
This may be Point Alpha.
Right on it.
Okay. This will be at 24. Right?
Check. Coming on.
We have no - may have been a point off.
We have time. Yes.
Oh, oh. That other one may have been Point Alpha.
We'll take this one as Alpha.
I want to take this one as Alpha.
You do?
I do. Stand by. Right on it.
Right on it.
MARK.
Point ... on it ...
Good. Is that Alpha?
20.8. Right?
Good point.
... good show.
Point Alpha. 41 06. And that was it - -
24.
24 minutes. 20.8 at 41 06.
The target right on the pitch of the reticle and a half-degree to the right, so the radar needles nulled one-half degree. Better than the simulator, right?
Yes.
And he's moving and Orion isn't, so that's the target. 
We got you, Frank.
Okay.
Right on that dude, Wally! Point Bravo. Here we go!
This next one will be at 25 40. Right?
Check. Coming up.
There it is. Good point.
Coming down towards Sirius.
That's what's supposed to happen, isn't it?
Yes.
Okay. The next one will be Point Charlie.
That was 25 40, wasn't it?
Check. 27 20, Charlie.
27 20 is Charlie.
Okay.
It's 31 50.
Boy, you're sneaking right up on Sirius! Bright as Sirius too.
Yes.
You got both of them, Wally. 27 20.
Okay. ... Right on it. MARK.
Beautiful Delta-V. Push START COMP.
... Push.
Okay, I'll get 69 out of here.
27 20.
That looks good.
031 Forward. Was it right?
It was right!
It's about right. ... I'll get these data here.
Okay. Frank, the light went off here now. (Lost sunlight.) I have to turn on some ...
You were brighter than Sirius until then.
This thing's a little bit low here. I'll get the other one.
Check on the ACQ lights too.
Okay, my backup solution is 2 feet per second up, and 23 feet per second forward, which will put us in this position. We'll take a closed loop at range data point. We'll speed up the summary. It was screwed up for some reason.
27 20 - 31 50 is when we reset now.
I'll try to turn this down for you a little.
Do you log these numbers? I do need some help. (Acquiring light.)
Right - that's good.
Do you have them in sight?
Negative.
Still no. Right?
We can go a GET of the burn ... 17. He set at 16:54 ... we'll be okay.
Okay.
I'm coming up to 30 minutes. Right?
Yes. Just see little tiny dots. 30 minutes time now.
Very good.
We'll be burning shortly.
Okay.
Okay, we're coming up here, Wally. 31 minutes.
Not much upthrust left on that.
You up one minute before.
Say again.
Up was one. Down before. And one right.
Yes.
Here we are. Rate Command.
We're burning.
Okay, I've got my clock reset and counting.
Another one of the lights is on. Better check it.
Okay.
Okay, Wally.
Okay.
You just track on it from 3 to 5 minutes. I got it.
Okay.
After 5 minutes. Right? I'm going to go out on fuel Mark.
Fuel remaining is 62 percent.
How about that?
Just 400 pounds. That should do.
I imagine so.
Oh, how about time sync?
Okay, we're passing 1 minute, Wally.
...
I had my time sync right in there.
Transfer time went off pretty well, Frank. Set your clock for 2 minutes and we'll pass at about 30 degrees.
... burning are being run pretty well ...
Roger.
... in about 30 degrees, Frank.
Okay.
30 degrees. Continue to track.
20 seconds to go 2 minutes.
Okay. 20 seconds to go to 2 minutes.
We'll go for 4, Frank. For 3 minutes.
Roger. 3 minutes.
Hey, once we get right on 
You say you're pitching out at 3 degrees now?
About 3 degrees.
Right ...
About 32. It'll start increasing pretty fast now.
Got a good burn.
How does it burn?
We can't see ... I hope they're working.
I've a very dim source on that. It's probably the dock light.
We've got a very dim ... light.
Can't see any thrusting lights.
Negative ...
We've got real good radar so far, so it has good lock logic.
I have Sirius but I don't have anybody else.
He's down below us.
Okay. We have to hack for 4 minutes?
3.
Okay.
Coming up on 3 minutes, if you can make it.
... 3 minutes ...
How much?
5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Okay. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
3 minutes.
Roger. Made it.
Okay. Our data look good. Yes, we're in a little close, Wally.
...
Close?
Yes, I mean we transferred a little late because ... we played conservative.
Roger.
How's our range rate doing?
Okay. You want some of that? That's about 105. No, 155.
That's good.
Nominal's 165.
I've got a real dim light out there.
No. That's not it.
A real dim light up there ...
We'll blink it a couple times.
...
Okay. That was it.
It's off now.
Okay ...
It's coming on now.
Roger ...
And we don't have any ACQ lights ... zero.
Yes. That's what I see. (First night sighting.)
I don't want to blind you, Wally, on this thing.
Good. I'll go ahead Frank.
We've about 35 to go.
About 35 degrees.
Roger.
Got the dock light on?
...
The lights are on.
... turning dock light off.
... yet.
...
Hurry up a bit so I can aline the platform.
I have to get data.
Hey, hold it right there! Stay where you are!
...
You want me to do that or do you want me to stay where I am? I better stay where I am, I guess.
21.84.
...
38.3. Okay, you got her.
Going down. (To aline platform.)
Four.
Three.
Right on the line.
Where's our plot?
Right there.
Start getting the point. You can talk to them about that.
Yes.
Gemini VII, VI. From our plot on the data point, looks like we're right on the line. The last data point was 38 degrees at about 22 miles.
Pitching up at 10 minutes.
Yes.
Okay. I'll pitch up and look at you again, Frank.
Pitch angle ... I better stay locked on.
I got him.
Blinking?
You're blinking.
Looks like you're blinking, Frank.
Okay, that was him.
A little to the right.
About 50 degrees.
About 50 degrees, Frank.
Okay, let's get that data point.
Right on.
What do you get, Wally?
It's 7 forward, 5 left, 7 up.
5 left and 7 up. Go get him!
Up first?
Yes. You can get thrust orthogonally if you want to.
And forward last.
Yes. Up and left.
Yes.
Okay. We have to track 15 to 17.
About 55 degrees, Frank.
Affirmative. Affirmative.
He wants ... you to ...
Yes. We need a tad up.
Good.
A little below. I'll take it off the ball.
Wally, range rate, if you get a chance.
Okay. About 105 to 110.
Okay.
Good show.
Recording.
Range-rate reading 110. The attitude is approximately 55 off the ball. The range is 13.06.
Good.
Roger. About 62 degrees.
Very good.
Wally, how did it seem to track him with respect to stars on that reticle? This is just an evaluation.
My stars look pretty bleak out there.
I don't have any. There's the dock light.
You're right on it now, Frank.
Very good.
Okay. Coming up to 15 minutes.
Pretty good track. Dock light is bright as the Agena.
If you get a chance, you can get me some range-rate readings.
Less than 100. About 90 now.
Good show!
It's really bright now, isn't it? (Dock light.)
Yes.
16 minutes.
Sneaking up to meet you, Frank. Directly abeam and to the left are two stars called Castor and Pollux.
Pitch.
Ballpark pitch is about 70 degrees.
The idea is we go ...
Yes.
Boy, the dock light knocks out the ACQ lights, doesn't it?
Yes. Why don't you tell him? I'm too busy.
Frank, you're just what we thought before. Your dock light completely wipes out the ACQ lights.
Oh no, no, no! (Don't turn dock light off.)
7.77 (Range.)
Okay. Zero addresses 25, 26 and 27. That's better.
74.2. Okay. 25.
There are some stars out there. Good!
You got 19 minutes?
Coming up on 19.
Sure do. I'd get the data otherwise.
27 ...
Okay. Good show, Wally!
Do you see Castor and Pollux?
Oh, yes, I sure do.
We're going to perform the backup check.
Yes. Okay. Stand by ... Okay, you've got 3 seconds to go, Wally. 2, 1. MARK.
Got it.
We're about 10 degrees ahead of schedule but that isn't too bad. We transferred a little late ... with no sweat, Wally.
Yes.
Okay. Next data point will be at 22 minutes.
Right.
Okay. The next correction will probably be - may be a little bit up. Here it is; I have it for you on the plot. We're right there.
Oh, yes.
Here's where we transmit. We're coming right up to it.
... there are 20 minutes to go.
22 is 94.3. And that is 14.3. The total.
...
I'm going to say 60 percent up.
That's it, right?
I can't get a photo.
Oh, yes.
6 up to the back-up.
What is it?
4 forward, 5 right, 3 up.
4 forward, 5 right, 3 up.
6 right.
6.
5 right, 3 up.
Okay.
5 right.
About 110 degrees.
That's all that we should have.
Yes. That's all.
Okay. Catch-up mode, Wally.
That goes 250.
Pulse mode.
Cleared addresses 25, 26 and 27. Okay.
Is recording continuous now?
Roger.
Good.
Okay. We have a real pass. 15 on.
110 - 110 - 110 degrees, 69 is 110 degrees. 2.77.
Very good.
And give us 55.
2. We are right here. That swung us in, tight on, ... right there.
Okay.
This swung us in. Good going.
That really is great. Didn't drop at all.
That's good.
R-dot is about 45 ... Good.
Okay. At 27 minutes after ... We'll give them the pitch angle here, will you?
Okay.
115 degrees on pitch. That ball ... pitch ... That's about right.
Yes.
Does it look like they are going up?
A little bit.
... Let's leave it alone a little while.
Okay. 17 at 27, 117, 60.
How's the plot look?
2 miles. 100 - 206. May be going up a little bit on you.
No. It looks pretty good. We wish we had a parallel course.
Yes. Pretty hard to argue. Good stars there.
Okay. Good show. I'll call it out to you.
Yes.
120 degrees, 1.7 miles. We're decent now, Wally.
... 120 degrees.
...
1.7 miles.
Roger.
Coming right up.
It's not going up nor down? Or right?
Or right.
How's the range rate?
About 42.
Okay. Good show.
Okay.
It's going down a little bit, if anything.
Okay. Go ahead and stop it.
Yes.
Distance now.
Okay. 22 - -
Very good.
125 degrees - 125 degrees at 1.2 miles.
Yes, you better not let it go down now. I'll try to get another scale.
Yes.
Roger.
There's the RCS light.
Okay. RCS Heaters - turn them on.
One mile, Wally.
Roger.
1 mile, at 127 degrees.
That's right. Holding steady on the ball.
Looks good.
Yes.
We're getting their light.
Look at that bright light! There he is. Just waiting.
We're coming out in the sun, too, Wally.
Yes.
How about that?
Hope he has some ...
Roger.
74. That's at 30 (minutes).
.74.
Roger.
It's going way down now.
What?
It's going down with respect to the stars.
Okay. I have .57 miles.
... for a while.
...
Fine stars in the back to the north ()
Oh yes. .54.
.51.
...
Stand by to brake.
Ready to brake.
Brake at .48 nautical males.
Point. I'll call that.
.4 nautical miles.
32. .32.
Right.
.30 at ...
Ha, ha.
.32 - .30.
Quarter of a nautical mile.
...
Looks like you've got it slowed down. We're holding 22, 22 - -
Okay ...
1200 feet.
1200 feet at 33.
We're in good shape.
Roger. Dropped a little bit.
.17. Just about 1000 feet, Wally.
1000 feet.
.16 at 33 30.
800 feet.
Roger.
800 feet at 37 (minutes).
Got R-dot at about 6.
Good show.
Want to clear the IVI's?
IVI is clear.
It's numbered.
Group -
...
There's 25.
27.
Okay. 27 ...
They look like they're on fire.
So bright.
There's 27 aft, 14 left.
Keep that range coming.
.11.
660 feet.
540 feet.
Roger.
540 feet at 35 (minutes).
Check.
360 feet.
Roger.
Gosh they're bright!
Yes.
300 feet.
Roger.
We're directly below them.
Roger.
Pitch is 90 degrees.
Roger.
240 feet. MARK.
Roger.
Having fun? (First contact with VII.)
180 feet.
120 feet.
Hello there!
All zips on our radar. Shows 300.
Is that right?
Holding 120, Wally.
Roger.
120 at - 36.
It's still 120 at 36.
You can tell them to turn off the dock light, if they want to save power.
Good. Turn off the dock light, Frank, if you want to save power now.
Yes.
Roger. (Question from VII about antenna sticking out.)
Did I hear something?
Our HF is ...
... We got all surfaces ...
Probably. I'll retrack the HF a little more.
You got a big string hanging on the back of you.
That's the strap we've been talking about.
Yes. It looks like you have a big rope hanging from the back, Frank. It's probably the strap you've been talking about.
Yes, and you have one too. How about coming around and looking me over?
Be very glad to.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Houston CAP COM. Standing by.
Oh, oh! Sunlight!
Houston, this is Gemini VI. Go ahead.
Roger. We're interested in your status.
That sun is blinding.
Hello Houston. Gemini VI.
Holding 120.
Gemini VI. Houston is standing by.
Roger. We're all sitting up here playing bridge together.
Well we have a - what range are we, Tom?
Roger. We have 120 feet steady.
Roger. Understand. Stationkeeping at 120 feet.
I can't see him.
Can you see him?
You got a lot of stuff all around the back end of you. Must be the ... off from the ... test ...
I can't see him. If you can probably keep --
Let me know how close you think we are, Frank. I can't see it at all. The sun's in my eyes.
...
Okay ... Up a little bit, just a little bit. You're right on it in yaw, Wally.
I got the radar needles. That's all I can see. Completely in the sun.
You want me to stay stationary now, Wally? We're almost face up.
This is VII.
Go ahead, Frank.
I'm going to go ahead and put it on Inertial neutral here and stay right on the horizon, if that's what precious wants.
Great ...
Say again.
That will be fine, Frank.
Okay.
Houston, this is Gemini VI. Propellant remaining is approximately 50 percent.
Roger. Copy. The OAMS remaining, 50 percent.
Gemini VI, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go.
Okay. We're showing you GO here on the ground. Can you give me your status?
We're in formation with VII and everything is GO here.
Roger. Congratulations! Excellent!
Thank you. A lot of fun.
You guys really are showing a ... of droop on those wires hanging there.
Stop ... it on me.
Where are they hanging from?
Well, Frank, it looks like it comes out at the separation between - it might be the Fiberglas. It's approximately - oh - 10 to 15 feet long.
The separation plane from the booster, right?
Affirmative.
That's exactly where you have one, too. It really belted around there when you were firing your thrusters.
Looks like about 8 or 9 feet long and double wire.
Right.
We're going to take a picture of it.
Gemini VI, Hawaii.
Go ahead, Hawaii.
I've got an update for you if you're not too busy to copy either - a short one.
I'll let Tom talk to you.
Okay.
Okay. Gemini VI ready to copy.
Okay. D-8 06 35 00; pass at Hawaii; Rev 4. D-8 08:10:00; pass at Hawaii; Rev 5. That's it.
Roger. D-8 at 06 plus 35 plus 00; pass at Hawaii on Rev 4. D-8: 08 plus 10 plus 00; pass at Hawaii on Rev 5.
Okay. Very good. You've got it.
VI and VII, Hawaii. We'll be standing by if you have anything for us.
There just seems to be a little traffic up here, that's all.
Call a policeman.
It was pretty trying during the terminal run. As we looked out, we could see the two Gemini stars casting off to the right of Gemini VI - correction - VII. They were all in a line.
Roger.
We've lost you, VI.
You've lost sight of me, sir?
Roger.
I must affirm a few little things.
Okay.
Keep to your left now.
This is the night light, is it?
Say again.
This doesn't act like a night light, or is that an experiment light?
No. They should both be off.
VI, what's your range?
20 feet.
Roger.
The flag or the letters are ... Looks like they're seared as much at launch as they are when you come back from reentry.
Jim, noticed your blue field is practically burned off.
Right.
Gemini VI, Houston.
Go ahead, Elliot.
Do you have an estimate of your TPI fuel and braking fuel?
Roger. Stand by.
Gemini VI, we're interested in Delta-V's on the terminal phase initiation and the braking, and also several million people are interested in a little more description of the braking and your stationkeeping.
Roger, Elliot. Gemini VI. We've initiated with a Delta-V that was 031 forward. It started initially at 007 up and decreased to 004 up at initiation and right 001. At the completion of TPI we had 62 percent fuel remaining.
Roger.
And now for the big questions.
We have about 49 now, Elliot.
Roger. 49 percent now.
That's affirmative. Our first stick course was 007 forward, 005 left, and 007 up. The final mid-course was 004 forward, 06 right, and 003 up. This pretty much conforms with the plot. We're a little bit below the nominal line there - of the plot at that time. In the braking, we knocked up 27 feet per second Delta-V with our brakings. There's 27 feet per second aft - a total of about 14 left.
Roger. 27 feet per second aft and about 14 left.
Roger. 14 left was the final one.
Roger.
And we will hit position at 120 feet per. We have indicating 50 percent fuel.
Roger. Copy.
R-dots, all the way through, looked fairly nominal and the one backup solution that I did get for the mid-course reads very close with the closed loop.
Roger, Tom.
Right now, we are SEF VII and BEF and we're - oh, I'd say what - 10 feet apart.
Roger. About that.
Yes.
Say again, your range, VI.
About 10 feet.
Roger.
Gemini VII and VI, would you continue with the description of your stationkeeping?
Right now, VI is about 10 feet above and to the left of VII. We're just flying nose to nose, approximately 15 feet apart.
Roger.
We can very clearly see the horizon scanners up ...
Wally, I can see your lateral thrusters are firing out about 40 feet from what we - visual, from what we can see.
How are they doing?
We can't tell now. We're in too close. But when you were doing your Braking Maneuver we could see them ... quite a bit out.
I'll come back in, so we can get nose-to-nose a little bit.
Looks like those wires guillotined off the booster and not at the spacecraft ...
Yes, you have the same thing, only it's in back of yours.
The wire bundles, of course.
Gemini VI, did I understand you to report that thruster plumes were seen 40 feet out?
That was Gemini VII, and I'm sure they saw them that far. We could see them; looks like within a ... down with them.
Houston, on this Braking Maneuver our lateral thrusters fire quite a ways out.
Roger, VII.
Yes. What's confusing?
Gemini VI, would you switch your adapter C-Band to COMMAND?
Gemini VI, adapter to COMMAND.
What did you say, Wally?
You guys sure have big deals.
Ha! ha! ha!
If you're in white, you're in style.
Right.
Gemini VI, Houston.
Go ahead, Elliot.
On that update at Hawaii, those remarks of the pass at Hawaii, Rev 4 and Rev 5, actually do not apply to you. Those were instructions to Hawaii.
12 o'clock tomorrow morning?
How's the food supply holding out?
Oh, it's in good shape.
It's holding out, but it's the same thing day after day.
... point off. Right, yes.
We picked you up, Wally, when the sun reflected off your adapter.
Yes.
Wally, is it good to see the lights on final?
Affirmative. It's good.
Okay.
At what range could they see?
Usually just before transfer, but the ...
This is on the long range ... transfer.
Roger.
Gemini VI, have you been doing any In-Plane Fly-Around?
No, I've been just looking around. We're trying to get ready for a night pass here ...
Roger.
Hey Wally!
Go ahead.
When we get around to the next stateside let us try it for about 5 minutes, will you? I'm after - the fuel is bouncing up a little bit.
Sure.
Okay.
I'm going to platform for the nighttime pass, if you want to back off just a little bit.
When I get in there you're going to leave the platform up?
Yes, we're going to leave it up.
Okay.
That will help you there, Frank, or ... back a little more?
That's okay. I ... in the plat mode now.
Roger.
... on the line right now.
Roger.
This gauge is bouncing right around 15 percent if you look at it right. ... to the left ...
Oh, good. I think we better pitch over.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Houston CAP COM. How do you read?
Loud and clear, Houston. Go ahead.
Could you give us a report on your night stationkeeping?
No trouble at all. We're about 20 feet apart, using the docking lights and the cabin lights of the spacecraft.
Roger. Understand no trouble at all. 20 feet apart. Using the docking lights on VI.
We're using the docking lights from VI to illuminate - -
Roger, understand. Docking lights on VI to illuminate VII.
Spacecraft...
Say again.
... just talking about.
You're not close.
... ring you up.
That's your dump.
Oh, okay.
Can you see Frank's beard, Wally?
Yes, I see yours better, right now.
Did you wipe your mouth, Jim, after you ate?
You must have just wiped your mouth, Jim. Did you?
Yes. Right.
How's the visibility through these windows? They're pretty bad from this side.
Yes. It's pretty bad. We noticed ... that some see through the windows. They are pretty bad on this side.
Through your window, they're right on top of us.
Gemini VI, Houston. We'd like a report on whether you have done a Fly-Around yet on the day side.
Negative. We canceled that to get the ...
Roger, VI.
... we're satisfied to stay here as long as you let us.
We have about 47 percent ... remaining at this time.
Roger. 47 percent remaining.
The forest fires really kick them out, don't they, Jim?
Right. They've been there all the time, Wally.
Yes. That fire down there to your left is an oil fire, I think.
Oh, you see one there from the air?
Right. Maybe that was down to your left. It's ... night.
Okay.
... any way you do it.
Between the black marks.
With your light on, Wally, I can just see the flame of the front of the nozzle.
Roger.
Drinking water, right, Wally?
Roger.
... voltmeter very much to look at.
... rough day.
Ha! ha!
Don't let him kid you. I'm just a ...
Roger. ...
... Merry Christmas and get it over with.
Yes. I still wish we had a pot of fuel here.
You should work up a ...
Right.
...
That's right.
Back up just a little bit.
There doesn't seem to be any shape of a ... just a glob comes out.
... ball of fire attitude ... light out all you can see is the initial flame.
... for awhile.
As you approached us in the rendezvous we could see the fire way out to about 40 feet.
Very good.
Now we didn't even know you were there, Wally.
Right here.
Yes.
Roger. ...
Ha! ha!
Now I can see you a little more ... taking off on the ...
My ... off.
No. I guess it's because I get so many reflections on the window.
Roger. We saw that.
... sunlight.
Roger. I could hit you with it.
... your flight plan, Hawaii.
7 hours 22 minutes ... for a vent.
Check 22.
Roger.
We'll switch to your experiment, then we'll fly around, if that's all right with you.
Let us have about 5 minutes ... trying to move around in this mode.
Oh, fine.
In fact, how about that right now?
Sure, my Maneuver switch has been off for the last 15 minutes.
Okay, we'll just coast around here a little bit and see what it looks like.
Very good.
This experiment will start in about 13 minutes, this morning.
Okay ... Plat mode and Node 2.
I know ... with you.
It's looking pretty good.
Yes, those heaters work fine.
Yes, you're right.
...
That's what I mean - there are times when it looks like there's nothing there.
Yes, a couple of white flakes, and that's about it.
Yes.
We'll be dumping in about 2-1/2 minutes. Radar contact.
Okay, Gemini VI. Will you put your Quantity Read switch to the ECS O<sub>2</sub> position?
You got it.
Okay.
Want to do a - just ... fly around here very shortly.
Roger. Start the tape dump now.
Roger.
We're ready to dump.
Boy, those windows are really bad. I got a good look at your window, Wally. It's really coated.
Yes.
We were lucky.
All right.
... that's a real big problem there.
Wally, can you tell if there's any purge at all?
Say again.
Could you tell if we're purging at all?
I see some white flakes, bubble, white things come off. Not actually bubbles, but ...
Could you move down a little bit so you're more in line with us?
Moving down.
VI, Quantity Read switched to OFF.
Roger. Switch off.
Roger.
VI, we're finished with the experiment.
Roger. ...
VI, Hawaii.
Go ahead, Hawaii.
Okay. We have nothing else for you here. Do you need anything?
If we need anything, we'll disturb you ... flying around right now.
All right. We'll be standing by.
Roger. We have about 46 percent prop quantity.
Say again your prop quantity. 46 percent?
That's correct.
Okay. Thank you.
You going over the top, Wally?
That's right.
Okay.
It's a liquid Freon or Neon or something from the cold IR experiment.
Oh, is that what it is?
Yes.
How does it look from back there?
Looks good.
... load is looking?
We're looking right at your vehicle now.
What's the - how much of a ... have I got?
... Flight.
... just talk out there.
Under the nose here, during the yaw up.
... pretty clean that far out.
Gemini VI, you'll get your block update over CSQ.
The burn was successful.
You will be dumping in approximately 30 minutes, VI.
Could you hold with it for 1 minute?
Sure can.
Gemini VI, this is Houston.
This is VI. Read you loud and clear.
Roger, Gemini VI. You'll get your PLA update over the CSQ on this revolution if you can copy.
Rather wait one more orbit. Over.
I understand you want to wait for one more orbit. Is that correct?
Affirm... wait one more orbit.
Okay. We'll hold it off for another orbit.
Thank you.
...
Gemini VII, this is VI, if you can hold it in yaw for just a little while, we'll try and get in close and get all these close shots of you.
Gemini VI, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead, Hawaii.
How are you doing?
Very good. We're getting a whole bunch of movies this morning.
That's great! I'll be glad to see those. We show you GO here on the ground and I got a Sep Maneuver update when you're ready to copy.
Okay. Stand by.
Ready to copy, there?
VI, Hawaii. Ready to copy?
Stand by.
Okay.
VI is ready to copy.
Okay. GET B 9 44 00; Delta-V, 9 feet per second; your burn time 0 plus 15; yaw and pitch are zero; Core 25, 90090; Cores 26 and 27 are all zeros; forward-firing thrusters, a Retrograde Maneuver, this is your Sep Maneuver.
Roger. For separation burn GET, 09 plus 44 plus 00; Delta-VT of 9.0; duration, 0 plus 15; yaw 0, pitch 0. ... Core 25, 90090; 26, 27, all zeros; thruster forward-firing with the Retrograde Maneuver.
Okay, Tom, very good. You got it all.
And Stand by. I want to get one up to VII.
Okay, VII and VI. Hawaii will be standing by. We have about another 4 or 5 minutes here.
Hawaii. Gemini VI.
Hawaii CAP COM, Gemini VI.
Gemini VI, Hawaii CAP COM. GO.
Roger. We asked for another orbit for photography. There seems to be no reason to raise ...
Okay, Wally. Stand by one.
Okay.
Gemini VI, Hawaii.
Go ahead.
All that I just gave you, you can scrub it out. They're giving you GO for another revolution.
Very good. We have about 41 percent fuel, ... over.
Roger, I copy that.
Gemini VI, CSQ CAP COM.
CSQ. Gemini VI. Go.
Roger. We'd like for you to observe VII on this roll procedure  and let us know if you see any water coming out of VII.
Roger. I will be observing and moving and taking pictures.
Roger.
At this point, no observation.
Roger.
Also, VI, you'll get a maneuver update through - Sep Maneuver update over Hawaii this revolution.
Roger.
You might inform Colonel Cooper that we just ... still-photographed and movies of Gemini VII going over the Himalayas at sunrise.
Roger.
We're planning now. I can see if there are any substances.
Only saw one flake that time, Frank.
There's a whole lot coming by, right by my side.
... for you, Wally.
I see some now. Yes. Is that your water boil?
I guess so.
Yes. I see it now.
...
Right.
Just aft of you, that's the water boil.
The wiring cable, Frank, is hanging on. By your centrifugal force it's just about straight out now. Looks like it's about 10 feet long. ... to the adapter.
Can you affirm ... whips all around right there.
It's right at the separation plane.
That's right.
... come and look for us so ...
All right.
VII, this is VI. Apparently we can see lots and lots of water coming out all over the back of ...
Thank you.
VI, this is VII. I think it helped out our fuel cells a little, too.
Affirmative.
Good show. I hope it stays up ...
... better start the ..., Wally.
Okay. Will go.
... cable wind up behind you.
I got a real ball of ice back there ... water ...
Yes. You sure do! It's a big ball!
Is it the water boiler?
It certainly looks ...
Was it there before, VI?
Negative.
I suggest you roll starboard about 30 degrees and you'll put it right in the sun.
Gemini VI, CSQ. You say the water - the frozen water appears beyond the water boiler?
Yes, that's obvious to us, yes.
We wanted to roll about 180 degrees to the right or left and to get that blob of ice in the sun.
Okay.
Try out the water boiler outlet.
180 degrees to the right. How's that?
Fine.
Gemini VI, Hawaii CAP COM.
Gemini VI.
Okay. I've got your Sep Maneuver update if you're ready to copy.
Stand by.
VI is ready.
Okay. Radar and track and solid telemetry on both vehicles. Okay. We're showing you GO here on the ground. And here we go: GET B; 11 plus 14 plus 29; Delta-V, 9 feet per second; burn time, 0 plus 15; yaw 00, pitch 00; Core 25, 90090; Cores 26 and 27 are all zeros; and it will be a forward firing thruster burn; Retrograde Maneuver.
Roger. The separation is 11 plus 14 plus 29; Delta-V, 9.0 feet per second; duration, 0 plus 15; yaw 0, pitch 0; Core 25, 90090; 26 and 27, all zeros; thruster is forward-firing; retrograde burn.
Okay, Tom. You got it all and here's what we'd like you to do prior to making the burn. We'd like you to move 5 to 10 feet north of Spacecraft VII and about 50 feet behind. This is prior to making the burn. Now the reason for this is to keep the Spacecraft VII D-4/D-7 instrument away from the sun.
Affirmative.
Are you worried about us getting between the sun and him?
That's what it looks like.
We've never been there, we watched out for that.
Okay, Wally, that's where they'd like you to go just prior to making the burn. Okay?
Okay. I'll just try to keep our shadow off of him all this time.
Roger. Very good. You will be having the UHF 6 over the RKV.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Hawaii.
... that's a fine place to start to burn some, Wally. I think they just did not want the IR sensor pointing into the sun.
Got you, Frank.
I have both eyes on your water boiler outlet ... looks like a small ... about the size of a tube.
Okay, VI and VII. We'll see you tomorrow.
Thank you.
Roger. Good show here.
Hawaii. VI. We have 36 percent of our propellant remaining.
Okay, VII. 36 percent - correction, VI, - 36 percent propellant remaining.
One of those four numbers will work.
Does that thing handle like a Maserati?
...
Okay. Roger.
It handles very nicely ...
Gemini VI, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead ...
How'd your separation burn go?
...
Roger.
...
Roger.
Gemini VI ... overnight, RKV.
That's affirm.
...
... come on, you want the back light off?
...
Okay, Frank ... degrees.
Do you want us to follow you?
Gemini VI, CSQ. Do you copy?
I'd like to have that ... GET.
Say again.
... copy ... GET ... Can we - -
Roger.
... copy now. You ready?
Go ahead.

Roger, and VI on your OAMS status, your fuel remaining is 148 pounds; oxidizer remaining, 193 pounds. Our calculations show that to be an actual 43 percent remaining on propellant, and that was calculated prior to your last sep burn.
... I cut you out. Would you say again after quantity?
Roger. Did you copy the fuel and oxidizer remaining?
No.
Okay. Propellant quantity remaining actual, 43 percent.
Roger. Understand 43 percent. We're reading about 32.
Roger. Well, this calculation is made before your last sep burn.
Understand.

Roger.
Pressure's now pulse mode and platform on.
Roger.
We didn't have any trouble. We were pulsing all around looking at ...
Sounds like fun.
Sure is.
Got a bunch of pretties running around the back of that thing.
Did you get some good pictures?
Oh, we sure hope so. We snapped about ... four rolls of color about 50 ... Hasselblad.
Roger. Have a good night's sleep. I feel like a baby sitter. I tuck you in every night, and now I'm baby sitting for four of you.

Gemini VI, standing by for your food and water report.
Also like to get a cabin temp reading and your suit inlet temp reading.
Roger. On the food and water report, both Pilots have consumed two meals. We'll add up the water for you in a minute. Cabin temperature, 84. The suit temperature was 58.
Roger. I'd like to get a propellant quantity remaining and an OAMS source pressure.
32 percent indicated propellant quantity. OAMS source temperature is 70 degrees; psi is 1650.
Copy. 1650.
We have a valid oral temp on Command Pilot.
Okay, at your convenience we'd like you to run a cabin temp survey and just record it in your log book for post-flight. We'd like the cabin's ambient dry and wet bulb, suit inlet dry and wet bulb. Remove the blue nozzle and check directly in the O<sub>2</sub> flow. If possible, we'd like a hatch surface temperature and side wall surface temperature.
Okay. We're going to relax after a hard day's work. You'll get that jazz sometime tomorrow.
That's affirmative. At your convenience.
Okay.
I'd like your evaluation of your posigrade burn.
No residual.
Roger.

I thought I had this trouble with ... Station before.
Copy.
Right. Okay, stand by VI. I'm going to VII now and get a purge.
Roger.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon.
Gemini VI. Go.
Okay, I have some instructions for you. Okay, you can power up. I would like to bring your computer up, and bring you up to power, and bring your radar up to standby; after 5 minutes turn radar on and copy radar readings every 10 minutes, between Carnarvon and US.
What we want there is range, pitch and time.
Okay. We've got our computer on, it's in PRELAUNCH. Turned radar on at 42 minutes elapsed time.
Roger. What we want off your radar is your time, range and pitch.
On Spacecraft VII?
That's affirm. We already turned the transponder on.
Okay, he'll be aft of me. That's correct, right?
That is affirm.
Okay, we'll get to look at you all now; we're purging.
Also I have a flight plan update for you, whenever you're ready to copy.
Are you ready to copy, VI?
That's affirmative. Go ahead.
Okay. Time 22 25 06; crew status report at Carnarvon. That completes the update; it was just a short item.  Can you position your Cryo Gaging switch to ECS O<sub>2</sub>, please?
Roger. ECS O<sub>2</sub>. At 22 25 06 crew status at Carnarvon.
At Carnarvon ... two.
Carnarvon, Gemini VI.

Can you repeat, please?
Roger. I took one Actyfed (Spell Actyfed) pill at 21 hours 35 minutes.
Roger. We copy. Okay, you can turn your Cryo Gaging switch back to OFF, VI.
Roger. We're going around to pick up VII.
Gemini VI, Houston.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Houston.
This is Gemini VI. Go.
Roger, Gemini VI. Request that you kick the tape recorder. We feel that the tape might be out of the limits which, by kicking it, we might get good tape operation.
Roger. I'll kick my foot.
Also, we'd request any range, elevation, and time that you may have gotten by now from the line of sight to Gemini VII.
Roger. We have a lock-on now, ... at 21 50 we had a range of 22.24 nautical miles ... at 22 plus 00 we had a range of 17.63 nautical miles and we still have a positive lock-on. At 51 we have a range of 16.0 nautical miles.
Roger. Read back, Gemini VI.
Roger. 21 50, we have a range of 22.24 nautical miles; at 22:00, we have a range of 17.63 nautical miles.
Roger, Gemini VI.

Gemini VI, Texas CAP COM. We'd like to remind the Command Pilot to put the oral temp probe in his mouth at this time.
You just ruined a good breakfast.
Sorry.
Go ahead.
Hello, Houston, this is Gemini VI with the water, food and sleep reports.
Roger. Gemini VI, Houston Surgeon. Go ahead.
Roger. Command Pilot has a total of 129 half-ounce drinks and three meals, Pilot has 113 half-ounce drinks and three meals.
Roger. Copy three meals apiece, one with 129 half-ounce drinks and one with 113 half-ounce drinks for the Command Pilot and Pilot, respectively. Can you give us a report on your sleep?
We slept approximately 5 hours apiece.
How good?
Gemini VI, Houston Surgeon. Would the Pilot send us a blood pressure while we're waiting for the Command Pilot's oral temp?
Roger. Houston, double purge complete on Section 2.
Roger on double purge complete on Section 2.
Place your Fuel Cell Control 2 circuit breaker off.
Roger. Completed.
Repeat Step 5. Open -
Cuff is full-scale, VI.

Roger, Houston. ... get the word on the Theta, - we have the range.
Roger. We request to have that information, please.
Roger. The range at 20 - at our GET of 21 50 00 plus 22.24. The range 22 plus 00 plus 00 was 17.63. The range at 22 plus 12 plus 00 was 18.33. The range at 22 plus 20 plus 00 was 19.55. The range at 22 plus 30, range was 26.31.
Roger, Gemini VI. Can you tell me if the Spacecraft VII is above your altitude or below your altitude?
He is above our altitude.
He was above you when you got those readings?
That is affirmative, and I have him in sight with reflected lights here.
You have him in sight with reflected light?
That's affirmative.
We have both high ACQ lamps of reflected light.
Can you give me an estimation of the elevation angle - -?
... got for you but we want to get cleaned up in here; to track him only proves that we're able to rendezvous and we've done that. We'd like to get the cockpit stowed fairly soon here.
Roger.
So we know what radar range and Theta is already. You want to give us an update on what the real retro time is?
Gemini VI, Houston. Understand. Will you have any non-nominal stowage?
We're considering leaving the water bags in the right aft box and not changing them to the left-hand box; otherwise, they will be identical.
Roger. Water bags in the right aft as opposed to the left aft box.
That is correct. They will be where they were for launch.
Roger. Same place that they were in launch. And I'd like to reverify that, at the time these readings were taken, Gemini VII was above you.
That's affirmative.
Thank you very much, Gemini VI.
Roger. 4 or 5 degrees above. We can see them now.
4 or 5 degrees above; thank you very much.
We're trying - would you give us an update on our 17-1 retrofire time, just so we can prep up to it?
Roger.
14 53 21 GMT. GET is 25 15 55. Gemini VI, Houston. Did you copy?
Roger. We have a GMT of 14 plus 53 plus 51. GET RC at 25 plus 15 plus 55.
Roger. That GMT is 14 53 21. Your GET is correct.
Roger. Gemini out.
Gemini VI, Houston. Please verify Tape Recorder Power circuit breaker on. Tape Recorder Control circuit breaker off.
That is affirmative. Our Tape Recorder Power is on, Control is off.
Thank you very much, Tom.
Gemini VI, Houston Surgeon. You noticing some effect from the Actyfed yet?
I'm using less Kleenex. I miss also not being able to ... during the early morning reveille.
Roger, Gemini VI.
We should ..., but we're doing okay.
Roger. Copy, VI.
Good morning, Captain Schirra.
Good morning, Chris. That was a ball!
You're doing great. Let's put it down on the elevator.
Number 3 or Number 2?
Your choice.
Roger. We'll try them both.
Stand by. We'll have to change the targeting.
... getting set up for that rendezvous.
... or we'll be on the boat.
Roger.
VI, VII.
Go ahead, Jim.
Want to wager who gets closest?
...
I need some payola there.
We're going to make the bet out of contact with ground stations.

Okay.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI. Place your ... on, please.
Roger. They're on.
Roger.
Roger, Houston.
Gemini VII, this is Gemini VI. We have an object, looks like a satellite going from north to south, probably in a polar orbit. He's in a very low trajectory traveling from north to south and has a very high climbing ratio. It looks like it might even be a ... Very low. Looks like he might be going to reenter soon. Stand by one ... You might just let me try to pick up that thing.
We got them too, VI.
That was live, VII, not tape.
You're too much, VI!
...
Gemini VI. Stand by for an update on your computer for a retro. Are you ready to accept it?
Gemini VI. Affirmative. We are in PRELAUNCH.

Roger. 03 is 38549; 04 is 61388; 05 is 07513; Core 66, 65384; 07, 35999; 08, 40014; 09, 12421; Core 10, 02346; Core 11, 29217.
Roger, Tom. For your information, our T/M verifies this, and we have run out a solution and it looks good. Would you read 03 back? I was interrupted. I did not get your read-back. I think it was correct.
Roger. 03 is 38549.
Roger. They all check, Tom.
We'll give her a go.
I've got an Area 17-1 update for you also.
When you're ready to copy.
Go.

Gemini VI, we want to try another tape dump here, just one more try. Would you place your Tape Recorder Control circuit breaker on, and verify the Tape Recorder Power circuit on?
Roger. Tape Recorder on, Control circuit breakers are on.
Roger.
Houston, Gemini VI. All cores check satisfactorily.
Very good, VI.
Gemini VI, Houston. How are you coming on the retro preparations? Getting everything stowed away?
Roger. We have one camera out and we'll throw it down in the box when we're all finished up.
Very good. Don't let that satellite get away from you.
You sure did let it get away from him.
Gemini VI. We have no joy on your tape dump. We'd like you to place the Tape Recorder Power circuit breaker off and leave the Control circuit breaker on.
Roger. Power off, Control on.
Roger, Tom.
Houston, Gemini VI. Do you have the latest ... readouts for the nominal?
You're very weak, VI. Say again.
Roger. Do you have the latest nominal IVI rate with the readouts?
They're the same as we gave you on preflight. The 308 number.
Houston, this is Gemini VI. I'm going to suggest ... stowed.
Say again, Tom. You were just a little fast there. Something about stowage.
Roger. Give us the IVI coverage again. It still doesn't look right.
Roger. It's 308 amps - - stand by.
And 117 down.
Roger. Copy 308 amps and 117 down.

Can you give us the Mark at 53 45?
MARK. 53 45.
Roger. We're right on it.
Roger. We've got about 2 minutes to your 20-minute mark on your event timer.
Check.
Gemini VI, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Go ahead.
During retrofire go ahead and use both rings. After retrofire turn Ring B off and do not use it, only Ring A, unless both rings are required for attitude control.
Roger. That's what I wanted to do.
Roger. They do not want you to dump it after drogue deploy.
You mean leave the fuel in the lines?
That's affirmative.
Ten seconds. 3, 2, 1.
MARK.
I'm with you.
Roger. Your T<sub>R</sub> is right in sync with the ground.

Ha, Ha, Ha!
Sorry I can't join the Pacific Fleet ... landing.
Roger.
Really a good job Frank and Jim; we'll see you on the beach.
Okay, Wally.
Did you have a chance to see us during that ...
We couldn't get a picture of you because we don't have any thrusters now.
Roger. Did you have a chance to see though?
No.
Okay.
VI, Hawaii.
Go, Hawaii.
Okay. Your horizon will be lit at 400K.

This is Houston. Go ahead, VI.
... this is Gemini VI transmitting in the blind. How do you read?
Houston reads you, Gemini VI. Can you confirm main?
Gemini VI, this is Russ Land Leader. Roger, we are reading you. We believe we are 30 miles away, on the way. Over.
Gemini VI, Roger.
Gemini VI, this is Russ Land Leader. Can you give us your altitude?
It's 2,000 feet, descending about 35 feet per second.
... 2,000 feet.
That's affirmative. 30 feet per second.
Gemini VI, 1,000 feet, 30 feet per second.
Roger, Leader. Roger, out.
Gemini VI, Russ Land Leader. How do you read? Over.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI, Airborne. Over.
Gemini VI, Gemini VI. This is ... Over.

Roger. Staging.
We have Staging.
Staging looks good.
We're having Wally's fireball here.
Yes.
Did you see it?
Yes, I did.
Understand you have Guidance Initiate.
Roger. We have Guidance Initiate.
Zero pitch and 1 degree yaw right coming up.
Roger. Guidance looks good on the ground.
Roger.
Coming right up.
All systems looking good.
Oh, there's the horizon!
We finally get to see it.
Okay. You're looking good, Coach.
Okay. The fuel cells are all solid as a rock.
Okay. Everything looks good on the right.
Fine. And needles are ... pitch is zero, yaw is about a quarter of a degree and steady.
Roger. Your plots are looking very nominal here on the ground, VIII.
Roger. The second stage is a real good machine.
I was going to say a Cadillac, but I guess I better not say that.
Coming up on 4 minutes.
Cabin pressure is 5.5 psid and holding.
Roger. Accelerometers at 4 minutes.
Hey, how about that view!
That's fantastic!
They were right, weren't they?
Boy! Here we go!
Gemini VIII, you're GO from the ground.
Roger. Looks good up here.
There we are. Right on the money.
Rates are very stable.
Little bit of yaw oscillation.
Coming up on 5 minutes.
Yes. Coming up on 5 minutes right now.
MARK. V/VR = .08, Gemini VIII.
Okay. Mode 3.
Zero pitch and yaw a quarter of a degree and steady.

We've had SECO.
Roger. SECO.
Okay.
Take your time, Buddy.
Okay.
Gemini VIII, you're GO, and give me IVI's when you have time.
Thank you. We're thrusting forward.
Look at the stuff out front.
Burn stop.
Roger. Stop burn.
Oops!
Gemini VIII, your 1-Alpha time is 15 06.
Okay. We got that.
Look at that stuff floating out there.
Yes. Some pressure.
Okay, Dave.
Okay, Neil. Check bearings.
Okay. Looks good.
Rates look good.
Yes.
All the way.
Fairings are jettisoned.
We had a pitch-up at fairing jettison.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. We understand fairings have been jettisoned.
That's affirm.
Okay. Ready for the first Check List.
Stand by one.
Okay.
Okay. I'm ready to read.
Okay.
Gemini VIII's Aline of the Platform. We apparently have a good Primary Scanner.
Okay. ... status.
Say again.
Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead, Houston. This is VIII.
Your orbit is 85 by 155. Your GMT lift-off was 16 41 02.
16 41 02.
Roger.
Okay. Retro squibs (4), SAFE.
Okay. Maneuver controller, off and stowed.
Off and stowed.
D-Ring safety pin, install.
Sequence Light Test.
Okay. Here we go!
AMBER.
Okay.
Roger.
And RED and GREEN.
Good. Darn good.
Computer PRELAUNCH.
... just from the IVI's ... after the burn at 18 with a plane indicating right. Now, heads up.
Okay. Retro ... squibs to CLOSE.
Secondary O<sub>2</sub> to CLOSE.
OAMS Heaters's circuit breaker coming closed.
And it stays closed.
Roger.
OAMS Heaters's circuit breaker closed.
Cryo Quantity to OFF.
Check.
We look good all the way.
Recorder is coming off.
Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM. I have your 1-4 time, if you're ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Roger. GET RC 01 00 16; RET 400K, 15 plus 21; RET RB, 20 plus 08; roll left 85.
Roger. 1-4 01 00 16; RET RB, 20 plus 08; roll left 85. And Insertion Check List is complete.
You were cut off there at the end, VIII.
Right. I've got the Insertion Check List complete.
Roger. Insertion Check List complete. Thank you.
Still look good.
If you did not copy, the RET of 400K was 15 plus 21.
Good old Jim! Thank you.
Gemini VIII, Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. Your orbit is changed to 87, 147. You're GO for a nominal M equals 4. There will be a slight Plane Change. We'll give you that information later and we understand that the ... temperatures were hotter than normal and we're reminding you to activate the right unit Number 1 handle at Time 40.
... 40.
Also all systems look okay...
Roger. All systems are okay and standing by for a UHF Number 2 check.
Okay.
Houston, this is Gemini VIII on your UHF Number 2. How do you read?
Roger. Gemini VIII, this is Houston. Reading you slightly garbled but loud. How me?
...
This is Houston. Roger.
Going back to Number 1.
You're going to Number 1.
Dave advises that Nuclear Emulsion came on at 23 minutes.
Roger. Gemini VIII. Nuclear Emulsion on at 23 minutes.
... we are seeing stars at 30 minutes elapsed time, and the Spacecraft is ... sunlight.
31 minutes. Now we are seeing a lot of stars.
That could be a light.
... I see a light on the ground.
... on the horizon. That's where the light would be, I think.
You do?
I do see thruster flashings now. Platform Alining on the Secondary Scanner.
Tananarive, you're unreadable. We ...
Gemini VIII, Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM.
Hello, Houston CAP COM. Now we're reading you all okay. Gemini VIII.
Roger. This is my first call. Don't forget your Radiator to FLOW at 035.
Okay. Radiator going to FLOW.
Roger. And around 00 40, the C-Reentry to COMMAND, the C-Adapter to CONTINUOUS and the S-3 Experiment.
I didn't quite get that. Would you say again, please?
Roger. At 40, the C-Reentry to COMMAND, the C-Adapter to CONTINUOUS and the Frog Egg Experiment.
Roger. We have that.
Roger. We're just standing by.
It reminds me of an oil flame that you see over Texas.
... here ... We're at 38 minutes and I noticed the thrusters are firing out the right side only. Now this may be a Platform Mode, or it could be due to the fact that it's taking care of the water boiler exhaust.
38 minutes elapsed time. The night side - we have a well-definable horizon, but we have stars visible below the horizon, and that one property in comparing the horizon is probably the best one to make a mark on.
Okay. At 40 minutes and about 10 seconds, the S-3 Unit Number 1 is activated.
Okay.
41 minutes. We're going to Primary Scanner on the Horizon Scan and no appreciable difference in Primary or Secondary Scanner operation; going to Primary CATCH-UP in 50 minutes and --
IVI's are zero.
Well, that's about it.
1A, 9.5; 1B, 10.0; 1-Main, 14.5; 2-Main, 8.0; 2A, 4.8; 2B, 5.2; Main bus is 24.5.
Gemini VIII, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Hi there, Carnarvon! Go ahead.
How you all doing?
Just fine!
Okay. We're showing you real good here on the ground. We're giving you a GO on your radiator. Put your Evaporator to NORMAL.
Evaporator is NORMAL.
Okay.
How about your Quantity Read switch to ECS O<sub>2</sub> position and leave it there until I tell you to move it.
Roger. ECS O<sub>2</sub>.
Okay. I'm showing you in PRELAUNCH. Are you doing some computations or can you go into CATCH-UP?
Ready for Accelerometer Bias Check any time you are.
Okay. Let's go to CATCH-UP.
Okay. Got you in CATCH-UP.
We need a battery in your fuel cell.
Roger. The batteries are GO, and - ready to copy the fuel cell?
Went to CATCH-UP at 50 minutes. IVI's are zero.
Go ahead.
1A, 9.5; 1B, 10.0; 1-Main, 14.5; 2-Main, 8.0; 2A, 4.8, 2B, 5.2. Main bus is 24.5.
Okay. I copy that.
Okay. I'll copy that.
... get the sheet.
Get a light in here.
Okay. You're GO for 16-1.
Go ahead. All yours.
Thank you very much.
How about that?
You can leave your computer running, you know.
Stand by.
How about setting up 52 minutes and counting up? I'll give you a time hack at that point.
Okay.
You like it up there, right?
You bet!
It's all right!
Very nice!
Okay. The computers are running pretty good. Hope they keep up like they should.
I'm up to GET Clock Check.
On your Mark. Stand by.
3, 2, 1,
MARK. 52.
Right on it.
Okay. We're right with you.
And we're ready for the START COMP any time you are.
Okay. Quantity Read to OFF.
Coming OFF.
Carnarvon. Gemini VIII, if you're ready for the Accelerometer Bias Check, we'll start counting.
We're ready for your check, sir.
Okay. On my Mark, ...
Do you want to give the start count so I can start my watch?
3, 2, 1,
MARK.
Got it.
Roger.
Here. You got the time?
Vibrator is normal and we went to START COMP at 53 minutes.
Did you start S-3 at 40 minutes?
That's affirm.
Okay.
That was 40 minutes, 10 seconds.
40 what?
40 minutes, 10 seconds.
Okay.
Okay. We've cut our computer summaries. You can go on to PRELAUNCH any time you want.
We did put in a couple of pulses in yaw.
Oh, okay.
Any more for us?
Say again.
Couldn't do any more for us than you have. We've got everything going for us now.
That's what we're here for, isn't it?
Now what did you say about the storms?
I say, we have quite a bit of storms just ahead of us here. We can see the lightning.
Yes, we could use some rain.
Not like the last time you were here.
Let me know when you're going over to PRELAUNCH.
Roger. Accelerometer bias count.
Okay. We have the addresses if you're ready to copy, Carnarvon.
Go ahead.
80, minus 0004; 81 was 00001; 82 was minus 0004.
Okay. I copied all that. Have you in PRELAUNCH now.
Okay. I have a little over a minute to LOS. I don't have anything for you. We'll stand by and let you count.
Let me have your Core 81 again.
Roger. Core 81 was 00001.
Okay. I was right. Thank you.
Ejection seat safety to ... - Carnarvon GO - and shoulder harness was released.
Hello, Gemini VIII, Gemini 7/6. Over.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii CAP COM.
This is Gemini 7/6 enroute Honolulu. Do you read?
Gemini, this is Hawaii. We have a computer load for you. Are you ready? Over.
We're all set.
Roger. Transmitting computer load.
Roger. Got DCS, Height-Adjust.
Roger. And are you ready to copy the update? Over.
Stand by, Hawaii.
Roger.
Go.
We have you down there. Looks like a nice day.
Beautiful weather here.
Okay. Go with the update, Hawaii.
Roger. GET B 1 34 37; Delta-V, 2.9; burn time, 0 plus 05; yaw 0, pitch 0; Address 25, 90029; Address 26, all zeros; Address 27, all zeros; thrusters forward; Maneuver Retrograde. Did you copy?
That is 26, all zeros. Roger. 27, all zeros. Thrusters forward and Maneuver's Retrograde. Did you copy?
Roger, Hawaii. Got it. GET B burn, 01 34 37; Delta-V, 2.9; duration, 0 plus 05; yaw 0, pitch 0; Address 25, 90029; 26 all zeros; 27 all zeros; both confirmed; thrusters forward; Maneuver's Retro.
That's correct. Also be advised that Wally Schirra has been trying to contact you. His call sign is Gemini 7/6. He's inbound to Honolulu.
Oh, very well. We're standing by.
Has he got HF?
Is he trying to contact us by UHF or HF?
He was on UHF. We haven't heard him for a couple of minutes.
Okay.
Okay. Let's see how we get the IVI's. What do you say?
Okay. Catch-up and we'll see what happens.
You will?
... PRELAUNCH ...
... this ... Forward firing thrusters, Retrograde burn at 1 34 37.
... that's 14 minutes from now.
Okay. Now we want to do a Platform Aline before that.
It's really not required - for 3 feet per second, I don't think.
Does that concur with ...?
What does it say in the Flight Manual?
...
Gemini, this is Hawaii. We have nothing further for you. Standing by.
Okay. All good and well up here.
Yes. You want to aline it as good as you can. It says 15 minutes prior ... allow Platform Mode to aline platform.
1 34 37 is start time. ...
You understand ... Platform. You can see out the window that it's - no, that it's 90 degrees, anyway.
...
If you aline it, it takes the ...
I agree.
If you aline it in a 3-feet-per-second burn, if you are 10 degrees off on the Platform, it'd be hard for us to see it, as far as the Delta-V operation is. So why don't we - as we come upon the stage we'll put it in SEF for a little while. Well, 5 minutes before you're supposed to go to ORBIT RATE. Okay. I'll just put it in SEF COMP right now. Kind of fun.
It really kicks it around there, doesn't it?
Yes. It's winding right up.
Wonder where we'll be at 1 34. Oh, I know! It's on the - on the - we'll be right over Houston on this pass.
... Try and get that camera.
Okay.
1 34 ...
... Hang on.
1 34?
No, I'm sorry - Yes. 1 34.
Okay. All right. All right. Just a minute.
...
Okay.
We'll have to ask Houston, won't we?
Think we're going to have to.
Think we ought to.
Think we ought to ...
Oh. Look at that one!
What was that time? 1 34 what?
1 34 37.
You got your - -
What's the matter?
The thermometer is ...
Yes. The thermometer's always a nuisance.
I'm not sick. Tell them I'm not sick!
1 27 33. Right?
Well, I would say maybe we'd better do ...
Gemini VIII, Guaymas CAP COM.
Roger.
Station calling Gemini VIII, say again.
Station calling Gemini VIII, say again.
Gemini VIII, this is Guaymas. I have a load update - -
Stand by. He has an update. What kind of update do you have, Guaymas?
It's a MAP update.
Okay. Stand by.
Roger.
Okay?
Okay. Go ahead.
Time on load - -
Beautiful!
Time 01 07 13; Rev 1, 159.1 degrees east; 16 plus 00, right ascension.
Right. Got you. Node 01 07 13; Rev 1, 159.1; 16 plus 00, right ascension.
That's affirmative. We have you GO on the ground.
We're going over Baja California now. Can you see it?
Oh! Look at all those ships!
...
Good.
Okay. I've got to go into a - ORB RATE here.
Also Attitude Control, RATE COMMAND.
Platform, ORB RATE.
Okay.
Computer, CATCH-UP.
Computer looks good.
Okay.
FDR, COMP.
FDR, COMP.
Maneuver Controller, unstow.
That's good.
Maneuver Controller, ON.
Okay. ON.
Okay.
1 34 37. How's that?
Right.
1 34 37. We want to have a 5-second burn and forward firing thrusters will give us a Retrograde Maneuver.
Okay. I think I'll burn it back.
Okay.
All right.
Sort of like to know how it works.
Yes, I think we ought to take a picture.
Yes.
Would be nice, but I - nice ...
Nice cloud formations!
Beautiful! Just spectacular!
Hope you remember to look up when we start going after the Agena.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston CAP COM. We're standing by for your burn.
Roger. Got 3 minutes to go.
Pressure coming up ... approach.
We cross Houston at the burn; it's between Houston and - the Cape.
Okay. 0°, 0°, 0°, Platform.
Okay. ORB RATE and we're CATCH-UP.
Standing by to hear ...
... the Controller is off and on. START COMP ...
I have a shoreline in sight here. I really don't have Houston picked out though.
...
We are coming up on 32.42 ... Houston ...
I've got it.
I'm going to push your START COMP 1 33. Right?
1 33 START COMP.
Now you're going to go back. Right?
Aft. I'm going to pull aft.
Save that gas.
Coming up on 1 33 37.
Okay. We're 1 minute to burn, going right over the coastline now...
Roger, VIII. Stand by for a 30-second Mark to your burn.
Okay.
MARK. 30 seconds to burn.
Okay.
Keep an eye out the window and see what it looks like with this forward firing.
MARK.
Burn.
Roger.
Purging.
MARK.
2, 1, burn.
Roger.
Fine. Burn end.
MARK.
What number?
Minus 0001.
I got that.
2. Okay. 82. That's - -
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. We're placing your T/M switch to REAL TIME/DELAY TIME.
Okay.
Yes. A real good idea.
Okay. Let's try it.
Wrong way.
Address 82 is not the ...
Address 82 is minus, so we want to go - -
Let's try it again.
Okay.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston requesting your Tape Playback switch to CONTINUOUS.
Oh, shoot! Stand by.
Stand by, Houston.
Roger. Will do.
Let's try Address 81 again and see what it is.
See it?
It's building up now.
Fine. Okay. Now to put - now you're 82 ... 80, 81, 82 is down. You should go. Yes. I guess you're right. It should go.
I think I was.
Okay. I understand.
Gemini VIII. This is Houston. You don't have to answer. We'd like to have your computer in PRELAUNCH when you can.
...
Okay.
That's almost a foot per second.
Computer's in PRELAUNCH. We're putting Tape Playback to CONTINUOUS.
Roger. Thank you. Understand you were to take out residuals. How did it go?
Yes, we took out the residuals, but they seem to be building up on us with time.
Roger. That is part of your accelerometer bias.
Yes, I think that's right. Are you going to update that bias?
Whenever you're ready, we're going to send you an accelerometer update.
Okay. I think we're probably - stand by a minute.
Roger. We're standing by.
What was the last number?
81 was a 3.
80 was a zero.
Okay. Tell them to go ahead.
Okay. Go ahead and send the new bias for us.
Roger. Coming up.
We have not gotten a light yet.
Stand by. It's coming, VIII.
Now my impression, Partner, is that 82 hit the button.
So you're right.
Roger.
Got a light. Reset.
Roger. Understand you have the light.
Okay. You have the Tape Playback in CONTINUOUS.
Hey, we still - they got the Tape Playback in CONTINUOUS now. You know that?
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. The accelerometer bias update was good.
Roger. Thank you.
Say again, Dave.
They have the Tape Playback in CONTINUOUS. We're not going to ...
We're really ... update ...
Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM here.
Go ahead.
Roger. Would you please verify that your Antenna Select switch is in ADAPTER? Over.
Roger.
Thank you.
Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM. I have your Phase Adjustment Maneuver update if you're ready to copy.
Roger. Go ahead.
Roger. GET B 2 18 26; Delta-V, 49.3; Delta-T, 1 plus 07; yaw 0, pitch 0; Core 25, 00493; Cores 26 and 27, all zeros; thrusters aft; Maneuver Posigrade. Did you copy?
Roger. Understand. Phase-Adjust at 02 18 26 49.3; 1 plus 07; yaw 0, pitch 0; 25, 00493; 26 and 27, all zeros; aft thrusters; Posigrade.
Roger, Dave. Okay.
Roger.
What was that time, Dave?
The time? 02 18 26.
And Gemini VIII, would you put your Tape Playback switch to COMMAND?
Tape Playback in COMMAND.
Roger. And T/M switch to REAL-TIME and ACQ.
REAL-TIME and ACQ.
Say, you sort of lose a little bit of voice up here, you know.
I noticed it on everybody that has flown.
Let's see now. Is this - this is just a one-man package?
We have some food in here, if you want some food.
Well, this is Day 1 Meal B for me, and I think yours is in there. I think we ought to go ahead and have one because - -
Yes. You're right.
- - because we're not going to get much of a chance after - we've got the best part of an hour here.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. You'll probably expect an update on that Phase-Adjust Maneuver over Ascension. Over.
Okay. Understand.
Let's see. Have we got everything stowed that we want to stow?
No, not really. I've got to work on the TV monitor a little bit. My helmet - it's really not - doesn't really have a place to rest on that.
There isn't any. I thought there was supposed to be - -
Yes, I did too.
We'll write it up.
Stow in here someday.
Day 2, Meal A.
See it?
There.
That doesn't sound right, does it?
That's for tomorrow morning, I guess. There must be another package over there someplace. Let me look in the Flight Plan to make sure.
Okay, it's in your right-hand food box.
I sort of wanted to get this darn thing cleaned out.
Yes.
Day 1, Meal B. I'll buy that.
Man, that's peculiar!
What did you say?
The water is kind of peculiar.
Oh, great!
I think there's some air bubbles in it (water).
Is that right?
Yes.
They got some LOX in the water again.
Have they had the problem before?
Yes, they sure have.
Ready.
LOX.
What?
Do you want it?
Okay.
Sure does.
I find that there is a lot less room in this cockpit than I thought there was.
You hoped there was. Right?
There's a heck of a lot less room!
Gemini VIII, Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead, Houston.
Roger. I have an update to your Phase-Adjust Maneuver if you're ready to copy.
Stand by.
Just stick it on with Velcro. We'll get it later.
Are you ready, VIII?
Stand by. We'll be ready in a second.
Roger. We're standing by.
Where the heck did the Flight Plan Book go?
Do you have that?
Yes.
Okay. Let's take a look at it. I got this one.
Okay. Go ahead.
Houston, Gemini VIII. Go ahead.
Roger. Your GET burn 02 18 25; Delta-V, 50.6; Delta-T, 1 plus 08; yaw 0, pitch 0; Core 25, 00506; Cores 26 and 27, all zeros; thrusters aft, Maneuver Posigrade.

Roger. That is correct. I hope you're enjoying your eating.
Oh, it's not bad at all.
They knew!
First meal at 1 plus 56. Saw a lot of air bubbles in the water.
I saw the first star at 1 58 - correction 2 58 30, on the second revolution. The ground well lighted...
Coming over a bright light on the ground at 2 08 28. Start ... light.

Okay.
Don't press.
...
... you had a pretty long burn.
Want to check it?
Yes.
We're going to back off and ...
...
Okay.
...
Zero, zero; you better check ...
I can't figure that 82 out.
I can't either.
...
Positive one.
... this way?
No, its not.
Now look at it.
Okay. You're right.
We were putting in 81. That's what's happened.
Gemini VIII, Carnarvon CAP COM.
Hello, Carnarvon. Gemini VIII.
How you all doing?
Okay. We completed our burn on time, and residuals were removed. The OAMS is 88 percent.
Okay. Your OAMS Prop is 80 percent?
88 percent.
88. Okay. I copy that. You activated S-3 at 2 plus 10?
Stand by.
No. We missed it.
Say again.
No. We missed it.
Hang on there.
Okay. I have a Plane-Adjust update. Let me know when you're ready to copy.
Stand by.
Okay. Go ahead.
Okay GET B 02 45 50; Delta-V, 26.2; burn time, 0 plus 35; yaw 90 right, pitch 0; Cores 25 and 26 are zeros; Core 27, 90262; thrusters aft; Maneuver South. Over.

Thank you.
...
All right.
Okay. You're looking real good. We will hang loose here and keep quiet.
Roger. Understand.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, very well.
That's 2 minutes to go.
Okay.
20 seconds until ...
Okay.
25.
30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35,
I think we overdid it a little. We should have stopped a little bit early.
31 is minus 0004.
Now according to my - turn a little left.
Okay.
Okay now ...
000 ...
Plus, over, now a little down.
...
It's in.
Okay.
Push in the little ...
...
See, I think it takes us a little while for it to work on it. To process it. That accelerometer ...
...
...
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Go ahead, Hawaii.
Roger. We have you GO and I have an Agena acquisition update when you're ready to copy.
Roger. Go ahead. I have - I'd like to have you take a look at our cabin pressure. We're presently reading 5.1.
Stand by.
Roger. We have a ground readout of 5.25.
Okay. We'll keep an eye on it.
Roger.
Go ahead with the acquisition.
Roger. GET of acquisition 3 plus 07; GET of R = 248 nm; GET rendezvous, 3 plus 15; azimuth, 0 degrees; elevation, 7 degrees; GET sunrise at TPI 05 37 00, plus or minus 1 minute. Do you copy?
Roger. Understand GET of acquisition is 03 07; GET of R = 248 nm; GET of rendezvous 03 15; azimuth, 0 degrees; elevation, 7 degrees; GET of sunrise, 05 37 00 plus or minus one for TPI. And do you have the update for Addressees 24, 53 and 54?
Negative. Stand by.
Okay.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Go ahead.
Roger. Addresses 24, 53 and 54 all nominal and we'd like to know how your burn went.
Okay. Understand. All nominal on the addresses and the burn was on time and the residuals null.
Roger. Copy.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Go ahead.
Could we get a reading on your OAMS Propellant remaining, please?
85 percent.
Copy 85. Thank you.
Roger on that.
Gemini VIII, Guaymas CAP COM.
Gemini.
Everything looks pretty good up here.
Say again, Gemini VIII.
Everything looks okay up here.
Okay. We'd like for you to send your ACQ lights OFF, Spacecraft Command 251.
Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM.
Go ahead.
Roger. We want to give you another burn here very shortly. Stand by to copy. GET B 03 03 41; Delta-V, 2 feet; Posigrade. That'll be 0°, 0°, 0° and I'm reading you 02:54.
Okay, Houston. We didn't get that. All we got was the GET burn. Say again, please.
Roger. The Delta-V is 2 feet per second, 2 plus zero.
Two feet per second.
Roger. And it's Posigrade.
Two feet, Posigrade. Is that correct?
That is correct. 0°, 0°, 0°.
Okay.
Counting 25 seconds to burn. I'll count you down.
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Burn it.
We got it.
Off, burn.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. Let me know what the results are, will you please?
Stand by.
Okay. I think we got it in and have residuals.
This is Houston. Say again, VIII.
Roger. The burn was on time and we have the residuals.
Roger. Sorry for that hurried up thing but we had some malfunction here; so we had to get you a burn in a hurry, and I just thought I'd count it down for you.
Okay. Thank you.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. How is your Platform Alinement coming along?
Stand by.
Houston, we're not in Alinment right now. Did you want us, for some reason, to aline?
Negative. We'd - Roger. We are curious how your flight - your Alinement was going since we got an extra 2 feet per second, which our tracking had indicated had to be put in, and it came at a late time, that's all.
Okay. We had not alined prior to the burn because we didn't have - we didn't think we'd have to have the burn. And we believe we still have some bias errors in the accelerometers.
Roger. Understand. And also be informed that the Agena is now configured TDA north and we were just curious how your Alinement has been going. Does it look like you've been getting good alinement?
That's correct. We have been getting good alinements.
Roger, VIII. And if you'll switch your T/M switch to REAL-TIME and DELAY-TIME for us.
REAL-TIME/DELAY-TIME.
Houston, this is VIII. Besides, we don't have a lock-on yet. So I guess we'll have to wait until we get a lock before we send you 270.
Roger. Understand you don't have a lock-on yet and you're going to wait before you send 270. Understand.
Negative. It's 251 we're going to send.
Houston, Gemini VIII.
Go ahead, VIII. This is Houston.
Roger. Would you confirm a - a fuel cell purge at this time?
Roger. Will do.
We're standing by.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. If you go to PRELAUNCH, we'll check your accelerometer bias.
Okay. Going to PRELAUNCH and you did say you wanted the fuel cell purge at this time. Is that correct?
That's right. And we're going to watch it.
Okay. We're getting intermittent lock-ons on the radar.
VIII, this is Houston. Put your Tape Playback switch to CONTINUOUS.
Roger. To CONTINUOUS.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. We're having Delta-P lights which was not unusual on GT-7 but you should not have them on GT-8. Do you have your Crossover on?
Roger. That's affirm and we have no Delta-P.
Okay. I'm kind of disappointed.
We've got a winner up here.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. Your accelerometer bias is right on and looks very good.
Okay. Thank you.
Gemini VIII, Houston.
Go ahead.
Roger. Would you place your T/M switch to REAL-TIME and ACQ and your Tape Playback switch to COMMAND?
Roger. REAL-TIME and ACQ, and Tape Playback to COMMAND.
And would you place your Cryogenic Quantity switch to ECS O<sub>2</sub>?
Roger. ECS O<sub>2</sub>.
Be advised we did get a Delta-P on the H<sub>2</sub> purge on Section 2.
Roger. The Delta-P.
And now will you place your Cryogenic switch to FUEL CELL O<sub>2</sub>?
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. Put your Cryogenic Quantity switch to FUEL CELL H<sub>2</sub>.
Roger.
Houston, Gemini VIII. Fuel cell purge complete. The Crossover is on.
Roger. Understand the fuel cell purge is complete and Cryogenic Quantity switch then to OFF, please.
Roger.
Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM. Over.
Go ahead.
I have your Coelliptic Maneuver update if you're ready to copy.
Okay. Go ahead.
GET AB 03 47 34; Delta-V, 61.6; Delta-T, 01 plus 22; yaw zero, pitch 23 degrees down; Core 25, 00567; Core 26, 00240; Core 27, all zeros; thrusters aft; Posigrade Down. Did you read?
Understand. GET ... plus 22, yaw zero, pitch 23 degrees down ...
Gemini VIII, RKV CAP COM.
...
Roger. We did not get the confirmation on that maneuver update - -
Okay NSR 03 47 34; 61.6; 01 plus 22; yaw zero, pitch 23 degrees down; 25, 00567; 26, 00240; 27, 0000; thruster aft; Posigrade Down.
Gemini VIII, RKV CAP COM. We have an update - -
Stand by one, please.
Roger, Gemini VIII. Time on that is 03 47 35 Delta-V, 61.2; Delta-T, 1 plus 22; yaw, zero degrees; pitch, 21 degrees down; Core 25, 00570; Core 26, 00224; Core 27, all zeros; thrusters aft; Maneuver Posigrade Down. Do you copy?
Roger. Understand 03 47 35; 61.2; 01 plus 22; yaw zero, pitch 21 degrees down; 25, 00570; 26, 00224; 27 all zeros; aft thrusters; Posigrade Down.
Roger. That is affirmative.
Gemini VIII, RKV CAP COM. Will you turn your Encoder off. We would like to update the Agena with a fresh load.
Coder's off, and we are making ...
Roger. Understand.
Gemini VIII, RKV CAP COM. We're going to send the ACQ lights ON to the Agena from the ground here.
Go ahead.
Roger. We have it verified by MAP.
Roger. We're getting intermittent lock-on at this time.
You may turn your Encoder back on.
Coder on.
Roger.
Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM.
This is Gemini VIII. Go ahead.
Roger. Do you have solid radar lock-on with the Agena? Over.
Houston, Gemini VIII reads you loud and clear.
Roger. Do you have solid radar lock-on with the Agena? Over.
That's affirmative. We have solid radar lock. Just a minute and I'll give you our current range.
Roger. Thank you. Sounds good.
We're indicating a 158-mile range and elevation of about 4 degrees.
Roger. Sounds good and I'm seeing about 3 minutes and 9 seconds to your burn.
Roger.
Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM. If you have time, let us know about your burn.
Okay. We're just ...
Roger.
Okay. Our burn is complete and the residuals are null.
Roger. Left-hand burn complete; residuals are null. Did not get the rest.
...
We had lock-on at about 179 miles, and we got radar boresighted at something like 156; and the needles are relatively steady; they look pretty good. The yaw needle is wavering back and forth, perhaps plus or minus 1 degree. And a note here that the trouble we've had is getting rid of the residuals. We bring the residuals down to a small number, and then the next reading they would increase, and the next reading they would decrease. It would be difficult to tell when we got to actual zero residual. The Ground said we didn't have any. The accelerometer bias had looked good, but it looks like something is getting to us here.
... Losing all star reference here at about 19 minutes. The stars are disappearing and I have ... underneath.
Gemini VIII, CSQ. Com check. How do you read? Over.
Gemini VIII, CSQ. We read you loud and clear.
Roger. We have you GO on the ground. All systems are GO.
Okay. Everything looks all right here.
Okay. What we'd like you to do is turn your Encoder off. We'd like to send the Agena load to clear out all the Agena memory.
Okay. Stand by.
Okay. The Encoder is off.
Roger. Thank you.
CSQ, Gemini VIII.
Go ahead.
Got a data point. Ready to copy?
Go ahead.
Data Point 10 4.8, 126.65, 156, 290.8, 604. Looks like we're about 5 minutes late.
Roger. Copy.
Gemini VIII, CSQ. You can turn your Encoder back on at this time.
Okay. Got it back on.
CSQ, Gemini VIII with a data point. Ready?
Roger.
Go ahead.
Number 12 6.2, 121.59, 151, 273.4, 570.
Okay. I copy.
Roger.
CSQ, Gemini VIII with another point. Ready?
Go ahead.
5.6, 119.05, 152, 273.4, 564.
Roger. That's the Data Point 13. Affirmative?
That's correct.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead, Hawaii.
Roger. We'd like you to turn the Recorder off. We're going to reconfigure the beacons and get a tape dump.
Okay. Recorder coming off.
And will you place your T/M switch to REAL-TIME/DELAY-TIME position, please?
Roger. Go ahead. Ready to copy.
Point Number 20 7.4, 101.07, 155, 216.9, 452.
Roger. Copy.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii. We'd like to get an OAMS Propellant readout when you have a minute.
75 percent.
Copy. 75.
Roger. Ready to copy.
Number 21 7.0, 98.50, 154, 207.4, 434.
Flight copies.
Hawaii, Gemini VIII with another point.
Ready to copy.
Number 22 7.4, 95.93, 159, 201.9, 421.
Roger. Copy. And you can place your T/M switch back to REAL-TIME/ACQ-AID position.
REAL-TIME/ACQ-AID.
Gemini VIII, Guaymas CAP COM. We have you GO on the ground. We are standing by.
Guaymas, Gemini VIII with a data point.
Go ahead.
Number 27 8.4, 83.26, 149, 166.9, 349.
Guaymas copy.
Gemini VIII with a point. Ready to copy?
Copy.
Number 28 9.1, 80.75, 151, 157.8, 332.
Guaymas copy.
Guaymas, Gemini VIII with a point.
Go ahead.
Number 29 8.9, 78.27, 152, 150.5, 318.
Guaymas copy.
This is Houston ...
Say again.
This is Houston. We have it and we also have your ground TPI backup when you're ready to copy.
Stand by.
Okay. We've got a visual on the Agena at 76 miles.
Roger. Understand visual on Agena, 76 miles.
At least we have some object in sight, something that looks like it could be the Agena.
Understand a visual Agena or Sirius, 76 miles.
Yes, it could be a planet.
Guaymas, Gemini VIII. Go ahead with the TPI.
Roger. GET B 05 13 13; GTNSR, 012538; Delta-V, 32.6; forward, 32.0; up, 1.7; left, 5.7; RB, 32.5; Delta RB, 131; azimuth 27.4; elevation 0.
Roger, Guaymas. Real smooth. Stand by. I'll get it back to you.
Guaymas, Gemini VIII.
This is Houston CAP COM. Go ahead, VIII.
Okay. TPI coming back at you. You ready?
All set to go.
05 13 13; 012538, 32.6, 32.0 forward, 1.7 up, 5.7 left, 32.5, 131, 27.4 on the elevation, and 0 on the azimuth. How's that?
The other way around, VIII. The azimuth is 27.4 and 0 on the elevation.
That's what I thought you said. Okay.
Otherwise, sounds good.
We'll check that, VIII. That doesn't sound right.
Roger. 27.4 on the elevation.
... Advise at 76 miles we've got what appears to be the Agena, and also we have a visual on another object which, this time, 56 minutes, is approximately 12 degrees above the Agena and appears to be in plane with it. It's possible it could be a planet.
Got a scanner?
Oh, listen, Dave, I've got to aline.
Yes. You're 10 degrees right now.
Yes. I've got to aline right now. Better quit - -
Houston. Gemini VIII with a point.
Houston, Gemini VIII.
Boy, we didn't stay with them very long, did we?
TPI is at 13 13. Right?
Does that mean that it's only 16 minutes from now?
No, no! That's - 05 13 13; 5 hours, 13 minutes and 13 seconds.
Yes. Okay. That's on this watch, which is about a half an hour from now.
That's better.
I want to read 84 now. Stay awake, Kid.
289 degrees. That doesn't look very good. Went back up. Okay. Attitude Control, PLAT; pitch down to 0°, 0°, 0°; aline for 10 minutes.
Okay. I went to PULSE because I want to get a little better alinement on the Platform. I'm going to hold it right on.
They gave us 32 feet per second - we've got an Out-Of-Plane that's pretty healthy.
5.7 degrees left.
32-feet-per-second forward; 1.7 up. So that doesn't look too bad.
Okay. We have a good solid visual on the Agena at 56 miles. I'm taking a second look at it with the sextant.
Loud and clear.
I can get an angle of this for you.
You have a terrible horizon. Better look at it and see.
That-a-boy!
The only way to fly.
... there's nothing there to look at. Doesn't hurt to try. Unable to get a horizon there.
Okay.
Gemini VIII, RKV CAP COM.
Go.
Roger. We'd like to confirm on this TPI that you did copy correctly with the elevation at 27.4 up and azimuth as 0 degrees.
Roger. We understand that. Thank you.
Roger.
We also show on the ground that the L-Band Coder is not locked.
Understand that it's not locked. Is that correct?
Roger. That's what we're showing on the ground. How are your readings going?
We have ... it's on.
Roger. Understand.
RKV, got a data point. You ready?
Roger.
Number 41 14.9, 49.78, 138, 58.7, 142.
Roger.
Also be advised that your TPI and TPF may be approximately 9 minutes late.
RKV, RKV. Gemini VIII with a data point.
Roger. Go ahead.
42 15.5, 47.74, 137, 45.2.
Roger. And would you confirm that your Encoder is on?
It's on now.
Roger. Thank you.
Going into darkness at - let's see - 05 02. We lost a visual on the Agena and I had the ACQ light right away. Range was 45 miles. It's very hard to see, but it looks like a sixth-magnitude star, I'd say.
23-30 seconds to a readout.
Gemini VIII with another point.
Roger. Go ahead.
Number 43 17.2, 45.5, 138, 34.3, 102.
Roger.
...
Close Loop. Giving us 26 forward.
Okay.
7 left, 6 up.
Okay. Attitude Control, RATE COMMAND. Maneuver Controller, ON.
Okay. Did you get - -
15 seconds till we read out.
10, - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
MARK.
Oh boy!
Are you sure you had the right angles?
Well, the radar needles were wandering around some, Dave. I can't really be sure. I was - as best I could - in the middle of the oscillation.
I get an horrendous 20 - 25-feet-per-second down, Neil.
I just can't see any possible reason for that.
What does the chart look like?
A plot. We're up above it.
Yes, but I mean does it look like - -
I can't talk to you. I've got to figure this. I'm sorry, old Buddy. I really have to look at this.
25-feet-per-second forward. Boy, oh boy! Look at it!
Look at the plot. To have 25 down we've got to have a tremendous ellipticity.
I have to start counting.
We're steady right above the line all the way.
Okay. We're going to go with the Closed Loop.
What've you got?
25 forward, 8 left, 3 up, and I'm going to RATE COMMAND.
Ready to back me on the clock?
Yes. Any time.
3, 2, 1, burn.
Good!
Did you burn at 26 10?
No. That - that's right. I got it. It was about 30 - 34 - 36, as a matter of fact.
Okay. There's 30 seconds.
Okay. Agena is in center of reticle. Attitude Control, PULSE. Set your ET to 3 minutes and stand by.
Okay. I've got it circled.
Okay. Get the Controller OFF. Okay. Now again.
Okay. I need a readout at 1 minute, which is in 20 seconds from now.
Okay.
Don't hit the Computer switch.
Right.
10 seconds. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
MARK.
Start - set your clock for 3 minutes. Can't you do that?
It gets - it's running 2 - 3 minutes now.
Set it at 3 minutes. I'll start you out.
Okay. ...
10 seconds going up to 2 minutes.
Is it 2 minutes?
Yes.
Okay. Now we're going to want to send SPIRAL ANTENNAS to the Agena.
At 5.
About 3 minutes.
No, I'm sorry. I've just got too much to do over here to catch up with you.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. You need not answer. We're standing by for information.
Gemini VIII has burned TPI on Closed Loop.
15 seconds to a readout and then 4 minutes.
Okay.
4, 3, 2, 1,
MARK.
Okay. We need a readout at 7 minutes, which is a minute from now. Is that correct?
That's correct. A minute from now.
Okay. Here goes on the antenna.
270 coming out.
Right.
270. I have a MAP.
Okay.
Yes. That gave us a little radar glitch when you did that.
That's interesting.
Yes.
Okay. I have a solution here. At 4.5, 10-feet-per-second down.
Okay.
I need a readout in 20 seconds.
4, 3, 2, 1,
MARK.
Sorry. Turn it off.
Don't have a good visual.
We're still inside the curve.
How much?
See, right there.
Hey, now it's getting our boresights up.
Think those zeros might be lagging a little bit.
Okay. 30 seconds to go.
Okay.
15.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
MARK.
Might have been a tenth lower than one you read.
Okay.
This gives me up just a little - not much.
Oh boy! This is bad!
4 forward.
And 2-1/2 up.
That sounds more like it.
Now we're getting 12 forward. 1 right, 6 up.
12 forward. 1 right.
Yes.
And 6 up?
Yes.
Your choice.
Okay. We'll burn the Closed Loop.
Okay.
Ready?
Any time.
3, 2, 1, burning.
Okay.
There's 10 seconds.
Okay.
Okay. At 13 minutes we'll need a readout, which is coming up in 15 seconds.
Okay. I'll be on.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
MARK.
It's on.
12 miles out.
Oh, that looks good!
Elliptic - we must have had an ellipticity because we're - swinging into it.
We're swinging into it?
Yes.
Okay. We're getting a little Out-Of-Plane now.
Boresight's holding pretty well.
Half-way point now.
Wasn't on very good. I was about a degree off.
Okay. I'll get it later.
You on now?
Any time you say.
Okay.
I'm about two-tenths high, I think.
Now we're getting some error ...
An error, I'm afraid.
Got a Mark in 10 seconds - about 10 seconds.
Okay.
4, 3, 2, 1,
MARK.
Range-Rate is pretty erratic, I'm afraid.
We've got to get 3 aft and 2-1/2 up.
Okay. I like that.
Still sliding out in front of me, but getting into the old slot.
Okay. I just don't like the Out-Of-Plane, but - -
Gemini VIII, CSQ. We have nothing for you. We'll be standing by.
We're on the way.
Roger.
2 1/2 miles out in Closed Loop.
Roger.
Is there any ...?
Okay. I'm losing my star background.
Okay. 2.1 miles, 45 feet per second - 49 feet per second.
You're - okay.
For this range you're in pretty good shape. You're almost nominal for this range.
Okay. I'm going to start braking down a little bit very shortly here because we're at 15K. We're inside 15K and I'd like to - -
Yes, we're inside 15K.
How about if I brake off?
Yes, I agree.
Okay. Now give me a digital range for the remainder of 20 seconds.
Okay. You're 10,000 feet.
Okay. And Range Rate?
44 feet per second, but let me get another readout on that.
Okay. I'm reading.
Ready.
36 feet per second.
We'll have the horizon coming into view pretty soon and probably the sun in our eyes. In case that happens, I'll have to go to FULL-BRIGHT on the instruments.
That's okay. Go ahead.
Okay.
It looks pretty reasonable to me.
Anything you can tell now - -
You're looking good. 8100 feet, 39 feet per second, I get.
I'd better back off a bit.
Back off ...
Yes.
Okay. 30 now.
Okay. Let me read out here.
6,000 feet.
Okay.
31 feet per second. A little high.
Okay. Let's back off a little more.
Okay.
5,500 feet.
24 feet per second.
Seems the minimum. Pretty good now.
Where did you get the Range Rate?
24 feet per second.
Pretty good.
I'll be backing down a little more now.
Okay. 22 feet per second.
...
I can't.
Can't you?
No. I'm busy.
Okay. 4,500 feet.
Okay.
17 feet per second.
3,700 feet.
What was the Range Rate?
Coming up.
19 feet per second.
Okay. I'm going to back off a little more.
Okay.
Out-Of-Plane seems to be drifting back a little bit.
Okay. You're 3,400 feet.
17 feet per second.
I'm losing my Range Rate. It's ...
You're 2,880 feet.
You did lose your Range Rate a bit, there.
...
I can see the back lights, now.
2,500 feet.
Yes. So can I.
Range Rate?
2,400 feet.
Range Rate's 10 feet per second.
You're now at 2,200 feet.
Range Rate?
Range Rate?
1,900 feet.
10 feet per second.
Put in a little ... to the left.
...
Back off now.
1,680 feet.
7 feet per second.
Okay.
Chase it down a little bit.
Gad! That's just amazing! ... camera is running.
...
...
Back to work.
You're about 1,100 feet.
5 feet per second.
You're 900 feet.
5 feet per second.
That's just unbelievable! unbelievable!
I can't believe it!
Yes, I can't either. Outstanding job, Coach!
Way to go, Partner!
You did it, boy! You did a good job!
It takes two to tango.
Say again?
It takes two of us.
Okay. We're at ...
Back off.
Okay. We're 700 feet.
11 feet per second. Let me re-do that one.
I like 7. You buy 7 feet per second?
Yes.
Boy! Look at that sucker!
That's beautiful!
See the dipole?
Do I ever! I'll say I see everything on that fellow!
I've got 18 pictures.
I don't have the range sight on. Hope I'm hitting them.
250 and 11.
Got yours set?
...
...
Yes.
I'm in 25. ...
No! Heck no!
Dang target. You should be at infinity, 1/200 and f 16.
No, we don't have a spot in here. I guess we'll have plenty of time to do that.
Okay. Now I'll get back to work.
240 feet ...
5 feet per second we're still getting.
Okay. ...
I guess we could turn the ACQ lights off.
Yes. I'll go back to the Check List.
Okay. 250 coming up.
Got a MAP?
Okay. Now 230.
Okay.
UHF DISABLED. You agree?
Yes.
Got a MAP?
Gemini VIII, Gemini VIII, this is Houston CAP COM. Standing by for any Rendezvous remarks. Over.
You tell them.
Flight Houston, this is Gemini VIII. We're Stationkeeping on the Agena at about 150 feet.
...
Yaw left ...
That's good.
Right. Now I'll get a better picture.
Got the SPOT Meter over there anywhere handy?
... It's supposed to be at the back of the box here.
Okay. Stay on the Agena. Don't sweat this one. We'll be around for a long time yet.
Okay. What does your Propellant Quantity read now?
55 percent.
That's nice.
Gemini VIII is Stationkeeping on the Agena.
Back to the Flight Plan. We just started today.
That's right.
Gemini VIII, this is Houston. You are unreadable. We will stand by for Hawaii acquisition.
Okay. We have here - I guess I can turn the radar to STANDBY.
Yes, radar STANDBY.
...
1/200 and f 16, it says in here.
We should have been there at 5 42. We were there by 5 58, so we're late - by gosh! 16 minutes.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Go ahead.
Roger. How are you doing?
Stationkeeping at about 150 feet.
Roger. Have you transmitted UHF DISABLE?
That is correct.
Roger. We have an SPC load to transmit. Would you ENABLE it, please?
Sure will.
231, coming up.
I didn't get it. We'll have to pitch down a little bit here.
We're on a radar STANDBY. No wonder.
Radar ON.
Was it STANDBY?
It was STANDBY ...
Okay.
Okay. 231.
Got a MAP?
I can't find it.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Go ahead.
Roger. Would you turn off your Encoder, please?
Okay.
Doing a little POA work up here.
Our Agena looks in fine shape. The TDA is out. It's Rigidized. The whiskers are sticking out as expected on the TDA. The dipole is up. The engine looks good. And we've turned the ACQ lights off.
Roger. Copy.
I don't believe it!
Gemini VIII. We'd also like an OAMS propellant reading.
We're at 55 percent.
Say 59?
That's 55 percent.
55. Roger.
We're standing by to copy the Agena-Status Display Panel readings.
Yes, you better get it - -
Okay. We'll have to get over on that side of it.
Better get busy - -
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Stationkeeping here.
Go ahead.
We have a Yaw Maneuver time for you, if you're ready to copy.
Okay. Go ahead.
Roger. Yaw Maneuver at 07 10 00. That's GET.
Roger. Understand. Yaw Maneuver 07 10 00.
Also, when you are at plus 96 degree heading, the Agena will go to Flight Control Mode 7 for 30 seconds.
Understand. 96 degree FC-7 for 30.
And the SPC load we're transmitting contains the Agena clock reset. We're very anxious for it to be executed even if it cuts short the Platform Parallelism.
What was that? Did you catch it?
No I didn't.
Say that last one again, please.
Roger. The SPC load we're transmitting contains a clock reset for the Agena.
Roger.
We're anxious for it to be executed - even if it means cutting the Platform Parallelism test short.
Roger. Understand. The SPC has priority over the Platform Parallelism.
In essence. Is that right?
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Man! That's great!
Man, that's really slick!
A bit of all right!
Okay. The first thing we really have to do - Platform Parallelism 06 50 to 07 10. They're giving us the SPC loaded Yaw Maneuver. It looks like at nominal time. So they're going to give you that time.
Now I'll check your little Status Display for you.
I bet those Lockheed guys are just jumping up and down.
The S-10 is on.
Yes.
Okay.
Man, it flies easy! I'd love to let you do it, but - -
Oh no!
I think I better get my practice while I can.
Man, I'll have my chance!
Get yours later. Okay?
Yes. I wouldn't even take it if you gave it to me.
It's up to you; stick with it.
More you get now, the better off you're going to be when - -
Do we have STB bright?
Should have.
I think I'll get the section here in a minute and we'll be able to see something. Let me check the systems. Cabin pressure, that's good.
Your OAMS source pressure is 190.
1900?
You always get me on those.
ECS O<sub>2</sub> is rather high. 810.
When that sun comes in, boy it is warm!
Man, this is easy!
Is it really?
This Stationkeeping, there's nothing to it.
I can't understand why our recorder isn't working.
I don't either, except maybe it's not running.
Want me to turn to OFF now?
Tape recorder is on but just doesn't budge now.
Sure does.
Oh, oh! Fuel Cell H<sub>2</sub> Heater circuit breaker popped.
I'm trying to reset it. It's reset.
Okay. Now a - this is - this is getting into Stationkeeping attitude for EDA. Boy ...
Okay. I can see the Status Display. - Main Green, Secondary HI, ON; Secondary LO, ON; Power and Attitude, ON.
Okay.
That means everything should be - -
I can't see any dark line on those - just too far away now.
Okay.
I'll give this sextant a 1/10 - a little ...
We're still - -
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Go ahead.
We'd like to know when you first saw the acquisition lights as you approached.
We'll have to go back on the data and dig that out.
Roger.
About 45 ...
No. No it's about 56 miles. Right?
No, not 56. I think it was 45 miles.
We think it was 45 miles, but we'll have to check on the tape.
Roger. Copy. And we're ready to copy the readouts if you have them now.
The readings from the Status Display Panel.
Roger. It looks like we're about a - 80 feet out still. And we have a Main Red, OFF; Main Green, ON; Armed, OFF Secondary HI, ON; Secondary LO, ON; Attitude, ON; Rigid, OFF; Power, ON; and can't quite see the dock yet.
Roger. Copy.
We're using a sextant to get those.
Understand.
Pretty bright up here.
Roger. Copy.
Okay. Now work it in - I guess the thing to do here is to Aline the Platform.
Right?
Let's see, how much time do we have?
We have an hour.
How much before RKV? How much before the SPC Yaw?
That's an hour.
An hour from now?
Yes.
But we ought to do the Platform Parallelism before then.
Pitch down so I can get the moon in that dock.
Turn around so you can be looking. (whispering) I wonder where the heck it is?
... okay. ...
Where the heck is that?
SPOT meter is in the left-hand little food box. Can you get it out?
Okay. If you could be quiet for a minute.
Let's make sure we don't drift into it.
See a scanner and everything.
Okay. She's all yours.
Now you have to keep looking, for me, for a second.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay. I'd like to get some pictures if I can - and I'd like to get some good ones.
I tried it ... Darkside is ...
It's as stable as a rock. Isn't it?
It sure - -
Can you go around and check the dock light?
What am I going to pick to Aline the Platform?
Where you going to do it?
We want to try to do the Platform Parallelism ... back off and aline it here.
Yes. You're right.
You're at 6 frames per second.
Yes.
...
While I'm here I'd like to Aline the Platform. I'm in a good position.
Okay. Just yaw left to 10 before we - -
Okay.
I can't see it now so - -
You're okay. I'll call you.
Okay. Now yaw right and you'll be okay.
You're on the wrong ...
Sorry about that.
See him?
You're okay.
Keep translating.
Why don't you go down where you can see?
Okay. Aline ... Platform.
Let's see. They didn't ever tell us to turn it back on, did they?
Hawaii, Gemini VIII.
Coder's coming on. Radar's in STANDBY anyway.
Okay now ...
We might do that now.
- - do the what?
- - take a picture of it.
Did the Index Bar extend?
Index Bar.
Oh yes, why don't you get - no, you want to stay here.
- - let's take a picture of it.
I might do that.
We're supposed to set up the Agena in Flight Control Mode 6, at 06 15 to 06 25.
Right.
Okay.
Yes.
So you want to do that?
Yes. I'll probably have to back off a little bit.
You're supposed to be alining here anyway.
I am.
Okay. It gives you an idea of what Platform-Mode Stationkeeping is like.
Yes.
It's a sort of a way - -
I'd visualized it, except a little farther back.
I can tell. I can usually see that - -
Firing thrusters?
Wait a little bit. Okay. Now drifting in a little close. Let's say I wanted to fire a little forward thruster and wanted to tell you I'm going to fire a little forward thruster and then I wait a little bit and you say okay, and then I'll say okay, now.
Like that.
Okay. Put the Bus Arm to DOCK.
For your Index Extend?
Oh. I am out of film.
... give it to me and I'll change it.
I'll get it.
I don't mind. I'll write on the one we did.
Okay.
What would you recommend for an exposure?
I'll tell you in just a minute.
A target - what lens? 18mm lens?
Yes.
1/200 and an f 16.
1/200 and an f 16. Okay.
Let's Aline the Platform.
RKV, Gemini ...
Gemini VIII, RKV.
Okay. We're sitting about 2 feet out - -
Go ahead.
- - ... We'll go ahead and dock.
Roger. Stand by for a couple of minutes here.
Okay, Gemini VIII. We have T/M solid. You're looking good on the ground. Go ahead and dock.
Okay. We're going to go ahead and dock.
Okay, Gemini VIII. It looks good here from the ground. We're showing CONE RIGID. Everything looks good for the docking.
Okay. We're going to cycle our RIGID/STOP switch now.
Roger.
Flight, we are docked!
Yes. It's a - really a smoothie.
Roger. Hey, congratulations! This is real good.
You couldn't have the thrill down there that we have up here.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Okay. Just for your information, the Agena was very stable and at the present time we are having no noticeable oscillations at all.
Roger. Copy. Agena very stable and no noticeable oscillations. Very good!
Roger.
Gemini VIII - -
- - RKV. We'd like to update that SPC load that did not get in correctly. Could you give us UHF Enable and the Encoder OFF, please?
I think we'd rather - can we send it in on the Encoder ourselves?
You just want to load an SPC again. Correct?
Roger. We did not get all the SPC load in correctly over Hawaii, and we want to finish the SPC load from here.
And you can not do that from where you are.
Do you copy, Gemini VIII?
Yes. We copy. We're just discussing it a little bit.
Okay. We're going to go along with you on that, and want you to make double sure that you get the right load.
Roger. Wilco. We sure will.
And be advised, Gemini VIII, the SPC at the present time is Disabled, so regardless of what your load does, we'll still be okay.
We'd like you to make double sure.
Roger.
Okay. Can you give us the Encoder OFF, please?
It's off.
Roger. Thank you. We are sending the SPC loads.
Okay, Gemini VIII. The SPC's are in. We have reset the Reset Timer, and you may have control back again.
Thank you very much.
Roger.
Gemini VIII, we would also like to send the V/M word. Would you turn the Encoder off, please?
Okay. Encoder off.
Roger. We're transmitting the V/M now.
Okay. Turn the Encoder back on.
Gemini VIII, RKV. We're about to have LOS. You're looking real good from the ground. Congratulations on Rendezvous and Docking.
Okay.
Thank you, Scotty.
...
Gemini, Scotty confirmed DCC Flight Test CONTINUOUS?
Affirmative. Flight Test to CONTINUOUS.
Minus 3 minutes and counting. CM1.
We just completed yawing the Agena to 090 and yaw was at precisely at 1 1/2 degrees per second on the Yaw Maneuver, and it took ... seconds to go 90 degrees. The Gemini Platform has - may have drifted excessively since the last time we alined it; see, it was almost an hour ago.
Yes, that's right.
The alinements are from 06 13 to 06 23 - let's see - we contend that it was the Agena and control systems.
Gemini VIII, Gemini VIII, Houston CAP COM. Over.
This is Gemini VIII. A - -
Roger, VIII. Reading you loud and clear. I have some information for you. Ready to copy?
Stand by.
What kind of information is it?
Well, first of all, it's about the SPC Yaw Maneuver. I have some dope for you to follow.
Do you mean the SPC Yaw Maneuver?
Roger. We believe we have the load in and we would like to have you ENABLE the SPC's and let the Agena start coming through. If you run into trouble and the Attitude Control System in the Agena goes wild, just send in Command 400 to turn it off and take control with the Spacecraft. Did you copy that?
Roger. We understand.
Roger. Okay. Stand by.
I have a nodal update for you.
Stand by.
Got to get the right book.
Go ahead.
Roger. Node 07 04 46; Rev 5; 67.5 east; 15 plus 52, right ascension.
Roger. Understand. Node 07 04 46; Rev 5; 67.5 east; 15 plus 52, right ascension.
Roger. That's correct. And would you verify that the L-Band radar is off, please?
Roger. We should have OFF command. Do you want us to do it again?
No. This is the Spacecraft L-Band radar.
Roger. The L-Band in the transponder is off.
Roger. Thank you. And would you put the ECS O<sub>2</sub> heater off?
Okay. Going off.
Roger. And T/M down here is saying that the Fuel Cell O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> Heater circuit breaker had opened up during the Pacific pass and we would like to know if Dave found that circuit breaker open, and did he reset it after Hawaii?
That's affirmative. He did find it open and he did reset it after Hawaii.
Roger. Big Brother is watching.
Say again.
And could you give us an OAMS Propellant Quantity readout, please?
Okay. 51 percent right now.
Roger. 51 percent. Thank you.
Now we yawed around to 180 now for the Parallelism Check. It's gone real well.
Understand. You've yawed to 180 for the Parallelism Check.
Right.
Tananarive has LOS.
Gemini VIII, CSQ CAP COM. Com Check. How do you read?
We have serious problems here. We're - we're tumbling end over end up here. We're disengaged from the Agena.
Okay. We got your SPACECRAFT FREE indication here.
Say again.
We're showing your SPACECRAFT FREE.
What seems to be the problem?
We're rolling up and we can't turn anything off.
Continuously increasing in a left roll.
Roger.
Gemini VIII, CSQ.
Stand by.
We have a violent left roll here at the present time and we can't turn the RCS's off, and we can't fire it, and we certainly have a roll. ... stuck hand control.
Roger.
Okay. We're regaining control of the Spacecraft slowly, in RCS DIRECT.
Roger. Copy.
We're pulsing the RCS pretty slowly here so we don't control roll right. We're trying to kill our roll rate.
Okay. Fine. Keep at it.
VIII, CSQ. How much RCS have you used and are you just on one ring?
That's right. We are on one ring, trying to save the other ring. We started with two rings, but now we are on one ring.
Roger. What about RCS usage?
Now okay. We're down to 1700 pounds right now on RCS B.
Roger.
We now have about - have about 2350 on A.
Okay. Copy.
VIII, CSQ. How are you doing?
We're working on it.
Okay. Relax. Everything's okay.
The Spacecraft-Agena combination took off. Yaw and roll, and we had ACS OFF and affirmative 7 hours.
Roger. Understand. Can you see the Agena now?
... up. We turned the Spacecraft system on, tried to stabilize, and in so doing we may have burned out our lower left thrusters.
Okay. I copy. Can you - do you have visual sighting of the Agena right now?
No. We haven't seen the Agena since we undocked a little while ago.
Okay.
The ... - -
- - ... ACS was shut off and a MAP was achieved.
Roger.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Hello Hawaii, Gemini VIII.
Roger. We'd like a readout on your switch positions and OAMS, and on-board reading of your OAMS remaining. Over.
Okay. We have 22 percent showing on the gage. We don't have any yaw or roll control, and cannot regain control of the yaw thrusters, apparently none of them. We do have - apparently the pitch thrusters are operative. And also, we're slowly getting back to the proper attitude here.
Roger. Copy, Gemini, and be advised they're planning to come into a -3 area. They're looking into 6 or 7-3 at this time. They would like you to enter Module 4 and the ATM computer. Over.
Okay. We'll go ahead and do that.
And also get into Retro Attitude as soon as possible. Over.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Go ahead.
Roger. Which systems are you using now? OAMS or RCS?
We're on OAMS right now.
Roger. And do you have any problem at all with the RCS control?
In DIRECT we're okay. We haven't really thoroughly checked out the RCS. That's the only way we got it to fire a while ago.
Roger. Copy.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Go ahead.
Roger. We'd like you to place your Entry C-Band beacon to CONTINUOUS and Flight advises they personally prefer 7-3. That will give you approximately 1 1/2 more hours.
Okay. We do have the Spacecraft under control at the present time. We're in slowly drifting flight - do have a slight amount of control. We have - 1550 pounds showing on RCS B and 2400 on A.
Say again on B, please.
1550.
Copy.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii.
Go ahead.
Do you have any idea of the Agena position at present? Over.
We saw it about 10 minutes ago. It looked to be a mile or so underneath us.
Roger. Copy. Would you place your T/M switch to REAL-TIME/ACQ-AID, please?
REAL-TIME/ACQ-AID.
Could you give us a sequence of events on just what happened? Over.
It happened when we were in Agena-Spacecraft combination of 0°, 180°, 0° and we were stabilized there. We had the Attitude Control Power off in the Spacecraft, OAMS Attitude Control Power off and we sent 041 Command to Agena to turn the recorder on. The Spacecraft-Agena combination started a violent roll.
Gemini VIII, RKV CAP COM.
Go ahead RKV, Gemini VIII.
Roger. Do you have any idea where the Agena is?
No, we haven't seen it.
Okay.
Over Hawaii, we were having LOS at the time that you were giving us your switch positions. We copied as far as you had sent Commmnd 041 RECORDER ON, and at that time the Spacecraft started to roll. Would you continue from there, specifically what your on-board switch positions were and what you did with it?
We had Attitude Control POWER on and went to RATE COMMAND.
Roger.
And when we started to yaw - it seems that it was the Agena control system.
Roger.
Since we did not hear any of our thrusters fire.
Roger.
Stand by ...
And we sent ACS OFF and turned the Spacecraft power on, OAMS power on, and tried to regain control of the combination.
Roger.
And we were just barely able to hold our own, but the rates were too excessive for an undocking, so we continued to attempt to send an ACS OFF-cycle ... and at the same time we checked our OAMS switch position.
Roger.
We switched it - we tried to turn our own Spacecraft Control System off and the combination continued to wind up, so we had to go back on before the rates became intolerable.
Roger.
After we got the rates down to a point where we felt we could safely undock, we did so, and maneuvered away from the Agena at several feet per second as quickly as possible. We had been watching our propellant quantity go down from 50 to below 30 percent. After turning the OAMS off and still in bias power and everything - motor valves off, we were still rolling; we activated the RCS. Did not have any ACME, and we regained control of the Spacecraft in DIRECT, slowly.
Roger.
Then after getting stabilized, we checked out our whole Thrust Control System and found that we had no yaw or roll control - or we had no yaw control of the yaw thrusters since our roll was in the yaw jets, and after that - -
- - we had - vision; we could see the ACS thrusters firing on the Agena when we had ACS off, so we felt that something was definitely wrong.
Roger.
After checking the Spacecraft systems we found Thruster Number 8 apparently failed OPEN at the present time and this could have been true at the time of the incident, although we can't - cannot verify that at this time.
Roger. Stand by. We'll update that new T<sub>R</sub> time.
Got it.
Okay. And I'd also like to send your Load.
Reentry Load.
DCS light on.
The ATM okay?
ATM has loaded Module 4A and verified 4A.
Roger ...
Roger. We're having LOS. We haven't updated your Load and T<sub>R</sub>.
Okay.
Okay. Did he have that - -
What's the T<sub>R</sub>?
T<sub>R</sub> time is for Area 7-3, which is approximately an hour and 15 minutes from now.
What's our next AOS?
Next AOS should be CSQ.
Give us a time for that, please.
8 52, T<sub>R</sub> is at 9 - -
Roger. Should be 8 hours, 52 minutes - 8 hours, 52 minutes.
Okay. Thank you.
We're in the process of restowing for Reentry.
Gemini VIII, RKV. Did you blow the OAMS REG switch?
No, we have not yet. We thought about it but we don't need to yet, I guess.
Roger.
Oh shoot! How am I ever going to stow that visor? I've got to put the TV monitor in, too.
Yes, I know you do.
Do you want to do that before you get too tied up?
We should have asked them about purging the fuel cells.
Yes. Well, let's go ahead and do it.
Purging fuel cells at 8 minutes and 8 seconds - correction, that's 8 hours, 18 minutes.
Gemini VIII, CSQ. Com check. How do you read?
Read you loud and clear. How us?
We read you loud and clear. We have a new T<sub>R</sub> and Load for you.
Okay. The T<sub>R</sub> we have is counting up.
Say again.
The T<sub>R</sub> we have is counting up.
The T<sub>R</sub> you've got is counting up. The one we've got is counting down, so don't sweat it. Verify that Module 4A is loaded.
We loaded it and verified it. ...
Okay. Is your Preretro Check List complete?
We just finished it up; continuing stowage procedure.
Okay. What about your left Secondary O<sub>2</sub>? Verify that it is open.
...
Okay. I'm about to transmit a T<sub>R</sub> to you.
Okay. Go ahead. Got it.
Roger. Verified on the ground. Transmitting a Load.
...
Okay. I have some MDIU quantities for you. First of all let's see the ... message.
...
Stand by a second.
Okay.
The T<sub>R</sub> is ...
Roger.
Okay. Area 7-3 GET RC, 10 04 47; RET, 400K, 22 plus 02; RET RB, 28 plus 15; bank left 50, bank right 60. Did you copy?
Roger. Understand. Area 7-3 GET RC, 10 04 47; RET 400K, 22 plus 02; RET RB, 28 plus 15; bank left 50, right 60.
Roger. I have some MDIU cores for you.
Go ahead.
Core 03,33649; Core 04,64690; Core 65,01059; Core 66,65460; Core 07,34726; Core 08,40866; Core 09,31745; Core 10,02510; Core 11,13600. Do you copy?
Roger. Was that third one 654 or 054?
65.
Okay. Coming back at you 03,33649; 04,64690; 65,01059; ..., 07,34726; 08,40866; 09,31745; 10,02510; 11,13600.
Okay. One correction there. That Core 66,65460.
Roger. 65460.
That's affirmative.
How about 669?
Will you verify that your T<sub>R</sub>-256 circuit breaker is closed?
It's open at the present time.
Okay. Would you close it?
Okay. Coming closed.
Okay. We'd like to know what you'd prefer - what Attitude Control Mode you'd prefer at Retrofire.
I guess we don't have any choice. Okay. We'll try the ACME and if that works we'll go to RATE COMMAND on the RCS. Okay. We'll Aline the Platform.
Okay. Have you performed the evaluation on the RCS in the ACME position?
We're completing our re-storage. The re-storage is essentially completed at this time. It will be, for all practical purposes, the same as the launch configuration, or at least ...
Okay. We want you to set your Event Timer to 15 minutes and RKV will get a counting for you.
Okay. Now what was that Retrofire time again?
Okay. GET RC, 10 04 47.
Okay. About an hour from now. ...
Roger.
I can give you RKV acquisition time, if you'd like.
Yes. Go ahead, please.
Okay.
Okay. 09 44 37.
Roger. How about a GET time hack?
Okay. We'll give you the GET time hack at 09 01 00.
...
Let me give you a Mark at 45. We're about to have LOS.
MARK.
We're with you.
Okay.
We'll pass up the IVI's, MI's and update the channel and all that jazz from RKV.
Gemini VIII, Hawaii CAP COM.
Go ahead, Hawaii. Gemini VIII.
Roger. The Agena Acquisition lights have been turned on and if you happen to see it we'd like an estimate on its position.
Roger. Understand.
And also we would like to know if you have verified the Rate Command Mode. Over.
Affirmative. We have verified the Rate Command Mode.
Roger. And I have some Reentry data when you are ready to copy.
Go ahead.
Roger. The IVI aft, 292; left-right, 0; up - down, 100.
Is that up or down?
That should be down.
That's 110 ... up.
Aft 292, down 100.
Correction. That's 110 up.
No! Down!
That is probably 110 down.
Okay. That's correct, Gemini. It was corrected by Flight, that it is down.
Okay. R<sub>N</sub>, R<sub>P</sub>, plus 77, pitch angle at 400 foot nominal; correction, 400K foot nominal; RET 400K feet, 22 plus 02; beginning of blackout, 24 plus 43; end of blackout, 30 plus 01; Drogue Chute, 31 plus 37; Main Chute, 32 plus 58. And I have your recovery area weather and so forth for you, if you're ready to copy.
Let me read these back to you. R<sub>N</sub> minus R<sub>P</sub>, plus 77; pitch for 400K, nominal; RET 400K, 22 plus 02; ETO, 24 plus 43; end blackout, 30 plus 01; Drogue, 31 plus 37; Main, 32 plus 58.
That's correct.
Okay. I'm ready for the rest of it.
Stand by one.
Gemini VIII. R<sub>N</sub> minus R<sub>P</sub> plus 77 is at a bank angle of 50.
Roger. Read you. Bank angle is 50.
I understand you're ready to copy your landing.
Go ahead.
Roger. 5,000 scattered; winds northwest 10; wave height 3 feet; altimeter 2986; recovery forces call sign Naha RESCUE 1, GMT 02 58; Nahe SEARCH 1, GMT 03 44; USS Mason destroyer, no ETA; Spacecraft sunrise at elapsed time of 10 08 40; dark horizon at Retrofire. A light horizon at 400K. And your on-board - correction - your on-board curve for computing backup bank angles and your initial downrange deflection are valid. Do you copy?
Okay. Understand. Start Retrofire, ... sunrise 10 08 40. And understand copy the weather, the altimeter 2986, Recovery Naha RESCUE 1 at a GMT of 02 58; Naha SEARCH 1 at a GMT of 03 44; Destroyer Mason, no ETA.

You're right. Man, this is beautiful
This is Friendship Seven. Have eaten one tube of food, shutting the visor. I've had no problem at all eating. Oh, the sun is coming up behind me in the periscope, a brilliant, brilliant red. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. It's blinding through the scope on clear. It's started up just as I gave you that mark; I'm going to the dark filter to watch it come on up.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. I'll try to describe what I'm in here. I am in a big mass of some very small particles, that are brilliantly lit up like they're luminescent. I never saw anything like it. They round a little; they're coming by the capsule, and they look like little stars. A whole shower of them coming by.
They swirl around the capsule and go in front of the window and they're all brilliantly lighted. They probably average maybe 7 or 8 feet apart, but I can see them all down below me, also.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Can you hear any impact with the capsule? Over.
Negative, negative. They're very slow; they're not going away from me more than maybe 3 or 4 miles per hour. They're going at the same speed I am approximately. They're only very slightly under my speed. Over.
They do, they do have a different motion, though, from me because they swirl around the capsule and then depart back the way I am looking.
Are you receiving? Over.
There are literally thousands of them.
This is Friendship Seven. Am I in contact with anyone? Over.

This is Friendship Seven. This is Friendship Seven, broadcasting in the blind again on HF.
This is Friendship Seven, broadcasting in the blind. Sunrise has come up behind in the periscope. It was brilliant in the scope, a brilliant red as it approached the horizon and came up; and just as the--as I looked back up out the window, I had literally thousands of small, luminous particles swirling around the capsule and going away from me at maybe 3 to 5 miles per hour. Now that I am out in the bright sun, they seem to have disappeared. It was just as the sun was coming up. I can still see just a few of them now, even though the sun is up some 20° above the horizon.

Roger. Friendship Seven. Will give blood pressure check. I still have some of these particles that I cannot identify coming around the capsule occasionally. Over.
Roger. How big are these particles?
Very small, I would indicate they are on the order of 16th of an inch or smaller. They drift by the window and I can see them against the dark sky. Just at sunrise there were literally thousands of them. It looked just like a myriad of stars. Over.
Roger. Are they moving by you or floating with you? Over.
Some of them almost float with me. Most of them appear to be moving at about 3 to 5 miles an hour away from me. I'm going just a little faster then they are. Over.

Friendship Seven, Cap Com. Would you give us the difficulty you've been having in yaw in ASCS? Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. I'm going on fly-by-wire so I can control more accurately. It just started as I got to Guaymas, and appears to be it drifts off in yaw, to the right at about 1° per second. It will go over to an attitude of about 20°, and hold at that and when it hits about a 20° point it then goes into orientation mode and comes back to zero, and it was cycling back and forth in that mode. I am on fly-by-wire now and controlling manually. Over.
Roger. Understand. Do you have a retrofire time for 2 Bravo and 2 Charlie?
This is Friendship Seven. Negative.
OK, 2 Bravo, 01 50 00; 2 Charlie, 02 05 59. Over.
Ah, this is Friendship Seven. Understand 1 Bravo is 01 plus 50 plus 00; 2 Charlie, correction 2 Bravo is 01 50 00, 2 Charlie is 02 plus 05 plus 59. Is that affirm?
That is affirmative. Standby one, please.
This is Friendship Seven. What appears to have happened is, I believe, I have no one pound thrust in left yaw. So it drifts over out of limits and then hits it with the high thrust. Over.
Roger, Seven, we concur here. Recommending you remain fly-by-wire.
Roger, remaining fly-by-wire.
Seven, this is Cape. The President will be talking to you and while he is talking I'll be sending Z and R cal.

Roger, fuel is 60-85 [percent]. Over.
Friendship Seven, how do you read us on UHF? Over.
Roger. Loud and clear; I am still on HF. Over.
Friendship 7, Muchea Cap Com. Recommend you go UHF. Over.
Roger, going to UHF.
Friendship Seven, Muchea Cap Com. How now? Over.
Friendship Seven, this is Muchea Cap Com. How are read now? Over.
Hello, Muchea. Friendship Seven. Read you loud and clear; how me?
Loud and clear. You were coming in slightly garbled. Could you give us your fuel, oxygen and amps? Over.
Roger. Fuel, 60-85 [percent]; oxygen, 65-100 [percent]; amps, 22. Over.
Roger. Exhaust temperature?
Exhaust temperature 50 [degrees]. Over.
Roger. Are you in fly-by-wire?
Negative, I am on manual at present time. I'm down to 60 [percent] on automatic fuel, so I cut it off and I'm on manual at present time. Over.
Roger. How is your yaw thruster problem? Over.
This is Friendship Seven. I am getting some erratic indications in all axes. When I align everything on orbit attitude by the instruments I am considerably off where I should be. I'm rolled some 20° to the right; I'm also yawed to the right a little bit. Over.
Roger, understand. Are you satisfied with the fly-by-wire and manual proportional systems? Over.
Fly-by-wire is not functioning in yaw low right. Over.
Roger, low yaw right.
That's affirmative. When I first had trouble with it, it was malfunctioning in low yaw left, and now low yaw left is operating okay, but low yaw right is not operating. Over.
Roger. Have you tried caging your gyros and re-erecting them. What do you think about this? Over.
Negative, have not yet. I want to get an alignment as soon as I get back in daylight and do just exactly that. I think my, I'm probably not--my scanners are probably not working right. Over.
Roger. Will you confirm the Landing Bag switch is in the off position? Over.
That is affirmative. Landing Bag switch is in the center off position.
You haven't had any banging noises or anything of this type at higher rates?
Negative.
They wanted this answer. Do you have your retrosequence times 2 Dog, Easy, and Golf from Indian Ocean Ship?
Standby one. Yes, 2 Easy, and Golf, yes, I do have those.
Roger.
Do you have any, are you ready for Z and R Cal? Over.
Affirmative, go ahead.
Cal coming through.
Any comments on weightlessness, etc.
Negative, I have no ill effects whatsoever. I don't even really notice it now. I'm just, very comfortable.
Fine.
I have the constellation of Orion up here in the window now. I'm holding a position on it.
Roger, good. Your 150 VA is 200 [degrees]; your 250 VA is 190 [degrees]. Over.
Roger.
R Cal, coming now.
Friendship Seven, Muchea Cap Com. Do you still have high, both high thrusters in fly-by-wire? Over.
That's affirmative, I do.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, Woomera Cap Com. We have contact, TM solid and UHF solid. Over.
Roger, Woomera.
Friendship Seven, are you ready to go ahead with this 30-minute report? Over.
Negative, not just at the moment. Stand by.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, Muchea. Just a reminder to take your exercise after the blood pressure. Over, Woomera.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, Woomera Cap Com. Do you read? Over.
Go ahead, Woomera.
The Cape advises that you conduct this horizon check and cage the gyros, before California.
Say again, please, Woomera, did not understand.
Cape advises that you conduct this horizon check, and cage the gyros before California contact. Over.
Roger, understand before California contact.
Roger. Would like to confirm your control systems status, fly-by-wire low yaw right is inoperative.
That's affirmative.
Good in all axes. Over.
That is affirmative
Can you give status on your ASCS|ASCS system? Over.
This is Friendship Seven. ASCS|ASCS started out operating, it would drop into orientation mode in yaw and that would throw the other axes out. It was doing this for a while it world drift off slowly, yaw right and there would be no correction until it went out about 20° . Then it would come rapidly back across and correct itself from a 20° right attitude, would come back across to a left attitude in orientation mode. This continued for a while. I took control, that was right after Guaymas. By the time I had gone over Africa the condition had just reversed, had just reversed. The same thing, only the other direction. Over.
Roger, I understand.
Friendship Seven, if you're ready, could we conduct this 30 minute report? Over.
Friendship Seven. Roger. All switch fuses still same position. Squib is armed. Auto Retrojettison is off. ASCS|ASCS mode selector is normal, rate command, gyro, normal. Manual fuel handle is pulled. Automatic fuel is still on. Retro-Delay, normal, Landing Bag is off. Everything else on sequence panel is normal. Fuel. ...
Could we have a blood pressure check? Start your button, then exercise the bungee cord, then start your blood pressure check again. Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven. Blood pressure coming on.
Roger, Friendship Seven. We're reading your blood pressure, what kind of result on your visual acuity test? Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven. Visual acuity still good. Can read same lines I did when starting out. Over.
Roger. Would like to go through this 30-minute report again, starting with the Auto Retro-jett switch. Go ahead.
Auto Retro-jettison is armed. I'm having to break this in the middle because I need to keep looking out the window to control accurately. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. ... discussion. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. Auto Retro-jettison is off. ASCS|ASCS mode selector is normal, rate command, gyro normal. All "T" handles are in except manual, and it is out. I am controlling manually at present time. Landing Bag switch is off. Sequence panel is all normal except for that. The control fuel is 60-82 [percent]. Attitudes at present time on manual control are roll 5 [degrees] right, yaw 15 [degrees] right, pitch --34 [degrees] in orbit attitude. My time from launch is 2 plus 33 plus 60, MARK! Correction that would be 2 plus 34 on that mark. Did you receive? Over.
Yes.
Roger. Cabin pressure is 5.5 and holding. Cabin air is 95 [degrees]. Cabin excess water light is still on. I'm turning it down a little bit more yet.
Cabin relative humidity is indicating 20 [percent]. Coolant quantity is 66 [percent]. Suit is 68 [degrees] on temperature, pressure 5.8 indicated, steam temperature, 50 [degrees] in suit circuit and comfortable. Oxygen is 65-100 [percent] amps 20. Voltages: main 24, 25, 25, 25; standby one is 25, 25; isolated 29; and back on main. Fans is 113, ASCS|ASCS 113. I have two warning lights on, the excess cabin water and fuel quantity. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Aeromed would like to know whether you have conducted your exercise on bungee cord. Over.
Negative, I have not done that recently. Will conduct that now as part of this check. You had a blood pressure.
You are fading now. Standby for Canton in a few minutes. This is Woomera Cap Com, Over and Out.
Okay, exercise conducted. Blood pressure starting.
This is Friendship Seven. Woomera, are you still receiving me? Over.
This is Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, Canton Com Tech.
Hello Canton Com Tech. Friendship Seven. How did you receive UHF-HI? Over.
Friendship Seven, Canton Com Tech. Reading you loud and clear. Standby for Cap Com.
Roger. Canton Cap Com, Friendship Seven. Fuel 62-75 [degrees], oxygen 65-98 [percent], correction 65-100 [percent], amps 23. My condition is good. The sunrise is coming around the capsule right now. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. This is Canton. We have TM solid; go ahead, Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven, and now that the sunrise is starting, I have all these little particles coming around the capsule again, just at sunrise.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
I also can see the light on my, on steam from the thruster when I operate it. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Are, are your thrusters working, are all your high thrusters working okay. Over.
This Friendship Seven. Affirmative, operating okay.
This is Friendship Seven. I think my, I can see a little bit of steam spitting against the dark sky here occasionally from my pitch down manual thruster. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. All these little particles; there are thousands of them; and they're not coming from the capsule. They're something that's already up there because they're all over the sky. Way out I can see them, as far as I can see in each direction almost.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, this is Canton. Our telemetry here indicates that everything is okay. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, this is Canton. Our Aeromed would like to hear any comments you have on weightlessness, nausea, dizziness, taste and smell sensations. Over.
Friendship Seven, I have no sensations at all from weightlessness except very pleasant. No ill effects at all, I'm not sick; feel fine. I have had no, no dizziness: I've run the head checks, the head movements and have no problem with that. I've run the oculogyric check and have no problem with that. I haven't been able to use much of the equipment this orbit, however. I've been mainly concerned with this control problem. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Our fuel quantities here agree with yours. Our 150 fans inverter temperature is 200 [degrees]. The ASCS|ASCS temperature is 190 [degrees]. Out
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, this is Canton. Do you have all the retro times that you need? Over.
This is Friendship Seven. I believe so. I have Foxtrot coming up here, I mean Golf coming up, at 03 00 39. Is that affirm?
Standby one.
This is Friendship Seven. I'm trying to get some pictures of these particles that are outside here. Over.
Friendship Seven, that time we have for Golf is 03 00 39. Over.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, this is Canton. We also have no indication that your landing bag might be deployed. Over.
Roger. Did someone report landing bag could be down? Over.
Negative, we had a request to monitor this and to ask you if you heard any flapping, when you had high capsule rates. ...
Negative.
... this was. Over.
Well, I think they probably thought these particles I saw might have come from that, but these are, there there are thousands of these things, and they go out for, it looks like miles in each direction from me and they move by here very slowly. I saw them at the same spot on the first orbit. Over.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, what control mode are you in presently?
This is Friendship Seven. I am in manual. While on the dark side, I aligned myself with the horizon, when up to 0 0 0, and caged the gyros and uncaged again. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Will be losing contact any minute now, you have reentry checks to make and approximately 10 minutes, until California contact. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, this is Hawaii Com Tech on UHF and HF. How do you read? Over.
Say again, Com Tech, what station?
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Com Tech on UHF and HF. How do you read? Over.
Hello Hawaii. Loud and clear; how me? Over.
Hello Hawaii. Friendship Seven. Loud and clear; how me? Over.
Friendship Seven, this is Hawaii Cap Com, I read you loud and clear. What is your status report? Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven, ah.
He has contact, we're putting air-to-ground on.
This is Friendship Seven. Fuel 62-74 [percent], oxygen 64-98 [percent], amps 23. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. The first part of your transmission was broken up; could you say again, fuel?
Roger, fuel 62-74 [percent]. Over.
Roger. Read 62-74 [percent], Friendship Seven. Cape would like to know if you have made the visual check on the gyros yet?
This is affirmative. During the dark side I went to 0 0 0 as best I could and caged and uncaged the gyros. I'm rechecking this at present time. Over.
Roger. I'll stand by until you complete your checks and we'd like to get the results.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Hawaii, this is Friendship Seven. Are we getting scanner ignore? Over.
There are no ignore indications on the ground as of now, Friendship Seven. Hawaii. Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. When I aligned in, standby one.
This is Friendship Seven. Roll appears to be about 20° off. At present time, I am indicating 20° right roll when I am lined up perfectly with the horizon. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Understand you still have a 20° error in your attitude indication after caging the gyros.
This is Friendship Seven. That's affirmative. It's drifted off again. It was correct at that time; it apparently has drifted off. It's about 20° off in roll.
Friendship Seven, could you give us a readout on all three axes; we'd like to compare ground readouts.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Roll indicates 19 [degrees] right, yaw, 2 [degrees] left, pitch --22 [degrees]. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Read you loud and clear.
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. Can you estimate the drift rates you are getting?
This is Friendship Seven. Drift rates are very difficult to pick up for some reason. I have not been able to get real accurate drift rates. I feel that. ...
Do you still consider yourself GO for the next orbit?
That is affirmative, I am GO for the next orbit.
Roger, I understand. At present time ground concurs.
Roger.
Could you, could you give me a readout on exhaust temperature, please?
Friendship Seven. Roger. Exhaust temperature, 47 [degrees].
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. Could you read exhaust temperature please?
Roger. Exhaust temperature 47 [degrees].
Roger. Understand 47 [degrees].
Surgeon requests a blood pressure readout if convenient at this time.
Roger 47 [degrees].
Correction, Roger, blood pressure, 47 [degrees] on steam temp, blood pressure on.
This is Friendship Seven. I have a pretty good run here on, on yaw check. I believe my yaw is pretty accurate. Roll is off by about 20° to the right at present time.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Roll is off by 20° to the right; yaw looks pretty good. Hawaii. Over.
That's affirmative.
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. MCC|MCC confirms that they are GO at the present time for third orbit.
Roger. Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Hawaii. Loud and clear, how me?
Are you ready to copy?
Friendship Seven. Go ahead.
This is Friendship Seven. I have a better alignment now on the day side, I believe, on these, on the attitude. I will probably cage and uncage gyros again. Over.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is California Com Tech, California Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Roger, California Com Tech. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Hello, California Com Tech. Friendship Seven. How me? Over.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is California Com Tech, California Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Roger, California Com Tech. Friendship Seven. How me? Over.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is California Com Tech, California Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Hello, California Com Tech. Friendship Seven. Loud and clear; how me?
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is California Com Tech, California Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Hello, California Com Tech. Friendship Seven. Loud and clear; how me?
Friendship Seven, California Cap Com. Read you loud and clear, John.
Say again. You came in garbled that time. This is Friendship Seven.
Friendship Seven, this is California Cap Com. We read you loud and clear; how me?
Roger. Receiving you much better now, Wally. Very good. Fuel is 62-62 [percent], oxygen 62-95 [percent], amps are 25. All systems are still go. I have had some erratic ASCS|ASCS operation. I caged and uncaged on the night side and it appears to be working fairly well now although I was drifting again in roll a moment ago. It appears to have corrected itself in roll, however, without me caging again now. Over.
Good, John. We have a go all the way on this. I'd like to give you your inverter temperatures. Your fans are 215 [degrees], your ASCS|ASCS 198 [degrees]. We're not going to do anything about them. Looks real good.
Okay, fine.
Will you give me your attitudes and we'll check those with ground.
Roger. I'll go back into orbit attitude, drifting toward it at present time. Do you have TM solid now? Over.
Good here.
Roger. Roll is 5 [degrees] left, yaw 3 [degrees] right, pitch -- 32 [degrees], right now.
Roger, have your readings.
John, we check almost right on the button with your attitudes within 2°.
Roger. I appear to have a little bit of drift in the scope yet though.
Roger. You probably don't have a good reference yet, do you?
It's rather, it's more difficult to pick up drift than I thought it would be. Your best drift really is to look out the window and try and get something moving away from you out the window.
Roger, I've got you there.
You understand that your capsule elapsed time is running about a second slow compared to GET.
No, I did not; I was not aware of that on the elapsed time.
Roger. This will affect your sequence time. I'll give you 3 Alpha if you're ready to copy.
Standby.
Roger, ready to copy 3 Alpha.
Roger. 3 Alpha corrected for the second error will be 03 plus 11 plus 26. Over.
Roger, 03 11 26.
You have your end-of-orbit time, and that has not changed and I believe you have Area Golf also.
That's affirmative. I have Golf at 03 plus 00 plus 39 and Hotel at 04 plus 32 plus 40.
That is correct. You can correct your Area Golf by subtracting one second and subtract one second from Hotel.
Roger. Understand for my retrosequence for end-of-mission is 04 plus 32 plus 39. Is that affirm?
Negative. That should be 04 plus 32 plus 38.
Plus 38. Roger. Does Cape want me to set that into clock at present time? Over.
Negative, we have not had those instructions. I'll have Arnie check for you.
Roger. I am still operating on prelaunch time of 04 plus 32 plus 28. Over.
Understand.
This is Friendship Seven. Coming across the Gulf of Lower California at present time in the scope.
Roger.
John, for your information, the clocks will be set over Canaveral.
Roger, understand clocks will be set by command, is that affirm, or do they want...
That is negative. They, on contact with Al, they will have you change the clock.
Roger, understand. Friendship Seven.
For your information your O2 is holding. It seems to be working; it's reading about
Roger, Friendship Seven. Cabin temperature is holding steady at about 90 [degrees]. I still have excess cabin water light on and my, I have the cabin water turned almost completely off at present time.
Roger, it sounds like it's working out all right anyway.
Roger, it's doing okay. We'll make one more orbit okay.
I assume you are still on manual proportional; is that correct?
That's affirmative, I'm still on manual.
Friendship Seven, Guaymas Cap Com reads you loud and clear. Over.
Roger, Guaymas. Read you loud and clear, also.
John, the Aeromeds are real happy with you; you look real good up there.
Ali right, fine, glad everything is working out. I feel real good, Wally. No problems at all.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Texas Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Texas, this is Friendship Seven. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Roger, reading you five square on HF. Let's try UHF. Over.
This is Friendship Seven, I'm on UHF. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven, Roger. Standby for Cap Com.
Roger.
This is Texas Cap Com, Friendship Seven. Do you read?
Roger, Texas Cap Com. Loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear. We have no queries down here. Continue with your observations please.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. Systems all operating normally. I gave my quantities again. There's no need to waste more time on those. I am pitching down to about 60° to make observation. Over.
Roger, we confirm down here on the TM. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. Just passed over El Paso in good shape. Could see town through some of the clouds, Over.
Friendship Seven, flying over complete cloud deck at present time.
I'm pitching down to 60° at present time. Orbit attitude in roll and yaw.
This is. ...
Canaveral Com Tech. How do you copy? Over.
Hello, Canaveral Com Tech. Friendship Seven. Loud and clear; how me?
Roger, Friendship Seven. This is Canaveral Com Tech. Copy you loud and clear, also. Standby for Cap Com please.
Roger.
Hello, Cap Com. Friendship Seven. Fuel is 62-60 [percent]; oxygen is 62-95 [percent]; amps 23. Over.
Friendship Seven, reading you loud and clear. I'll give you the 3 Bravo Time, 03 22 26. Over.
Roger, 03 22 26, for 3 Bravo. Is that affirm?
... 3 Charlie 03 40 18. Over.
Roger, 03 40 18 for 3 Charlie.
That is correct. At this time change your retro setting manually to 04 32 38. Over.
Roger, 04 plus 32 plus 38.
Roger, retrograde time is reset to 04 plus 32 plus 38. Over.
Roger, Seven. We recommend for the third orbit that you use gyros as you desire either normal or free so that in the event prior to retrofire on the third orbit that the scanners and ASCS|ASCS do not program properly you may use your gyros in the free position for attitude reference. Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. I have a fair, pretty good line-up now on the gyros, I believe. The check that I made on the night side was okay but they drifted off again, apparently rather rapidly in fact. I got another check on it and they seem to have corrected back pretty good now. I did not have to cage them again. Over.
Roger, Seven, we understand. The only problem is that you may not have enough light time prior yo retrofire.
Roger.
Let the gyros work in the free position if you desire. Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven.
Also, Seven, we recommend that you allow the capsule to drift on manual control in order to conserve fuel. Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven.
Seven, this is Cape. Standby for Z Cal.
Roger.
R Cal.
Cal off.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, this Bermuda Cap Com. We read you loud and clear.
Roger, Bermuda. Hear you loud and clear also.
Seven, this is Cape. Over.
Go ahead, Cape.
Correct your 3 Bravo time to 03 22 22. Over.
Roger, 03 22 22 for 3 Bravo.
Well, Seven, I'm having trouble, the seconds should be 32. Over.
Roger, 03 22 32.
Good Show.
Roger. Roger.
Hello Bermuda. Friendship Seven. It's over to you. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. We have nothing for you, you're in good shape.
Roger, this is Friendship Seven. I have the Cape in sight down there. It looks real fine from up here.
Rog. Rog.
As you know.
Yea, verily, Sonny.
This is Friendship Seven, Flor-, I can see the whole state of Florida just laid out like on a map. Beautiful.
Very good.
Even from this position out here, I can still see clear back to the Mississippi Delta.
This is Friendship Seven, checking down in Area Hotel on the weather and it looks good down that way. Looks like we'll have no problem on recovery.
Very good. We'll see you in Grand Turk.
Yes, Sir.
In fact, I can see clear down, see all the islands clear down that whole chain from up here, ... I can see way beyond them and area Hotel looks excellent for recovery.
Friendship Seven, Bermuda Cap Com.
Go ahead, Bermuda.
Cape recommends that you reenter on ASCS|ASCS with manual for backup.
Roger, this is Friendship Seven. Understand recommend ASCS|ASCS with manual backup.
This, this operation of ASCS|ASCS has been very erratic. I have not been able to pin it down to any particular, one particular item. It went off one direction in yaw at one time; it went off the other the next time. I felt for a little while that pitch was drifting. It seemed to have a little stuck thrust in pitch at one time and I have to keep correcting that and that corrected itself and then I was off in roll just after I came off the dark side this time. Over.
Roger, understand. I have all that down. Could you give us a blood pressure please?
Roger. Standby.
Friendship Seven, can you give me both your primary and secondary oxygen?
Roger, primary oxygen is 62 [percent], secondary is 94 [percent].
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven. I'm letting it drift a little bit to the right here to look up north.
Friendship Seven, Bermuda Cap Com.
Go ahead Bermuda.
Your fans inverter temperature is 205 [degrees] and your ASCS|ASCS temperature is 195 [degrees].
Roger, sounds real good, Gus, fine.
You're in good shape.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, you want to go to HF now?
Roger, Friendship Seven. Going to HF.
Friendship Seven, Bermuda Cap Com. How do you read on HF?
Bermuda, Friendship Seven. Loud and clear; how me?
You're weak but readable, John.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, Bermuda we have lost TM contact.
Roger, understand LOS.
This is Friendship Seven. I've drifted around almost to the 180° point again.
Friendship Seven, Bermuda Cap Com. Are you still in contact?
Roger, this is Friendship Seven. I'm around at the 180 [degree] point. I'm facing the direction I'm traveling, Gus. Do you still receive? Over.
Friendship Seven, Bermuda Cap Com. We do not read you.
Roger, Bermuda.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is CYI|CYI Com Tech, CYI|CYI Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Canary Com Tech. On HF; how do you receive me? Loud and clear from you. Over.
Friendship Seven, this is CYI|CYI Com Tech. Do you read? Over.

Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Canary Cap Com. I read you loud and clear.
Roger, Canary. Loud and clear here also.
Would you give me a brief station report? Over.
This is Friendship Seven. Fuel is 62-54. [percent]. Oxygen is 62-94, [percent], amps 24. Over.
Understand that auto fuel is 63 [percent] and manual fuel is 94 [percent]. Over.
Negative. Manual fuel is 54 [percent], 54 [percent]. Over.
54 [percent]. Over.
Canary, did you get manual fuel at 54 [percent] fiver four? Over.
Roger. Manual fuel at 54 [percent].
Friendship Seven, this is Canary Cap Com. How do you feel?
This is Friendship Seven. I feel fine; no effects whatsoever, none.
Friendship Seven. Are you still seeing the particles around your capsule?
Negative. I don't seem to see them around here on this side. I saw a few, just a few just after I left Canaveral and turned around facing forward. They were coming toward me at that time. I was going, so I know that they were not coming from the capsule at all. I saw the particles in huge quantities at each sunrise so far. Over.
Say again, Friendship Seven.
The particles I saw were mainly at sunrise each time around. Over.
I understand. What control mode are you on?
This is Friendship Seven. I am in manual. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Friendship Seven, this is Canary Cap Com. The Aeromed wants to talk to you. Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Aeromed.
This is Canary surgeon. Are you having any nausea, or have you experienced any nausea at all during the entire flight?
This is Friendship Seven. Negative. I have felt perfectly normal during the whole flight. I feel fine. Over.
Very good. Back to Cap Com.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, do you want your inverter temperatures at this time?
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. Go ahead.
Roger. We're turning you over to Canary Systems.
Friendship Seven, this is Canary Systems. How do you read?
Go ahead, Canary Systems, go ahead.
The systems on the ground look fairly normal at this time. The temperatures are a little bit on the high side but there's nothing critical showing up. The latest reports show that the inverters are about 200 [degrees] and 210 [degrees]; this does not seem to be critical. They should be holding all this level. Do you understand?
Roger. Friendship Seven.
All other systems are as you reported to me.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Atlantic Ship Cap, Com Tech. How do you read? Over.
Hello, Atlantic Cap Com. Read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Atlantic Ship Com Tech. We read you weak but broken, weak but broken.

Atlantic Ship, this is Friendship Seven. Over.
Hello, Atlantic Ship. Friendship Seven. Over.
Friendship Seven, this is ATS Cap Com. Read only the last part of your transmission. Say again, please.
Atlantic Ship, This is Friendship Seven. Wish you would pass to Cape. I let the capsule drift around to the 180° position and I am having to reorient at present time. When Iain all lined with the horizon and the periscope, my attitude indications now are way off. My roll indicates 30° right; my yaw indicates 35 [degrees] right; and pitch indicates plus 40 [degrees]; I repeat plus 40 [degrees] when I am in orbit attitude. Over.
Did you receive?
Roger, Friendship Seven. I read you a little broken. You have discrepancies in attitudes of 30° right in roll, 35 [degrees] right in yaw and plus 40 [degrees] in pitch. Confirm, please. Over.
That is affirmative. I am realigning the capsule at present time and wilt cage and uncage the gyros before I go on the dark side. Over.

Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Zanzibar Com Tech, transmitting on HF UHF. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Zanzibar Com Tech. Zanzibar Com Tech, Friendship Seven. Receive you weak but readable. How me? Over.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Zanzibar Com Tech transmitting HF UHF. You're weak and garbled, weak and garbled. Do not copy. Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven. I receive you rather garbled, also. My condition is good. Fuel 5, correction, fuel 64-48 [percent]; oxygen 52-92 [percent]. Over.
(ATS) Friendship Seven, this is ATS Cap Com. I'm reading you very clear, very clear. Could you give me the reason for the errors in your attitudes, please?
This is Friendship Seven. That's a good question. I wish I knew, too. These errors have been off and on all during the flight. I have caged and recaged the gyros, caged and uncaged the gyros. I'm back in orbit attitude now but it is not, the attitude indicators are showing orbit attitude but it's not. By looking out at the horizon, I am about 20° right in roll and 20° too much on pitch down. I'm down to about probably 55° down in pitch by visual observation and about 20° right in roll. Yaw appears to be holding okay now. Over.

This is Friendship Seven, approaching sunset.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Zanzibar Com Tech transmitting on HF UHF. Please acknowledge on HF. Over.
This is Friendship Seven recording. A lot of dirt on the windows from the retrofire and lot of stuff on here looks like, ah, we might have smashed some bugs even on the way up off the pad. Looks like blood on the outside of the window, maybe. It makes it real, very difficult to observe anything when they get around on the sun side.
Friendship Seven. The sun is going down again now. Coming off automatic in yaw, and yawing a little bit to the left to observe it.
Mark, the sun is down.
And can see little or nothing of zodiacal light at the moment.
This is Friendship Seven, flying with yaw handle pulled. Controlling on manual yaw.
The way the horizon looks is a very orange band. Just as the sun goes down and extends way off either side, probably 45° each side of the sun, comes up into a lighter yellow, then a very deep blue, then a very light blue, on up to the black of the sky.
Once again I can see lightning flashing under me, very clearly.

Hello, Zanzibar Com Tech. Friendship Seven on HF. Do you receive me now. Over.
Friendship Seven, this is Zanzibar Cap Com reading you weak but garbled.
Roger. Understand reading me weak and garbled.
This is Friendship Seven. I took the capsule off of automatic in yaw only to go left to look at the sunset. It's back on automatic at present time in all three axes; I'm backing it up with manual. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven, understand you're in automatic control in all three axes, backing up with manual. Is this affirmative. Over.
That is affirmative.
There's quite a big storm area under me. It must extend for, I see lightning flashes, as far, way off on the horizon to the right. I also have them almost directly under me here. They show up very brilliantly here on the dark side at night. They're just like firecrackers going off. Over.
Zanzibar, this is Friendship Seven. Did you get my fuels when I reported them? Over.
Repeat your last transmission. Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. Fuel is 60-55 [percent], oxygen is 60-92 [percent], Amps are 22. Over.
This is Friendship Seven. All voltages are 25, or above. Over.
This is Friendship Seven at 3 plus 42. We should be just about over Johannesburg, I cannot see anything of southern Africa on this pass. Over.
Zanzibar Cap Com. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Zanzibar. I'm reading you weak but readable.
Zanzibar Cap Com, Friendship Seven on HF. Can see long streaky clouds down below as we, going off to my right up into sort of a general weather pattern. That's 3 plus 44.
This is Friendship Seven. An observation on control system operation: It appears that whenever I go off on manual, or fly-by-wire and maneuver for any lengthy period of time, that somehow we induce considerably, considerable errors into the gyro system. I come up with all kinds of attitudes. That time for instance, when I yawed around 180°, and held for a little while, and came back again, I had errors of 30° in roll, 35 [degrees] in yaw and plus 40 [degrees] in pitch.
This is Friendship Seven, going on manual pitch.
This is Friendship Seven. Several times I have felt that I had a partially stuck thruster or one that was just partly operating in pitch down and just then again I had a pitch up rate going and all at once I felt a down thrust and it pitched down on me. Again there, it repeated again that time, so I think I have a stuck pitch thruster occasionally.

Friendship Seven, this is Indian Cap Com. Surgeon would like to talk to you. Over.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven.
This is the surgeon here. Have you switched to secondary oxygen for any reason during this hop? Over.
Negative. I don't quite understand the decrease in secondary either unless it's the bottles are beginning to cool down, but they shouldn't cool that much.
We're reading 90 [percent] on the TM. How about you?
I am reading 90 [percent] also.
Somewhere about 65 [percent]. This is Indian Surgeon. Out.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. This thing is slipping in and out of orientation mode and wasting fuel at present time. I'm just going to try and hold it on orbit attitude manually. Over. Or on fly-by-wire. Over.
Roger. Manually by fly-by-wire. Over.

Roger, Muchea. Loud and clear, how me? Over.
Hello, Muchea, Friendship Seven. Loud and clear, how me? Over.
Muchea Cap Com. Give us 30-minute report.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven. 30-minute report: ASCS|ASCS is major item, still not operating properly. I am on fly-by-wire at present time. I have no low thrust to the right fly-by-wire. Over.
Roger, understand no low right thruster on fly-by-wire.
That is affirmative. Got it?
We would like to send you a Z and R Cal sometime during your 30-minute report. ...
Roger. Fine.
You want to start down the 30-minute report there?
This is Friendship Seven. In 45 more seconds I would like to have you send a message for me, please. Over.
I want you to send a message to the Director, to the Commandant, U.S. Marine Corps, Washington. Tell him I have my 4 hours required flight time in for the month and request flight chit be established for me. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Think they'll pay it?
I don't know. Gonna find out.
Roger. Is this flying time or rocket time?
Lighter than air, buddy.
Rog.
We're sending you a Z and R Cal, hear.
Very well.
Coming now.
Are you going to start down on this procedure, or this 30-minute stuff?
Yes, all the fuse switches are still in the same position, Gordo. I haven't changed any of those. Squib is armed, Auto Retrojettison is off. I am on fly-by-wire, auto, and gyro normal. All "T" handles are in. The sequence panel is normal except for Landing Bag in the off position. The attitude indicator has been rather erratic, they drift very rapidly sometimes. Especially when I maneuver myself and then come back onto ASCS|ASCS. It seems they have been thrown way off at that time.
Roger.
My retrograde time 04 plus 32 plus 38 for capsule time which corrects for I second error in this clock.
On that, MCC|MCC recommends you change that to 04 32 37 shortly after you get done with these others.
Roger. Okay, cabin pressure is still holding at 5.5. It's been there ever since we left. 90 [percent] on cabin temp, relative humidity is back up again now to about 36 [percent], coolant quantity is down a little bit too, we may have had a small water leak some place since we have that much increase in humidity, cause it was down around 20 [percent]. Our coolant quantity, though, is down around 62 [percent] now. The suit temperature is 70 [degrees] inlet; cabin suit pressure is 5.8. Steam temperature is 4 point, is 48 [degrees]. Oxygen is 60-90 [percent]. Amps are 24, ASCS|ASCS is 11, about 115 now. Fan, is 110. Over.
Roger. All your switches outboard?
That's affirmative. On the right side, everything is outboard except the fuel quantity warning light which is on. I have that switch inboard to cut the audio.
The only 2 switch fuses in the center off position, on the right, are Retro Jettison and Retro Manual. Over.
Roger. Comfort control settings?
Control settings on the water?
Rog.
Water on, on cabin temperature is setting number 2. Setting on the suit temp is beyond the 1.7 mark. I repeat, beyond the 1.7 mark which is the maximum setting.
Roger. I understand. What is your opinion on the gyro problem, John?
Well, I don't know. I want to start lining up just as carefully as I can here in a minute and see whether the scanners will pick it up and correct it in so that we have a good retrofire attitude. If it is not, I'll aline it myself. Over.
Roger. Do you have your three Dog, Easy, and Hotel times from Indian Ocean Ship?
Yes I did. I got these okay.
And, now I gave you the recommended change in the retro clock to 04 32 37. On your retro, using ASCS|ASCS, you'll be using high torque thrusters for retrofire mode there. What do you say about retroing by ASCS|ASCS and backing up by fly-by-wire?
Well-well, you can't, you couldn't do it on ASCS|ASCS and fly-by-wire. You mean on manual.
No, I meant you could go ASCS|ASCS by fly-by-wire and back it up on manual proportional.
Yes. If the ASCS|ASCS appears to be programing and holding a good orbit attitude I'll let it go on ASCS|ASCS and back it up with manual. If not, if it appears that the gyros are cocked as they were a little while ago, then I'll just stay on manual retrofire, I think and let it go at that.
Are you in manual proportional or fly-by-wire now?
I'm in fly-by-wire now.
This is Friendship Seven. I am going to as near orbit attitude as I can establish here on the dark side.
Friendship Seven, Woomera Cap Com. We have contact UHF and TM solid.

This is Friendship Seven. Turning more water on on that one, see if I can cool it down a little more.
This is Friendship Seven. I can notice a little crackling on fly-by-wire switches when I operate fly-by-wire; it comes in on the head set.
This is Friendship Seven. Turned around, yawed 180 [degrees] to see the sunrise here, and also to see these little, these little gadgets here that I don't know what they are.
They do not seem to be coming from the capsule at all. There are too many of them. They're all spread out all over the place; it looks like they're some of them might be miles away.

Canton Cap Com, standby I'll give you a report in a minute here. I'm maneuvering back into retro attitude.
OK. Standing by.
Friendship Seven, this is Canton Cap Com. We are not receiving your transmissions and we have not lost your contact. Over.
Roger, Canton. I was busy maneuvering here. I did not give you your report yet, was getting lights set up and trying to stow everything for retro fire. I have 45-45 [percent] on fuel, oxygen is 60-90 [percent], amps is 23. My retrograde time is still set at 04 plus 32 plus 38. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven. Canton standing by.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven, Canton. I am getting in in orbit attitude so I can cage and uncage the gyros again. They're off again. Over.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Request you notify Cape.
Friendship Seven, this Cap Com. I did not read your last transmission. Would you repeat please?
Roger, Canton. Please notify Cape that I am indicating a roll 10° right, yaw 10° right, and pitch a plus 15 [degrees] when I'm in orbit attitude on the window and the scope. Over.

Roger. Going UHF.
Friendship Seven, do you read on UHF? Over.
Roger, read UHF loud and clear.
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. Reading you loud and clear on UHF.
Friendship Seven, we have been reading an indication on the ground of segment 51, which is Landing Bag Deploy. We suspect this is a erroneous signal. However, Cape would like, you to check this by putting the Landing Bag switch in auto position, and see if you get a light. Do you concur with this? Over.
Okay. If that's what they recommend, we'll go ahead and try it. Are you ready for it now?
Yes, when you're ready.
Roger. Negative, in automatic position did not get a light and I'm back in off position now. Over.
Roger, that's fine. In this case, we'll go ahead, and the reentry sequence will be normal.
Roger, reentry sequence will be normal.
Friendship Seven, have you completed your pre-retro check list?
This is Friendship Seven. Going to pre-re, check list at present time.
Roger. I'll standby.
Friendship Seven, Hawaii Cap Com.
Go ahead, Hawaii.
Have you completed pre-retro check list at this time?
That's affirmative. I'm just now completing it.
Roger. Can you comment again on this, the attitude system with respect to the, respect to the visual reference, how you feel about this at this time?
Well, it's into, it's in and out of orientation mode right now and is wasting fuel, in yaw. I may have to cut it in yaw, I don't know. It appears to be correcting, though, at the present time or maybe the scanners are correcting it okay now.
Roger, what mode are you in now?
I'm in ASCS|ASCS, automatic.
Understand.
Did you understand the Cape would like you to change your clock by one second, to 04 32 37?
Negative. I'll change it right now.
Okay. Time is now 04 32 and 37.
We confirm with TM readout.
Roger.
Everything looks good on the ground. The inverter temperatures are a little high; 225° on the 150, 212° on the 250. Everything else looks pretty good.
Roger.
Surgeon would like to know ff you're still comfortable.
Roger, I'm in very good shape. I'll go through exercise bit in just a minute here, as soon as I get done with check list.
Okay, going through light test. Okay, checks okay.
Okay, 5 minutes to retrograde, light is on.
Rog, 5 minutes to retrograde, light on.
TM is breaking up now. Friendship Seven, would you like a G.m.t. time hack?

Sure, they be.
Are they ever. It feels like I'm going back toward Hawaii.
Don't do that, you want to go to the East Coast.
Roger. Fire retro light is green.
All three here.
Roger.
Roger, retros have stopped. A hundred. ...
Keep your retro pack on until you pass Texas.
That's affirmative.
Check.
Pretty good looking flight from what all we've seen.
Roger, everything went pretty good except for all this ASCS|ASCS problem.
It looked like your attitude held pretty well. Did you have to back it up at all?
Oh, yes, quite a bit. Yeah, I had a lot of trouble with it.
Good enough for Government work from down here.
Yes, sir, it looks good, Wally. We'll see you back East.
Rog.
All right, boy.
Fire Retro is green.
Roger.
Jettison retro is red. I'm holding onto it.
Good head.
I'll tell you, there is no doubt about it when the retros fire.
Gathered that from your comments.
Everything is looking good, I'll give you a fast readout here. Fuel is 29-27 [percent]. The cabin pressure holding 5.5, cabin air is 88 [degrees], relative humidity is 33 [percent]; coolant quantity, 58 [percent], temperature is 71 [degrees], suit temperature is 71 [degrees], suit pressure is 5.8, steam temperature is 53 [degrees] in the suit, oxygen is, primary 60 [percent], 89 [percent] on secondary.
Looks pretty good on this end. How did the attitude seem to hold? Did you have any diversions in yaw at all?
Negative, very close. I backed it up and worked right along with the ASCS|ASCS and it looked like it held right on the money.
Roger, we didn't notice any particular disparity here.
Roger, good. Do you have a time for going to Jettison Retro? Over.
Texas will give you that message. Over.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven, cutting yaw on automatic and I'll control that manually; it keeps banging in and out of orientation.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
Hello, Texas. Friendship Seven. Over.
Friendship Seven, Cal Cap Com. Do you read?
Roger.
Consideration about leaving retropack on, they will inform you over Texas.
Roger
Roger, over the Coast.
Roger, clear blue here.
Yes, sir
This is Friendship Seven Can see El Centre and the Imperial Valley down there; Salton Sea very clear.
It should be pretty green; we've had a lot of rain down here
Yes, sir.
Do you notice any contrast over the coastline, John?
Say again.
How about contrast over the coastline?
Negative.
Roger.
There is quite a bit of cloud cover down in this area. I can, right on track, I can only see certain areas. I can see quite a bit on up to the north, however.
This is Friendship Seven, going to manual control.
Roger, Friendship Seven.
This is banging in and out here; I'll just control it manually.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, Guaymas Cap Com, reading you loud and clear.
Roger, Guaymas, read you loud and clear also.
Friendship Seven, Friendship Seven, this is Texas Com Tech. Do you read? Over
Roger, Texas, go ahead.
Roger. Reading you 5 square. Standby for Texas Cap Com.
Roger.
This is Texas Cap Com, Friendship Seven. We are recommending that you leave the retropackage on through the entire reentry. This means that you will have to override the 0.05g switch which is expected to occur at 04 43 53. This also means that you will have to manually retract the scope. Do you read?
This is Friendship Seven. What is the reason for this? Do you have any reason? Over.
Not at this time; this is the judgment of Cape Flight.
Roger. Say again your instructions please. Over.
We are recommending that the retropackage not, I say again, not be jettisoned. This means that you will have to override the 0.05g switch which is expected to occur at 04 43 53. This is approximately 4¼ minutes from now. This also means that you will have to retract the scope manually. Do you understand?
Roger, understand. I will have to make a manual 0.05g entry when it occurs, and bring the scope in manually. Is that affirm?
That is affirmative, Friendship Seven.
Roger.
This is Friendship Seven, going to reentry attitude, then, in that case.
Friendship Seven, Cape flight will give you the reasons for this action when you are in view.
Roger. Roger. Friendship Seven.
Everything down here on the ground looks okay.
Roger. This is Friendship Seven.
Confirm your attitudes.
Roger.
Friendship Seven, this is Cape. Over.
Go ahead, Cape. Friendship Seven.
Recommend you go to reentry attitude and retract the scope manually at this time.
Roger, retracting scope manually.
While you're doing that, we are not sure whether or not your landing bag has deployed. We feel it is possible to reenter with the retropackage on. We see no difficulty at this time in that type of reentry. Over.
Roger, understand.
Seven, this is Cape. Over.
Go ahead, Cape. Friendship Seven.
Estimating 0.05g at 04 44.
Roger.
You override 0.05g at that time.
Roger. Friendship Seven.
This is Friendship Seven. I'm on straight manual control at present time. This was, still kicking in and out of orientation mode, mainly in yaw following retorfire, so I am on straight manual now. I'll back it up. ...
... on reentry.
Say again.
Standby.
This is Friendship Seven. Going to fly-by-wire. I'm down to about 15 percent on manual.
Roger. You're going to use fly-by-wire for reentry and we recommend that you do the best you can to keep a zero angle during reentry. Over.
Roger. Friendship Seven.
This is Friendship Seven. I'm on fly-by-wire, back it up with manual. Over.
Roger, understand.
Seven, this is Cape. The weather in the recovery area is excellent, 3-foot waves, only one-tenth cloud coverage, 10 miles visibility.
Roger. Friendship Seven.
Seven, this is Cape. Over.

Okay, 25 amps and the power is good.
Roger. You're looking good.
Mark, 1 minute. Cabin pressure is on schedule; fuel and oxygen are steady, 24 amps; all the power is good.
Roger. Pitch is 56 [degrees]. You look--
Roger. My pitch looks good, it's smoothing down a little bit now. I feel the pitch program starting over.
Roger.
The sky is getting quite black at 01 30---elapsed. Fuel and oxygen is steady, cabin pressure is leveling off at 6.2 [psia], 22 amps and the power is still good, one cps sway in yaw.
Roger. Understand. Pitch is 37 [degree]. You look real good.
Stand by.
Roger. There is BECO on time, and--
Ah, Roger. Understand BECO.
Roger, I felt staging. Do you confirm?
Staging?
Do you confirm staging?
Aurora Seven, we confirm staging.
Roger, g peaked at 6.3.
The tower is way out. It's gone. The light is green. Going over the BECO check now.
Roger, Aurora Seven.
BECO check is complete
Roger. Understand complete. Is that correct?
That is. Roger.
At 3 minutes. Fuel and oxygen are still steady; cabin is holding 5.8 [psia]. Power still looks good; my status is good.
Roger. Pitch minus, minus 2 1/2 [degrees], and you're right on; you're good.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear, Gus.
Aurora Seven, . . ., you are good.
Roger. Still reading you. Broken a little bit. At 30, my status is good. Fuel and oxygen are steady. Cabin is holding 5.8 [psia]; Cabin is holding 5.8 [psia]. Power is good, 25 amps.

Roger, Aurora Seven. You're through 0.8, V over VR of 0.8.
Roger. 0.8.
Okay, there is SECO. The posigrades fired. I am weightless and starting the fly-by-wire turnaround. Aux Damp is good.
Roger. You look good down here.
Periscope is out, and . . . .
We have a Go, with a 7-orbit capability.
Roger. Sweet words.
Roger.
Okay, turnaround has stopped. I'm pitching down. I have the moon in the center of the window, and the booster off to the right slightly.
Roger. Understand.
Fly-by-wire is good in all axes; my pitch attitude is high; coming down now.
Roger. Understand.
Roger. The control system on fly-by-wire is very good. I have the booster in the center of the window now, tumbling very slowly.
Roger, Aurora Seven. Understand. You sound real good.
It's very quiet.
A steady stream of gas, white gas, out of the sustainer engine. Going to ASCS now.
Roger. Understand.
ASCS seems to be holding very well. I have a small island just below me.
Aurora Seven, standby for retrosequence times.
Standing by.
Area 1 B is 17 17.
17 17 Roger.
Roger, standby for later times. That's all I have right now.

Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com. Over.
Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com. Over.
Loud and clear, Gus. How me?
Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com. If you read, retro delay to normal?
Retro delay normal. Roger.
. . . igee 86 [nautical miles].
Roger. Copied perigee 86 [nautical miles]. Did not get apogee.
Mark. One picture of the booster. Going to transmit and record now. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . .  10, 11, 12 pictures of the booster, traveling right down the center of the booster, right down the center of the window.
Going over the insertion checklist now. D-c volts is main. Retromanual fuse switch is off. Retromanual is off. All instruments are. All batteries okay. The a-c power is good. The, let's see, where's the booster? There's some beautiful cloud patterns down there. The booster is in front of a large cloud pattern. I seem to be, I seem to be much closer to the earth than I expected to be. The booster is approximately 2 miles away now.
I have some pictures of the booster, maybe 17 or 18, all together. Then going to the horizon, north sweeping south. There is the moon, just setting. Winding the camera at this time.
There are some rather large pieces floating around. The flight plan is now out. Gyros are going to free at 12 33, and I'm going to fly-by-wire to track the booster. I will--this is not a good tracking problem. Our speeds are too close to being the same. I will put it in the center of the right window, plus. I have it right in the center--I feel that--overshot there. Getting ahead of me in pitch.
The high thrusters work well, close tracking should be done on--on fly-by-wire low only. To follow the booster is a tough job with the highs. Gyros are staying within limits pretty well. Elapsed time is 13 56. I have lost sight of the booster at this time. I'll pick up a retroattitude at this time for Canary radar. Large piece of--
Going back to gyros free, or to gyros normal.
Aurora Seven. This is Canary Cap Com. How do you read? Over.
Hello, Canary Cap Com. Aurora Seven. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
Read you loud and clear also. We have radar track. Please remain in orbit attitude.
Roger. Understand. I, my control mode is fly-by-wire, gyros normal, maneuver off. I am picking up retroattitude and automatic control very shortly. Over.
Roger. Will you verify that your retrodelay switch is in the normal position?
Retrodelay is normal. I say again, retrodelay is normal.
Roger. Will you please proceed with the short report, fuel and oxygen readings.
Roger. Fuel 103-100 [percent]. Oxygen 89-100 [percent]. All the power is good. Aurora seven status is Go in all respects. Over.
Roger. Say again fuel, please. Over.
Fuel 103-100 [percent]. Over.
Roger. Have copied.
Please send blood pressure. Over.
Roger. Blood pressure start now.
I have, west of your station, many whirls and vortices of cloud patterns. Pictures at this time--2, 3, 4, 5. Control mode is now automatic. I have the booster directly below me. I think my attitude is not in agreement with the instruments. It's probably because of that gyro free period. Outside of a minor difference in attitude indications, everything is proceeding normally.
Can you confirm orientation, ASCS and fly-by-wire . . . operating normal?
Roger. Wait one.
Roger. Canary, TS plus 5 is verified. Manual is satisfactory in all axes. Fly-by-wire and auto is satisfactory, all axes. Aux Damp is okay also. Over.
Roger. I have copied. I have new end of orbit, end of mission and 1 Bravo times for you. Are you prepared to copy?
Stand by one.
Send your message, Canary.
Roger. End of orbit time 01 28 17. End of mission, 04 32 27. 1 Bravo 16 plus 56. Did you copy? Over.
Roger. End of orbit 01 28 17, Hotel 04 32 39, 1 Bravo 16 56. Over.
Correction. Aurora Seven, correction 1 Bravo. Make that 16 plus 52. Over.

Roger. 143 and 86 [nautical miles].
Roger. Here are sunrise and sunset times. Sunrise orbit one: 1 plus 21 plus 00. Sunrise, orbit two: 2 plus 50 plus 00. Sunrise, orbit three: 4 plus 19 plus 00.
Roger, Canary. I'm going to have loss of signal before I get these. I want to get some pictures. Have Muchea, or, correction, have Kano send these to me in this order: Sunset, sunrise, sunset, sunrise, break, break. Did you copy?
-- plus 41 plus 20. Did you copy? Over.
That is negative. I'll have to wait awhile for those.
I'll get them from Kann. Thank you.
Have a blood-pressure reading. Your first attempt was unreadable on the ground. Over.
Okay. It's on the air.
Aurora Seven. This is Kano on UHF/HF. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Kano Cap Com. Aurora Seven reads you loud and clear. How me?
Roger, Aurora Seven. Kano Cap Com reads you loud and clear. Welcome back, Scott.
Roger.
Blood-pressure check, please. Hold your button for 4 seconds and then go through the short report.
Roger. Blood-pressure start, nob'. My status is good. The capsule status is good. Furl is 99-98 [percent]. Oxygen, 89-100 [percent]. Cabin is holding good. All d-c power is good. All a-c power is good, 22 amps. Everything is green and you should be reading blood pressure. Over.
Roger. We are reading blood pressure. Do you want to check your UHF low? Over.
Roger. Going to UHF low now, stand by 15.
Hello, Kano. Hello, Kano Cap Com. Aurora Seven UHF low. How do you read?
Aurora Seven. Kano Cap Com reads you loud and clear. Over.
Roger. Reading you the same. Going back to UHF high.
Aurora Seven, Kano Cap Com. How do you read? Over.
Loud and clear, Kano. Send your message.
Roger, Aurora Seven. Are you going to be doing your caging, uncaging procedure now? Over.
Roger. I--am a little behind in the flight plan at this moment. I have been unable at this time to install the MIT film. I finally have it. I'll go through the gyro uncaging procedure very shortly.
Roger.
Okay, the MIT film is now in.
ASCS is operating okay.
What mode are you on now?
Roger. My mode is auto, gyro normal, maneuver off.
Aurora Seven, Kano Cap Com. Be sure you're on fly-by-wire before going through the procedures for uncaging.
Roger. Roger. Understand.
I'm going to be unable to complete the MIT pictures on this pass, I believe. Negative, negative, I can fix the problem. Too much film was out of the canister, that was the problem. Film is now in tight. The small back going on now.
At 00 29 43, the first time I was able to get horizon pictures with MIT film. Set at F8 and 125th. A picture to the south into the sun, directly down my flight path is number two. Number three, 15 degrees north at capsule elapse 00 30 17.
Stowing the camera at this time. Going to the gyro uncaging procedure at this time. Fly-by-wire, now. Gyros going to cage. Maneuver at this point is on.
Pitching down, yawing left.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven. This is I.O.S. Com Tech on HF and UHF. How do you read? Over.
Roger, Indian Com Tech. Aurora Seven reading you weak but readable. Go ahead.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven. This is I.O.S. Com Tech on HF and UHF. How do you read? Over.
Hello, Indian Ship Cap Com. Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Hello, Indian Cap Com, Indian Cap Com, Aurora Seven. How do you read?
Hello, Indian Cap Com, Indian Cap Com, Aurora Seven. How do you read?
At 00 34 28, I'm increasing the cabin water valve and the suit valve to 6 [degrees]. Steam vent temperature now reads 65 and 75 [degrees].
Mark African coastal passage, about 20 seconds ago.
I'm using the airglow filter at this time. Visor is coming open for a better look at that. Hello, Indian Cap Com, Aurora Seven. Do you read?
Maneuver [switch] is going off at this time, and I'm going to aline manually to retroattitude.
Station calling Aurora Seven. Say again.
Okay. That took me some time to aline my attitudes properly. Three more pictures with MIT film: 2, 3, directly into the sun at an elapsed time of 00 39 42.
Okay, going through ...
The big back is going on the camera at this time. There was a period there when nothing was recorded because I was in VOX power off, instead of record. The big ...
At 00 43 02, I think my gyros are properly alined.
What in the world happened to the periscope?
Oh, its' dark, that's what happened. It's facing a dark earth. Sunset F16 to F, okay; we'll start with F16. Up north, coming south. Try some at 250.
It's getting darker. Let me see. Muchea contact, sometime. Oh, look at that sun.
F11.
F5.6 That was those last four, were F3.8. It's quite dark. I didn't begin to get time to dark-adapt.
Photo lights are off. Cabin lights are going to red at this time. Oh, man, a wide, a beautiful, beautiful red like in John's pictures. Going to fly-by-wire.
It is a reflection. It is a reflection in the window. That's too bad.
I see at this point; I'm not sure I am recording on VOX record. I will go to transmit. I have Venus, now approaching the horizon.
It's about 30 degrees up. It's just coming into view. Bright and unblinking. I cannot--I can see some other stars down below Venus. Going back to ASCS than at this time.
Bright, bright blue horizon band as the sun gets lower and lower--the horizon band still glows. It looks like five times the width of the--the diameter of the sun. I'm at--now at 00 47 34 elapsed.
It's now nearly dark, and I can't believe I'm where I am.
Oh, dear, I've used too much fuel.
Well, I'm going to have to increase. Let's see, going to ASCS at this time.
My fuel reads 75-100 [percent] at this time. The window--is Venus occlude. No, that--that is not correct. Venus did not occlude. I'm getting out the equipment to measure Venus occlusion.
There is too much red light in the cockpit from the time correlation. Venus at above the--horizon.
Aurora Seven. This is Muchea Cap Com. How do you read?
Hello, Muchea Cap Com, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me, Deke?
Rog. Coming in very good, dad. Sound very good. How's things going?
Roger. Things axe going very well. My status is very good. The capsule status is very good. The control mode is normal. Automatic gyros normal and maneuver off. Fuel is 72-100 [percent]. Oxygen 88-100 [percent]. Everything is normal with the exception of---the fact that I am a tad behind in the flight plan. Over.
Roger. Understand.
Blood pressure is starting now.
Okay. Blood pressure starting. We suggest that you do not exercise during the blood pressure since your temp is up.
Roger. This is the story on the suit temp. I have increased two 10-degree marks since lift-off. And now about--well, 15 degrees above launch mark. My steam vent temperatures read 69 and 80 [degrees]. I'll take one more stab at increasing or decreasing temperature by increasing flow rate. If this doesn't work, I'll turn them off and start lower. Over.
Rog, Understand. I'll give you some retrotimes while you're sending blood pressure. End of orbit is 01 28 18. End of mission is 04 32 28.
Roger. Understand. End of orbit 01 28 18 and 04 32 28 for end of orbit. Over. End of mission.
That's affirmative. We indicate your clock is 1 second slow and this is compensated for.
Roger. Thank you.
G.m.t. time hack at this time--we're coming up on 13 36 57. Mark.
Roger. My G.m.t.--my backup G.m.t. are right in synch, with G.m.t. Over.
That's very good.
Okay, if you're ready, I'll give you the emergency voice check. We will turn off UHF and HF transmitters for this so that you will not have to change volume.
Roger, standing by.
Aurora Seven. Muchea Cap Com. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 command voice. How do you read?
Roger, Deke. Read you loud and clear, loud and clear emergency voice.
Very good, Very good. Switching back to UHF.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Muchea Cap Com on UHF. How do you read?
Roger. Muchea Cap Com. Loud and clear. Tell Jerry and Gus and Lewis and--everybody else there, that I worked with "hello." John Whittler, if you see him, tell him to saddle Butch up. Break, break. Is your cloud cover such that I can expect [to] see light--or flares at Woomera? Over.
Roger. The cloud coverage here is 3,000 [nautical miles] overcast stratus, and we think you'll probably see them through the clouds. Woomera is clear.
Roger.
Seven from Muchea. Would you send us one more blood pressure?
Roger. Starting now.
We're going to send you a Z cal at this time.
Roger. And--go ahead and send it. I'll--you'll be interested to know that I have no moon, now. The horizon is clearly visible from my present position; that's at 00 54 44 elapsed. I believe the horizon on the dark side with no moon is very good for pitch and roll. The stars are adequate for yaw in, maybe 2 minutes of tracking. Over.
Roger, Understand. Sounds very good. Z cal off; R cal coming on. Mark.
Suggest that you back the fuel control back to your first black mark.
Roger. I'll try that. Going all the way off and back up a little bit lower than where I was.
Roger. Your suit temperature is down a bit at this point.
Say again, Deke.
Your suit temperature is down, which is good.
Well, that's a result of an increase in flow lately. I would think that--I'll try increasing rather than decreasing.
Hello, Woomera Cap Com, Aurora Seven. Do you read?
This is Muchea Cap Com. They will not be contacting you for another 3 minutes.
Roger. Go ahead, Deke. Just trying to get the word on the flare.
Roger. Understand. I'll give you the settings, correction, the attitudes for the first flare at this time. It would be plus 80 [degrees] yaw, minus 80 [degrees] in pitch.
Roger Understand, Deke. Plus 80 [degrees] yaw, minus 80 [degrees] pitch.
Roger. Okay. The Cape now advises to keep the suit setting where it was since it's coming down.
Roger. I--for your information, I have increased it just slightly. My readings now are 7 [psia] and 7 [psia] on suit and cabin. What are my inverter temperatures and thruster line temperatures, Deke? Are they okay?
Rog. We are losing you. We are losing you on air-ground. Would you care to contact Woomera at this time?
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Woomera. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Roger, Woomera. Reading you loud and clear, also. I'd like readout on my inverter temperatures--and mark on your flare. Over.
Roger. We're going to have the flare in approximately 2 minutes. We'll give you a readout on your temperatures.
Roger. And for your information, Rate Command is also working in all axes. Over.
Roger. Rate--rate Command in all axes.
That--that signifies that all control systems are operating satisfactorily. Over.
Roger. Understand. All systems okay. We have your temperatures. Your 150 inverter, 152 [degrees]. Your 250 inverter, 167 [degrees]. Do you copy? Over.
Roger. Copied, thank you. Standing by.
We're going to have the flares. All four of them go at approximately 00 [plus] 58 plus 30. We do have an eight by eight coverage.
Roger. I am at--plus 80 [degrees] yaw, minus 80 [degrees] pitch now.
Roger. We'll give you a time hack when we come up to flare test.
Roger.
This is Woomera Cap Com, Seven. Surgeon reports all systems look good down here. And Systems reports everything okay on his panel.
Roger. Thank you. It looks good to me, also.
Roger. You are loud and clear. Coming up on the flare test--in approximately 25 seconds.
Roger.
Good air-to-ground.
Roger. Going to fly-by-wire. It doesn't cost so much.
Roger. Fly-by-wire, Manual on. Is that affirmative?
Manual is--no, I'm, my control mode is pure fly-by-wire now.
Roger. Flare test coming up. Stand by. Mark 00 [plus] 58 plus 30. All four flares away.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Woomera. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear. Searching for your flares. Stand by.
Roger. We still have approximately 60 seconds left.
You're up to minus 50 [degrees] on roll.
Roger. Backing off. Thank you, thank you. Backing off.
I do not have your flares. I'm sorry, Woomera.
Say again, Seven.
No joy on your flares. I do not have your flares visible.
Have copied. Evidently the cloud coverage is too tight.
At this time I have extensive cloud coverage--wait.
Did you try Aux Damp when you're in fly-by-wire to see if you are holding attitudes?
Negative. I have verified that Aux Damp is operating satisfactorily. Over.
Roger. Understand.
I have some lights on the ground underneath me. Stand by, I'll try to identify them.
Roger. Wilco.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Woomera Cap Com. Do you read? Over.
Loud and clear, Woomera. Go ahead.
Roger. Could you give us a short report at this time?
Roger. My control mode is fly-by-wire, gyros are free, and the maneuver switch is off. Fuel reads 75-85 [percent], oxygen 88 and 100 [percent]. Wait till I pick a washer out of the air. And everything is very good. Over.
Roger. You're intermittent. What is your suit temperature? Over.
Roger. Suit temperature is now 70 [degrees]. Suit temperature is 70 [degrees]. Steam exhaust is 70 [degrees]. The cabin exhaust is 80 [degrees].
Roger. Do you confirm--do you have your--back down to the black scribe mark?
That is negative. I have then both set on seven at this time and--an increase in setting resulted in a decrease--in suit temperature. I think I'd like to try--try them at this setting a little while longer. Over.
Roger. Understand. I believe at this time you're supposed to have your midnight snack.
Roger. I'll get to that shortly.
Roger. You're starting to drift or fade slightly.
Roger.
Are you prepared to go into drifting flight before too long?
Roger. I can do that at this time. At night yawed--
. . . is that affirmative?
I am going to drifting flight at this time. Over.
Roger.
Gyros are caged. I have about a 2-degree-per-second yaw rate. All gyros are zero. I have Corvus directly above me. I'm yawing over the top. I feel that my attitude is--the line of sight is nearly--nearly vertical.
I am in VOX record only now. The time is 01 04 00 elapsed. I'm searching the star charts.
The finish on the star chart is so shiny that--it's impossible to read because of reflection.
I've got to turn white lights on, that's all.
At 01 05 00.
Attitudes are of no concern to me whatsoever. I know I'm drifting freely. The moon crossed the window not too long ago.
Let's see, now what can--I am at this moment rocking my arms back and forth and I can make this show up in the roll, yaw, and pitch needle. By moving my torso, I can make the pitch rate needle move up to 1 degree per second. Roll is, needle, rate needle is very sensitive to this. Yaw is also. Let's see, am going to open the visor at this time. Have a few crumbs of food floating around in the capsule.
At 01 06 106---at 1 minute, 1 hour and 7 minutes elapsed, I'm going above the scale to approximately 8 on cabin and suit.
Hello, hello, Canton Com Tech, Canton Com Tech, Aurora Seven. Weak but readable. Go ahead.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven. This is Canton Com Tech, Canton Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Canton Com Tech, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
The food--hello, Canton Com Tech, Aurora Seven. How do you read?
Hello, Canton Com Tech, Aurora Seven. How do you read?
This food has crumbled badly.
First meal at 01 08 52.
Hello, Canton Com Tech, Canton Com Tech, Aurora Seven on HF. How do you read?
Seven, this is Canton Com Tech. Do you read?
Canton Com Tech, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How do you read Aurora Seven on HF? Over.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven. This is Canton Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Canton Com Tech. Loud and clear. How me?
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven. This is Canton Com Tech. Do you read?
Hello, Canton Com Tech, Canton Com Tech, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
This is Canton. Loud and clear, Aurora Seven. Can you begin with the short report?
Roger. I've been reading you for some time. I've tried to contact you on HF with no success. My status is good; the capsule status is good; control mode is fly-by-wire; gyros caged; maneuver is off. The fuel reads 74-85 [percent]. Oxygen is 87-100 [percent]. The cabin temperature is a bit high at 104 [degrees]. The suit--steam vent temperature is 70 [degrees], and cabin is 80 [degrees], but I believe they're coming down. Over.
Roger. Did you wish to check your attitude readings with our telemetry? Over.
Roger. My--my gyros are caged at this time. Stand by one.
Standing by.
I am beginning to pick up what I believe is a--yeah, it's very definitely a cloud pattern equally low.
Roger.
I am--let's see, Canton, do you have the exact sunrise time for the first orbit? Over.
Say again, Aurora Seven.
Sunrise time for first orbit. Over.
I have a sunrise time of 1 plus 21 plus 00.
1 plus 21 00. Roger. Thank you.
Did you--could you comment on whether you are comfortable or not--would you . . .  a 102 [degrees] on body temperature.
No, I don't believe that's correct. My visor was open; it is now closed. I can't imagine I'm that hot. I'm quite comfortable, but sweating some.
Roger. Can you confirm then that the faceplate is closed, and will be closed for the pass over Guaymas.
That is correct, George. I'll leave the faceplate closed. I have had one piece of the inflight food. It's crumbling badly and I hate to get it all over, and I have had about four swallows of water at that time.
Roger, four swallows of water.
You wish to start your comment now on the haze layer--there was the . . . pitch, and at the same time confirm that the flight plan is on schedule.
Roger. I cannot confirm that the flight plan is completely on schedule. At sunset I was unable to see a separate haze layer--the same--height above the horizon that John reported. I'll watch closely at sunrise and see if I can pick it up. Over.
Roger.
All readings appear to be normal down here. The capsule looks good from down here.
Roger, the--
. . . queries, you can continue on with your observations. Over.
Roger. Thanks, George, see you next time around.
Okay, Scott. Good luck.
Aurora Seven, Hawaii Com Tech. How do you read me? Over.
I am in VOX record now. I heard Hawaii calling, ha ha, Hawaii calling. I will go to transmit directly, and see if we can pick up Hawaii.
Hello, Hawaii Com Tech, Aurora Seven on HF. Loud and clear. How me?
Hello, Hawaii Com Tech, Hawaii Com Tech, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How do you read HF? Over.
Going now to record only while I switch back to UHF.
Hello, Hawaii, hello, Hawaii Com Tech, Aurora Seven. Weak but readable. Go ahead.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, . . . on HF, UHF. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Hawaii Com Tech. Aurora Seven reading you loud and clear. How me?
Aurora Seven. Hawaii Com Tech. How do you read?
All right. My--I am at 01 19 02. Have been several times completely disoriented. There, I have Cassiopeia directly in the window and am yawing around for the sunrise--photographs. The sky is quite light in the east.
Excess cabin-water light came on at that time. I'll have to go back all the way down and off. Suit is--still high. The cabin-water gage is reading--plus 9, which is hard to believe.
My temperature, my body temperature doesn't feel . . . feel bad at all. My suit--yes, my suit temperature is down now, also.
But the steam vent temperature is--still about--70 [degrees].
I have the fireflies. Hello, Guaymas.
I have the particles. I was facing away from the sun at sunrise and I did not see the particles--just--just yawing about--180 degrees, I was able to pick up--at this.--Stand by, I think I see more.
Yes, there was one, random motions--some even appeared to be going ahead. There's one outside. Almost like a light snowflake particle caught in an eddy. They are not glowing with their own light at this time.
It could be frost from a thruster.
Going to transmit to--record only, at this time.
The weightless condition is a blessing, nothing more, nothing less.
I am now photographing large cloud banks over the Pacific on a southerly direction.
I'm drifting slowly to retroattitude at this time.
Hello, Guaymas Com Tech. Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Aurora Seven, this is Guaymas Cap Com. How me? Over.
Roger, Guaymas, loud and clear. My control mode is now fly-by-wire; gyros are caged, I'm in-- maneuver is off. I'll go to automatic mode directly. My status good; the capsule status is good. The fuel is 69-69 [percent], oxygen is 88-100 [percent]. The cabin steam vent has gone to plus 10, I believe that's a bad gage reading, and suit temperature steam vent is coming down slowly, now reading 68 [degrees]. Over.
Roger. Understand 68 [degrees]. How is your temperature comfort? Over.
Roger. My body comfort is good. I am tracking now a very small particle, one isolated particle, about--there is another, very small, could be a light snowflake.
Roger. We're reading--we're having a--a bad body temperature reading on you, 102.4 [degrees], probably erroneous.
I can't believe it. My suit temperature shows 60 [degrees] and I feel quite comfortable. I'm sure I would be sweating more than this if my temperature were 102 [degrees].
Your suit-inlet temperature, near 61 [degrees], so it looks pretty good.
Roger.
Roger. It looks like we have a go for the second orbit as everything appears all right for you.
Roger. I was hoping you'd say that, Gordo.
You start to conserve your fuel a bit and maybe, perhaps, use a little more of your manual fuel.
Roger. Can do.
Roger, are you ready for Z and R cal?
Roger, send them.
Z cal coming on now.
And, mark, coastal passage.
Say again.
Mark, coastal passage coming over the--Baja.
Good.
How does it look?
Half covered with clouds, and--and the other half is dry. Will you pass on--this message for me, Gordo, to all the troops at Guaymas?
Hola, amigos, felicitaciones a Mexico y especialmente a mi amigos de Guaymas. Desde el espacio exterior, su pais esta cubierto con numbes--and es--also--se muy bello. Aqui el tiempo esta muy bueno. Buena suerte desde Auror Siete.
Roger, muchas gracias, amigo.
Ha ha, okay.
Give us a blood pressure.
Here you go.
Roger, do you--I'd like to pass your 2 Alpha time on to you, Scotty.
Roger.
Roger, 2 Alpha time is 01 36 13, with a G.M.T. of 14 21 30. That takes into account your clock error.
That's 02 36 13?
Roger, 01 36 13.
Roger, 01 36 13 for 2 Alpha.
For Golf, 03 00 31.
Roger, 03 00 31 for Golf.
There's a G.m.t. on that of 15 45 48.
Roger. Standing by for the . . . my mark on the radar test over White Sands.
...
Roger.
Roger. Command roll now.
Roll now.
No, I'll have to get in a better attitude for you first, Gus. It'll mean nothing this way, I mean Coop.
Roger.
You still reading us, Scotty?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Hearing you also. Have you done your roll for the radar yet?
That's negative. I'm afraid I'm not going to make it, Gordo, unless I get the attitudes--down close.
Roger. We're reading your attitudes all right at zero now.
Roger. The gyros are caged.
Aurora Seven, this is Cape Cap Com on emergency voice.
Roger, Cape. Loud and clear. How me?
Loud and clear. I'm going back to HF/UHF.
Roger.
Are you ready for your 2 Bravo time?
Roger. Send 2 Bravo.
01 49 30.
Roger. 01 49 30.
Roger. And 2 Charlie time is nominal.
Okay. Stand by one.
Okay, Gus, my status is good; my control mode is fly-by-wire; the gyros are still caged; maneuver is off. Fuel is 62 and 68 [percent]. A little ahead on fuel consumption; fuel quantity light is on; the excess cabin-water light is on. I'll try and get auto mode here directly.
Roger. Can you give us a blood pressure?
Roger. Blood pressure coming now.
And after the IOS voice has dropped, will use Zanzibar in that area.
Roger. I heard IOS calling, but I couldn't raise him.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, use a normal balloon release.
Roger.
And are you going to give me a mark for that?
Roger. One at an elapsed time of 01 37.
01 37. Roger.
Roger. In 2 minutes, Echo will be almost directly overhead.
Roger.
Could you give us a cabin steam and suit temperature, please?
Roger. Suit steam is 69 [degrees] and cabin is plus 11. That dropped down very suddenly when the excess cabin-water light came on. I think I'm going to--increase . . . I'll try to increase suit-water flow one more time. If that doesn't work I'll drop--down--to closed and start over again.
Aurora Seven, cut back your cabin water.
Okay. Cabin water going back. I'll start now at two. This is 20 degrees below launch value.
Roger. I'm going to give you a Z cal.
Roger.
Okay. I'm going to give you an R cal.
Be my guest.
Aurora Seven, Cap Com. Do you read?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger. Everything looks good down here, except for your fuel usage; you better watch that a little bit.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, have you deployed the balloon?
That is negative. Stand by.
Balloon deploy, now. The balloon is out and off. I, I see it way out, but it--I think now it is way out, and drifting steadily away. I don't see the line. I don't see that any attempt was made to inflate the thing. It's just drifting off.
I have only the rectangular shape tumbling at this point about 200 yards back, barely visible; and now wait, here is a line. That was the cover, the balloon is out.
Understand. The balloon is out.
That is Roger.
There is very little acceleration here.
Aurora Seven, did the balloon inflate?
The balloon is partially inflated. It's not tight. I've lost it at this moment. Wait one, I'll give you a better reading shortly.
There is an oscillation beginning.
This is an oscillation in the balloon?
Yes.
The line is still not taut. I have some pictures of the line just waving out in back. I would say we have about a one-cycle-per-minute oscillation. It's both in pitch and yaw.
How many cycles per minute?
One cycle per minute, or maybe 1 cycle in a minute and a half.
The moon is just above the horizon at this time.
I have a picture of the balloon.
Aurora Seven, Cap Com. Repeat your last message.
Roger. I've got a washer to put away.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven. this is Bermuda Flight. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Bermuda Flight, reading you loud and clear.
Switch wobulator switch off.
Roger. Phase shifter.
Mark!
Phase shifter is off.
Phase shifter is on, now.
Aurora Seven, Cap Com. What control mode?
Fly-by-wire.
Thank you.
Bermuda Flight. How do you read?
Hello, Bermuda Flight. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
Will you run a blood pressure, please? Read you loud and clear.
Roger. Blood pressure starting now.
I have lost sight of the balloon at this minute.
Roger.
Also, Bermuda, the balloon not only oscillates in cones in pitch and yaw, it also seems to oscillate in and out toward the capsule; and sometimes the line will be taut, other times it's quite loose.
It's now about 50 degrees off of the flight path.
Pictures of whirls taken, just east of Bermuda, now the balloon line is tight.
At 01 45 30, I have turned the cabin, or the suit-water valve all the way off and back up to one.
I'm taping now the fuel quantity warning lights in preparation for the dark side. I think also excess cabin water I'll tape. It's not a satisfactory lighting arrangement to ...
Hello, Canary Cap Com. Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Canary Cap Com. How do you read? Over.
Hello, Canary Cap Com. Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. You're coming into UHF range. Proceed with the short report. Over.
Roger, Canary. My status is good; the capsule status is good; my control mode is automatic; gyros normal; maneuver off. Fuel 51-68 [percent], oxygen 85-100 [percent]; my cabin steam vent temperature now is picking up and reading about 19, suit steam vent temperature still reading 70 [degrees]. I have backed it off to zero and reset it at one. Over.
. . . cabin exhaust temperature. Over.
Cabin exhaust temperature is climbing back up to 19. Over.
Roger. Have you been doing any drifting flight? Over.
That is Roger. I did quite a bit of drifting flight on the dark side over Woomera and Canton. Over.
Roger. Did you observe any haze layers? Over.
Roger, I did observe haze layers but not the ones that were separated from the horizon that we expected, and that John reported. I'll keep a sharp lookout next time and try to see them after sunset. On the light side there is nothing more than the bright, iridescent blue layer, which separates the actual horizon from the deep black of space. Over.
Aurora Seven, you are fading rapidly. You are fading. MCC [Mercury Control Center] is worried about your auto fuel and manual fuel consumption. They recommend that you try to conserve your fuel.
Roger. Tell them I am concerned also. I will try and conserve fuel.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, I cannot read you. Do you read Canary Cap Com? Over.
Roger. Canary, copied your message. Over.
Roger. Understand copied message regarding fuel and consumption.
That is Roger.
Surgeon here has requested a blood-pressure transmission.
Blood pressure is coming your way now.
We are receiving same at Canaries and it looks good.
Roger.
Canary Systems indicates all telemetry readings look good.
Roger. That's good to hear.
Aurora Seven, do you have anything to report on your balloon test? Over.
Roger. The balloon is oscillating through an arc of about 100 degrees. It gets out of view frequently. At this moment, it's nearly vertical. Mark a coastal passage at this time--it seems to--what I'm trying to tell you is that it oscillates 180 degrees, above and below. Over.
It also oscillates in and out. Sometimes the line is tight and other times it is not.
When I look over to the right side, I have the sensation that--
Hello.
This is Kano. How do you read? Over.
Hello, Kano. Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Kano. How do you read? Over.
Hello Kano. Loud and clear. How me?
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Kano. How do you read? Over.
Kano, this is Aurora Seven. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
Aurora Seven, Kano Cap Com. What is your status? Over.
Roger. My status is good; fuel reads 51 [percent] and--and 69 [percent]; oxygen is 84 [percent] and 100 [percent]; cabin pressure is holding good. All d-c and a-c power is good. The only thing of--to report regarding the flight plan is that fuel levels are lower than expected. My control mode now is ASCS. I expended my extra fuel in trying to orient after the night side. I think this is due to conflicting requirements of the flight plan. I should have taken time to orient and then work with other items. I think that by remaining in automatic, I can keep--stop this excessive fuel consumption. And the balloon is sometimes visible and sometimes not visible. I haven't any idea where it is now, and there doesn't seem to--and it seems to wander with abandon back and forth, and that's all, Kano.
Roger, Aurora Seven. Will you give us a blood-pressure check again--. Over.
Roger. Blood pressure is on the air.
Aurora Seven, how are you feeling? Your body temperature is up somewhat. How do you feel? Over.
Roger. I feel fine. Last time around I--someone told me it was 102 [degrees]. I don't feel, you know, like I'm that hot. Cabin temperature is 101 [degrees]. I'm reading 101 [degrees], and the suit temperature indicates 74 [degrees].
Are you perspiring any?
Slightly, on my forehead.
Since turning down the suit water valve, the suit steam vent temperature has climbed slightly--am increasing from one to two at this time. This should bring it down. The cabin steam vent temperature has built back up to 40 [degrees].
Roger, Aurora Seven, everything looks okay now. We seem to have lost the body temperature readings from previous stations. We are reading 102 [degrees] right now, but as long as you feel okay right now.
Roger, I feel fine.
Can you see anything of the Gulf of Guinea?
Roger. I just--just passed the coastline, and I am over a solid cloud cover at this time
Roger, Aurora Seven. Would you care to send a greeting to the people of Nigeria?
Roger, please send my greetings and best wishes of me and my countrymen to all Africans. Over.
Roger. Thank you very much. I'm sure it will be appreciated. Over.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Kano. Are we still in contact? Over.
Say again, Kano.
Roger. Would you repeat in a few words why you thought the fuel usage was great? Over.
I expended it on--by manual and fly-by-wire thruster operation on the dark side, and just approaching sunrise. I think that I can cut down the fuel consumption considerably on the second and third orbits. Over.
Roger. Understand. Over.
Have you started your night adaptation? Over.
Roger
Aurora Seven, Kano. Just for your own information, the 250 inverter is on 180 degrees right now. Over.
Say again, please.
... Over.
At this time, oh-oh, this doggone food bag is a problem.
Actually, the food bag is not a problem, the food inside it is. It's crumbled. I dare not open the bag for fear the crumbs will get all through the capsule.
Things are very quiet.
Roger: Zanzibar. Loud and clear. How do you read Aurora Seven?
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Zanzibar Com Tech, transmitting on HF/UHF. Do you copy? Over.
Roger. Loud and clear. How me, Zanzibar?
Auroral Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Zanzibar Cap Com. Read you weak, but readable. Do you have a short report for us?
Roger. My status is good; the capsule status is good; my control mode is automatic; gyros are normal; maneuver is off. Control fuel is 51 [percent] and 69 [percent]; oxygen is 82 [percent] and 100 [percent]. That's about all except I have, so far, been unable to get my suit steam vent temperature down much below 70 [degrees]. Steam vent, or the water control valve, setting at this time is 4 at the prelaunch mark. It may be too high. Turning it off at this time and going to three, which is where the cabin is set. Over.
Aurora Seven, Zanzibar Cap Com. Roger, Roger. Do you have the latest--contingency area times?
Roger: I have them.
Very good. Are you going to start your balloon test?
The balloon is out. I don't see any reason for not leaving it on through the dark side, and I just saw a particle going by at about 2 or 3 feet per second.
Roger, understand. According to flight plan, you're supposed to go to FBW about now, and he says you're on auto mode and I wondered if you plan to go through with this. Over.
That is negative. I think that the fact that I'm low on fuel dictates that I stay on auto as long as the fuel consumption on automatic is not excessive. Over.
Roger, Aurora Seven. Congratulations on your trip so far and I'm glad everything has gone ...
Thank you very much.
I now have the wide, blue horizon band. It looks to be, at this time Capsule elapsed 02 0700, to be about the diameter underneath the sun. It seems to be the same thickness underneath the sun as the sun's diameter. North and south it becomes less distinct and lighter. It extends up farther from the horizon.
Roger, Aurora Seven. That's a hard one to pronounce, anything that we can do for you ...
Negative. I think everything is going quite well.
Roger, We'll be waiting. Out.
Roger. See you next time.
Aurora Seven, this is Indian Ocean Ship. Over.
Roger, Indian Cap Com. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Loud and clear. We have had transmitter trouble on your previous run. We just got a message from the Cape . . . to conserve fuel. I monitored part of your transmission to Zanzibar and understand . . . the situation.
That is Roger.
Do you have retrosequence times for 2 Delta, 2 Echo and Golf?
That is negative. I have the nominals.
Roger. 2 Delta and 2 Echo are still nominal. Area Golf is 03 00 29, 03 00 29.
Roger. 03 00 29.
Roger, Aurora Seven, I read you loud and clear. Do you have any comments for the . . . Ocean?
That is Roger. I believe we may have some automatic mode difficulty. Let me cheek fly-by-wire a minute.
All thrusters are okay.
Roger.
However, the gyros do not seem to be indicating properly.
Roger.
And that is not correct either. The gyros are . . . are okay; but on ASCS standby. It may be an orientation problem. I'll orient visually and . . . see if that will help out the ASCS problem.
Aurora Seven from Indian Cap Com. Your blood pressure on your . . . fairly high and you are supposed to, if possible, give a blood pressure over Indian Ocean Ship.
Roger. I've put blood pressure up on the air already. Over.
Say again, Aurora.
Blood pressure is on the air now.
Roger.
Blood pressure is coming through fine.
Your blood pressure is coming through fine.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, this is Indian Cap Com. We have lost telemetry contact. How do you read me? Over.
Roger. Still reading you okay.
. . . report to Cape you have checked fly-by-wire and all thrusters are okay. Is there anything else?
That is negative. Except this problem with steam vent temperature. I'm going--I'll open the visor a minute; that'll cool--it seems cooler with the visor open.
Roger. Did you take xylose?
That is negative. I will do so now.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, confirm you've checked fly-by-wire and all thrusters okay.
Roger. Fly-by-wire is checked; all thrusters are okay.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Indian Ocean Cap Com. I do not read your transmission.
Roger. Indian Cap Com, Aurora Seven.
Out.
Well, I have--I am in record only, and I am getting warm now.
Don't know what to with the cabin.
I'll turn it up and see what happens.
I have gotten badly behind in the flight plan now.
Okay, evaluating capsule stability at this time. The capsule is most stable.
I seem able to put it at zero rates. All right, I will do that now. At capsule elapsed 02 17 32, I will zero out all rates.
That's as close to zero as I can make it. At 02 17 49, my rates are zero and attitudes are zero plus, or at zero, minus 3, minus 48. Let those rest awhile, and I'll see what we can do about suit temperature.
Cabin is rising. Suit temperature seems to be rising too. I'm going to let it go out until 02 25 00 to see if this is going to bring it down some.
I don't need to exercise. I really don't feel I need the exercise. I would get too warm.
We'll be getting to Muchea shortly.
Have a slight pitch up rate at this time, at 02 19 13. I'll zero that out, now. Fly-by-wire--have a slight yaw left rate--I'll zero out now. Attitudes at this time are minus 30.
Both busses are okay. All--let's see--number two battery is down to 22. One, is 24; three, is 24; standby one and two, are 24; isolated, is 27; main, is 23; main IBU, is 27. Two--two is now up. Main battery number two is up.
I am over the dark side now. The moonrise has not occurred and although I still see the lighted area from the setting sun behind us.
Now, I do have the haze layer at this time. It seems to be brighter than--it's good to open the cabin, open the visor.
The reticle now extincts at about 5.6.
Hello, Muchea Cap Com. Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Read you loud and clear also. What's your status?
Roger. My status is good; control mode is fly-by-wire; gyros normal; maneuver off. Fuel is 45-6-70 [percent], that's 45-70 [percent], and oxygen is 84-100 [percent]. I have only one minor problem, and that is my inability to get the suit steam vent temperature down, Deke.
Roger What's it running now?
Well, I'm reading 70 [degrees]. I'm really a little at a loss as to how to get it down, my suit---water valve is set now past the marks. This doesn't seem to being it down, and neither does putting it . . . negative. That's wrong. The cabin was past the marks. The suit temperature is at prelaunch value of about four. I'm going to go to a setting of plus 6 at this time and see if that will bring it down below 70 [degrees]. Over.
Okay. Fine. We're indicating 84 [degrees] suit which is a bit high.
Roger My gage shows 7, 76 [degrees] on the suit.
Rog.
Okay. Let me give you a couple of retrotimes here. You have a 2 Dog nominal; Gold is 03 . . . 29; Hotel 04 32 26.
Roger Understand 26.
We're including your clock is still one second slow.
Roger.
G.m.t. hack of 15 10 42---mark.
Roger. I'm right on and so is the backup.
Roger. Would you send us a blood pressure, please?
Starting. Roger. Starting now.
What mode of communications are you using at this time?
I am on UHF high, Deke.
Fine. Roger. Would you try using your mike button once instead of your VOX. See how this comes in.
Roger Soon as I get through the blood pressure. I can do it now.
This is using the push to talk. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. How now?
I see no difference. They're identical.
Roger: is the modulation pretty good?
Very good.
Roger
Capsule stability, Deke, is very, very, good. I've noticed that I can put in a 1-degree-per-second rate on the needle just by moving heads and arms,--my head and arms. Over.
Very good, excellent. For your information, there will be no flares at Woomera on this pass, since the cloud cover won't allow you to see them anyway.
Roger. I was unsuccessful last pass.
Okay, I'm going to send you a Z cal at this time.
Roger
Mark!
Z cal is coming off.
Roger.
On with R cal.
Roger.
Blood pressure stop.
Blood pressure stop. Okay, we're going to oscillate R cal a couple of times here in attempt to reset our temperature problem.
Roger.
Okay, Rcal off. We suggest you go to manual at this point and preserve your auto fuel. Low at this point.
Roger. Going to manual now.
Roger.
At this time I'm reading 45-70 [percent] on fuel.
Rog. Understand 45-70 [percent].
Cabin.temperature is 107 [degrees].
Cabin 107 [degrees].
I don't believe you've ever received any sunrise, sunset times.
Roger. Give me the whole lot of them, Deke, or the ones that are coming. Give me rise, set, and rise.
Roger. Will do. Your next sunrise will be 02 50 00.
Roger. Copy.
Sunset 03 41 20.
Roger.
Sunrise 04 19 00.
Roger. Copy.
Well, it sounds like you're doing real well up there, Dad.
Roger. It's a little warm.
I suspect so.
Been riding your horse the last couple of days.
Good.
For your information, Cape informs that if we don't stay on manual for quite a spell here we'll probably have to end this orbit.
I'll be sure and stay on manual.
Roger.
You've got a lot of drift left here yet too.
Say again.
You've got drift capability left yet, too.
Roger.
Did you see any lights over the Australian . . .?
I did. That is, Roger. I did see some lights. I couldn't identify them, however.
Roger. Understand.
Would you give us another readout on your suit steam temp? Has this changed any?
It may have gone down just a tad. It's about zero now; I mean about 70 [degrees] now. It was a little bit higher. The visor is closed and I'm beginning to feel a little cooler.
Very good.
We indicated 2-degree drop at suit inlet, so it sounds like you're making out a bit.
Roger. My control mode now, Deke, is manual; gyros free; and the maneuver is off.
Roger. I understand. Manual; gyro free; and maneuver off.
Roger
Aurora Seven, this is Muchea Cap Com. Are you reading?
Still reading, Muchea.
Very good.
We are just kind of leaving you alone. How is your balloon doing, incidentally?
I haven't found it since it got dark. It's--it's--it rambles quite a bit, Deke. It's not inflated fully, and it doesn't stretch out on the line tight like I expected. It bounces in and out and oscillates up and down and sideways. Have no good tensiometer readings yet.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Woomera Cap Com. How do you read? Over.
Hello, Woomera. Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger. You are loud and clear, also.
We copied your transmission over Muchea. Understand you still have the balloon on. Is that an affirmative?
That is affirmative. I have the balloon on. However, I haven't seen it for some time. It wanders quite a bit and I do not have it in sight at this moment. I believe that--it might be visible against the earth background at this time.
Roger. Do you see the moon at all?
I am faced the wrong way and limited in maneuverability I have left because of my fuel state. I can see the terminator between moonlit side, and unmoonlit side. Over.
Roger. Understand.
You are manual control. Is that right?
That is correct. My control mode is manual; gyros free; maneuver off. Over.
Roger. Could you give us . . . could you give us cabin temperature?
Roger. Cabin temperature is 102 [degrees] at this time.
Roger. What is the suit temperature?
Okay, stand by.
Suit temperature is 74 [degrees]; suit steam exhaust is 71 [degree].
Roger. Understand. Are you feeling a little more comfortable at this time?
I don't know. I'm still warm and still perspiring, but not really uncomfortable. I would like to--I would like to nail this suit temperature problem down. It--for all practical purposes, it's uncontrollable as far as I can see.
Roger. Understand. You might have to wait a few more minutes before this takes effect. You are on No. 6. Is that right?
That is right. Suit temperature is No. 6.
Roger. Systems reports that your suit temperature has dropped 2 degrees over station, if that's any encouragement to you.
Roger. Thank you. It is.
Roger.
Have you taken any food thus far?
Yes, I have. However, the food has crumbled badly; and I hate to open the package any more for fear of getting crumbs all over the capsule. I can verify that eating bite-size food as we packaged for this flight is no problem at all. Even the crumbly foods are eaten with no, with no problem.
Roger. How about water?
I had taken four swallows at approximately this time last orbit. As soon as I get the suit temperature pegged a little bit, I'll open the visor and have some more water. Over.
Roger. You are still coming in very loud and clear.
Roger.
. . . out at this time.
For the record now--
One of the labels for a fuse switch has slipped out, and sideways, and has tied the adjoining fuse switch together with it. This happened to emergency-main and reserve-deploy fuse switches.
I caged the gyros. They are too critical. I will try and navigate on the dark side without the gyros.
The fuse switch should be glued in better so that turning off one fuse does not turn off the adjoining one.
I guess I'd better try to get that xylose pill out. I hate to do this.
Oh yes. There is the xylose pill. It didn't melt. All the rest of the stuff in here did melt.
Okay. Xylose pill being consumed at 02 41 35. The rest of the food is pretty much of a mess. Can't stand this cabin temperature.
Hello, Canton Com Tech. Aurora Seven reads you loud and clear. How me?
This is Canton Cap Com. Read you loud and clear. Could you begin your short report, please?
Roger, George. My control mode is manual. The gyros are caged, maneuver is off. Fuel is 45 and 64 [percent], a little ahead of schedule. Oxygen reads 82-100 [percent]. Steam vent temperature in the suit is dropping slightly. It's a little below 70 [degrees]. Cabin is 4.6 [psia]. Suit temperature has dropped to about 71 [degrees] now. All the power is good, and here is a blood pressure. Over.
Okay, standing by for blood pressure.
We are receiving the blood-pressure check. Over.
Roger.
Do you plan on eating as called for by ... Over.
I did have the visor open a short time ago for the xylose pill. All of the rest of the food that I have aboard has either crumbled or melted. It's unusable in its present state so I think the xylose pill will constitute my last zero g meal. However, the first one, before the food crumbled, was quite easy. It's no problem to eat this bite-size food--in a weightless state. I also drank some water at that time, which was no problem.
Roger. I take it, from what you said then, that you have confirmed that your faceplate is closed for the decision on the third orbit.
That is correct. My faceplate is closed. Also, what is the trend of my cabin pressure on the ground? Over.
Stand by, please.
We are checking on your request there, Scott. Could you hit that button again? We lost your EKG.
Oh, you want blood pressure or EKG?
No, we lost the EKG. Possibly you could press on those sensors. Okay, Surgeon informs me that the EKG is now returning. Your other question, cabin pressure is staying at 5.1 [psia] approximately.
Roger. No change in reading since launch. Is that correct?
Negative on that. It's gone from 5.8 [psia] at launch to approximately 5.1 [psia] in very, very gradual descending trend.
Roger. My cabin pressure indicator is reading 4.8 [psia] at this time.
Roger, I have no comment on this, just that the trend appears to be good here on the ground.
Roger.
Do you have any specific comments on your balloon experiments; for example, the best color contrast with the
Yes, I would say the day-glow orange is the best.
Roger. For your information, the second sunrise should be expected in approximately 3 to 4 minutes.
Roger, thank you.
Everything continues to look very good here on the ground. I've got a reading here on the ground for cabin pressure. This is for your information, is 4.8 [psia]. Now, this does take the trend that has been set up considerably. The suit pressure comes in at 4.9 [psia].
Roger.
We find now that the the O2 partial pressure is fluctuating slightly, and the--hanging around 4.2 [psia].
Did you ?
O2 partial pressure is fluctuating--4.2 [psia]--Over.
Roger, copied, George, thank you.
As I said before, everything looks very good here. Surgeon is after me here for you to try another blood pressure. Is this convenient?
Negative. I won't be able to hold still for it now. I've got the sunrise to worry about.
Okay. Roger. We have no further queries. If you have any comments we'll be listening down here.
Negative. I have a beautiful sunrise through the window. I'll record it so you can see it.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, Hawaii Com Tech. How do you read me? Over.
Roger, Hawaii, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Aurora Seven, this is Cap Com. Can you give me a short report, please.
Roger. My control mode is manual; gyros caged; maneuver off. Stand by one. My status is good and the capsule status is good. I want to get some pictures of the sunrise. Over.
Roger. Give me the short report first.
Roger. Fuel is 45-62 [percent]. Over.
Roger. 45 and 62 [percent].
Roger.
Aurora Seven. Did you drink over Canton; did you drink any water over Canton?
That is negative. I will do, shortly.
Roger, Surgeon feels that this is advisable.
Roger.
Do you have an auto-fuel warning light?
That is right. I have reported it, and I believe I reported it a long time ago. It is covered with tape at the moment.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, Cap Com. Cape Flight advises me that we--that they expected the cabin to do such.
Roger, thank you.
. . . temperature exhaust . . . steam exhaust?
Roger. Suit exhaust is 70 [degrees]. Cabin exhaust is 49 [degrees].
Roger.
Aurora Seven. This is Cap Com. Would like for you to return to gyros normal and see what kind of indication we have; whether or not your window view agrees with your gyros.
Roger. Wait one.
I have some more of the white particles in view below the capsule. They appear to be traveling exactly my speed. There is one drifting off. It's going faster than I am as a matter of fact.
Roger. Understand.
I haven't seen the great numbers of these particles, but I've seen a few of them. Their motion is random; they look exactly like snowflakes to me.
Roger. Have you tried returning ...
Negative. Let me get within scanner limits first.
Say again.
I must adjust my attitude to within scanner limits first.
Roger.
There were some more of those--little particles. They definitely look like snowflakes this time.
Roger. Understand. Your particles look like definite snowflakes.
However--
Can we get a blood pressure from you, Scott?
Roger. Blood pressure--start--now. I have the balloon--now--pretty steadily below me, not oscillating. And go to gyros normal. Gyros normal now.
Roger. TM indicates your--zero pitch.
LOS, Scott, we've had LOS. Can you read me? Over.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is California Com Tech, California Com Tech. Do you hear me? Over.
Hello Cal Com Tech, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is California Com Tech, California Com Tech. Do you hear? Over.
Hello. California Com Tech, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
We're reading you loud and clear, also. Stand by for Cap Com.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, California. How do you read?
Hello, Al, loud and clear. How me?
You're loud and clear, Scotty. Short report.
Roger. Control mode is manual, gyros normal, maneuver off. Fuel is 45-50 [percent]. Balloon is out. Oxygen 81-100 [percent]. And my status is good. The capsule status is good, except I'm unable to get a reasonable suit steam exhaust temperature. Still reading 70 [degrees]. Over.
Roger, seems to me as long as suit inlet is going down that you could continue to increase flow until you feel comfortable.
Roger.
Understand you're GO for orbit three.
I am---Roger. I am GO for orbit three.
Seven, this is California.
Go, California.
General Kraft is still somewhat concerned about auto fuel. Use as little auto; use no auto fuel unless you have to prior to retrosequence time. And I think maybe you might increase flow to your inverter heat exchanger to try to bring the temperature down. They are not critical yet, however.
Roger, I have gone from 4 to 5 on the inverter at this time. And I think I'll increase just a tad on the suit.
Roger. You're sounding good here. Give you a period of quiet while I send Z and R cal.
Roger.
Seven, this is California sending Z cal on my mark.
Roger.
One, Mark.
Z cal off.
Roger.
Stand by for R cal 3, 2, 1.
All right now, I'm beginning to get all of those various particles, they--they're way out. I can see some that are a 100 feet out.
Roger. R cal off.
They all look like snowflakes to me. No don't--they do not glow of their own accord.
Roger, Seven. Do you--have you . . . perspire or have you stopped perspiring at the moment?
No, I'm still perspiring, Al. I think I'll open up the visor and take a drink of water.
Roger. Sounds like a good idea.
Seven, would you give us a blood pressure, please, in between swallows.
Okay, there's your blood pressure. I took about 20 swallows of water. Tasted pretty good.
Roger, Seven. We're sure of that, we're getting Alpha times and--Hotel. You have Hotel, I know. How about 3 Alpha?
Roger, and Mark now a tensiometer reading. It's as tight as I've seen the string. Mark another tensiometer reading.
Roger. We have those.
Now say again your last question?
Do you have 3 Alpha of 03 11 00?
03 11 00.
That is correct.
Roger. Copied.
Seven, this is California. Do you still read?
Roger. Loud and clear.
Roger, we have no further inquiries. See you next time.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Guaymas Cap Com.
Hello, Guaymas. Go ahead.
Roger, we're reading you loud and clear. We'd like to conduct a wobulator test here. We use White Sands whenever you give us the word.
Roger, I have one; it's the yaw gyro on the stop at this time.
Is your wobulator on now?
Yes, the wobulator is on.
Roger.
What was that on your yaw?
I have the yaw needle on the 250 stop.
Roger.
I will not cage until after I get rid of the balloon, and then I can start a slow yaw to the left to pick it off the stop.
Roger.
Roger. Can you turn your wobulator on now and leave it on?
Roger. It has been on, and I haven't touched it.
Roger. Understand.
Do you want it off?
Roger. On and off in approximately 20-second intervals.
Okay, wobulator going off--Now.
Roger. We're relaying this.
Am I in a position to do a 360 [degree] roll for them at this time?
Your 00 yaw; you do have a yaw input in.
Could we do this 360 [degree] roll on this pass at White Sands?
Gordo.
Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com.
Roger Cape. Loud and clear and break, break. Guaymas, the wobulator is back on now.
Roger Cape. Go ahead.
Roger Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com back on HF. Give me your report.
Roger. Control mode, manual; gyros normal; the maneuver switch is off. Fuel is 45-45 [percent]; oxygen is 70 [percent], or, correction, oxygen is 80 and 100 [percent]. Suit temperature is 68 [degrees], now and coming down pretty well. Suit steam vent temperature is 69 [degrees], and beginning to be a little more comfortable. Over.
Roger: and how do you feel, now?
I feel pretty good. Still warm.
Okay, sounds like you'll be all right.
Did you--your normal balloon release time will be 3 plus 34, Scott?
3 plus 34, Roger.
Roger, can you describe the balloon and its actions a little to us?
Yes, it has a random drift. There is no oscillation that I can predict whatsoever. The--the line leading to the balloon sometimes is tight; sometimes is loose--loose enough, so that there are loops in it. Its--its behaviour is strictly random as far as I can tell. The balloon is not inflated well either. It's an oblong shape out there, rather than a round figure; and I believe when the sun is on it, the day-glow orange is the most brilliant, and the silver. That's about all I can tell you, Gus.
Roger. Surgeon suggests that you drink as much water as you can. Drink it as often as you can.
Roger.
Retrosequence times for area 3 B and 3 C are nominal.
3 B and 3 C nominal. Roger.
And we recommend you go to normal on your gyros with the maneuver switch off.
Roger. The gyros are normal and the maneuver switch is off.
Roger.
Would you give us your--your temperature control valve settings, please?
Roger, suit is 7.5, cabin is about 10. That's 10 on the cabin and 5 on the inverters. Over.
Roger.
Stand by for Z cal.
Roger, standing by.
R cal.
Mark a tensiometer reading. It's as tight as I've--as it gets.
Aurora Seven, Cap Com.
Go ahead, Cap Com.
. . . drifting flight yet?
Say again.
Have you done any drifting flight?
That is Roger. And if I am to save fuel for retrosequence, I think I better start again. Over.
Roger, I agree with you.
My control mode is now manual; gyros are caged, and I will allow the capsule to drift for a little while.
Roger, and John suggests you try to look back, towards the darkness, at sunrise to see those particles.
Toward the darkness.
Roger. At sunrise, try to look toward the darkness.
Okay, I have done that, and--and--tell him no joy.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, are you in drifting flight?
That is Roger.
Roger.
I am looking down almost vertically. It's possible to distinguish, I believe, four separate cloud layers.
Understand.
Balloon--I'll maneuver enough to get the balloon out in trail so I can photograph its departure.
Roger.
I, incidently, have those little particles visible in the periscope at this time.
Roger. Understand the periscope.
Aurora Seven, Cap Com.
Roger. Go ahead.
We're still fairly happy with your fuel state now. Don't let--we'd like for you not to let either get down below 40 percent.
Roger. I'll try. I have balloon jettison on and off, and I can't get rid of it.
Understand that you can't get rid of the balloon.
That's right. It will not jettison.
Okay.
Aurora seven, Cap Com.
Go ahead, Cap Com.
Give us your blood pressure and fuel reading.
Okay. Fuel is 45-42 [percent]. Blood pressure on the air.
Rog.
I have the particles visible still. They're streaming aft, but in an arc of maybe a 120 or 130 degrees.
Aurora Seven, Cap Com. Say again.
Roger, I have these particles drifting aft again, but they do not parallel the line to the balloon exactly. They drift aft within an arc of maybe 120 to 130 degrees.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Cap Com. Can you give us a comment on the zero g experiment?
Roger. At this moment, the fluid is all gathered around the standpipe; the standpipe appears to be full and the fluid outside the standpipe is about halfway up. There is a rather large meniscus. I'd say about 60° meniscus.
Aurora Seven, Cap Com. Repeat as much of your last message as you can.
Roger. The standpipe is full of the fluid. The fluid is halfway up the outside of the standpipe--a rather large meniscus, on angle of about 60 degrees. Over.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Canary Cap Com on HF. Do you read? Over.
Hello, hello, Canary Cap Com, Aurora Seven. Reading you loud and clear; HF. Transmitting HF. How do you read? Over.
Aurora Seven, this is Canary Cap Com on HF. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Canary Cap Com. Reading you loud and clear; HF. How me? Over.
These pictures of the--small groups of closely knit clouds are south of Canary, third orbit.
This must be crossing [Intertropical Convergence Zone] (ITCZ). I have never seen weather quite like this.
This is Canary Cap Com on HF. Do you receive? Over.
Aurora Seven, this is Canary Cap Com. We had no transmissions from you. This is Canary Islands, signing out.
I have the Voasmeter out at this time.
Hello.
Hello, Canary Cap Com, Aurora Seven. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
Aurora Seven, this is Canary Cap Com. Do you read? Over.
Go ahead, Canary. Reading you loud and clear.
I am going--I am in the record only position now. I think the best answer to the autokinesis--is that there is none. I noticed none--and I tend to aline the horizontal with my head--it--a horizontal line under zero g is a line parallel to the line drawn between your eyes. I don't get autokinesis. I don't get--now wait a minute, maybe I'm beginning to.
I should remark that at 3 26 33, I have.in the sky, at any time, 10 particles. They no doubt appear to glow to me. They appeared to be little pieces of frost. However. some appear to be way, way far away. There are two--that look like they might be a 100 yards away. I haven't operated the thruster not for some time. Here are two in closer. Now a densiometer reading on these that are in close. Extinct at 5.5, the elapsed time is 3 27 39. I am unable to see any stars in the black sky at this time. However, these little snowflakes are clearly visible.
The cabin temperature has dropped considerable now, and the setting I have on the suit is 7.
Am going to increase it just a tad more.
My suit valve, water valve temperature now is--about 8.
Hello, hello, Kano Cap Com, Aurora Seven. Reading you loud and clear. How me?
I've noticed that every time I turn over to the right everything seems vertical, but I am upside down.
Now, for the record.
I still feel that, I could easily feel like I am coming in on my back.
I could very easily come in from another planet, and feel that I am on my--on my back, and that earth is up above me, but that's sorta the way you feel when you come out of split S, or out of an Immelmann.
Keno on HF. If you read me, the surgeon requests that you take a blood-pressure check now, a blood-pressure check for the onboard record. Over.
Roger. Reading you, Keno, loud and clear. Blood pressure start at this time.
Visor is coming closed now.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is Kano Cap Com. If you read me, would you do a blood-pressure check for the onboard records. Over.
Okay. I'm taking the--I've taken the big back off; going to record only, at this time. Have taken the big back off of the camera and trying to get some more MIT film at this time. The filter is in. The cassette--is in the camera.
The zero g senta sensations are wonderful. This is the first time I've ever worn this suit and had it comfortable.
I don't know which way I'm pointed, and don't particularly care.
Roger. At this time I am hearing Kano calling for a blood-pressure check. I will give it to him now. Let's see, I have fuel 45-43, still would like to get just a little rate--just a little one.
Let's see, we wanta go back that way.
I can't see any relationship between thruster action and the fireflies.
Mark MIT pictures to 3 35 36, crank two by--at infinity.
Coastal passage over Africa.
I'm taking many MIT pictures, at capsule elapsed [time] 03 38 38. It will be the only chance we have. I might as well use up all the film.
Hello, Indian Com Tech, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Aurora Seven, this is IOS Com Tech, on HF and UHF. How do you read? Over.
Roger Loud and clear. How me, Indian Cap Com?
Aurora Seven, this is Indian Cap Com. I did not read all of your transmission, but the part I monitored was loud and clear. Go ahead.
Roger. My status is good, the capsule status is good. I am in drifting flight on manual control. Gyros are caged. The fuel reads 45-42 [percent], oxygen 79-100 [percent]. Steam vent temperatures both read 65 [degrees] now; suit temperature has gone down nicely. It is now 62 [degrees], and all the power is good. The blood pressure is starting at this time. I've just finished taking some MIT pictures, and that is all I have to report at this time.
Roger, Aurora Seven. I copy your control mode manual; gyro caged; fuel 45-42 [percent]; oxygen 79-100 [percent]; and I did not hear the last part of your transmission. How do--
Roger. My status is good; the suit temperature has reduced considerably; steam vent temperatures now read 69 [degrees] on cabin and suit, suit temperature is 62 [degrees], and cabin temperature is 101 [degrees]. Over.
Roger. Suit temperature 62 [degrees], and cabin temperature 101 [degrees]. Your blood pressure is starting--and understand you are on the manual. Understand also you are drifting for awhile.
That is Roger. I am.
Confirm.
I am on manual control. I am allowing the capsule to drift. Over.
Roger.
Also another departure from the plan is the fact that I have been unable to jettison the balloon. The balloon is still attached--should be no problem.
Roger. Understand no problem expected, but balloon is still attached. Stand by.
Aurora Seven, this is Indian Cap Com. All our retrosequence times are nominal. Do you want me to call them out to you? Over.
Negative. I have them all, thank you.
Aurora Seven, your last transcription was unreadable. You are fading badly, although intermittently. I will read retrosequence times in the blind. Area 3 Delta, 04 12 32, 04 12 32; Echo 04 22 27; 3 Echo 04 22 27; and the last . . . we have is 04 32 26... now and your capsule clock is still within 1 second.
Roger, Kano. I copied all that.
Roger, Aurora. You were loud and clear.
The sunsets are most spectacular. The earth is black after the sun has set. The earth is black; the first band close to the earth is red, the next is yellow; the next is blue; the next is green; and the next is sort of a--sort of a purple. It's almost like a very brilliant rainbow. It extends at some
Indian Cap Com. Check you see about all colors between the horizon and the night sky. You seem to see more layers than Friendship Seven.
Roger. These layers extend from at least 90 degrees either side of the sun at sunset.
Aurora Seven, I did not hear your whole sentence. Will you repeat, please? Over.
Roger. This bright horizon band extends at least 90° north and south of the position of the sunset.
Roger. Understand. About the balloon, does Mercury Control Center know you did not--
Yes. I tried to release it over their station and was unable to do so. You might remind them that the balloon is still on.
Roger, Aurora Seven. Understand.
Aurora Seven, Indian Cap Com. Your inverter temperatures are 183 [degrees] for the 150, and 195 [degrees] for the 250. All your other primaries check out okay on telemetry.
Roger. Thank you very much.
Aurora Seven, do you read? Over.
Go ahead, Indian Cap Com.
Our medical monitor says that we are reading your respiration. I believe this is almost the first time it's come across.
That's very good. I guarantee I'm breathing.
Roger. Understand.
The eye patch is in place, this time.
Going to record--record only at this time.
At 3 hours and 48 minutes and 51 seconds elapsed, I'm taking a good swig of water. It's pretty cool this time. Stretching my legs a tad. It's quite dark. I'm in drifting flight. Oh, boy! It feels good to get that leg stretched out. That one and the right one too.
I drank an awful lot of water and I'm still thirsty. As a matter of fact, I think there-- there is a leak in the urinal, I'm sure.
Okay, line touch.
Okay. I'm shaking my head violently from all sides, with eyes closed, up and down, pitch, roll, yaw. Nothing in my stomach; nothing anywhere. There is now--I will try to poke zero, time zero button. Well, I missed it. I was a little disoriented as to exactly where things are, not sure exactly what you want to accomplish by this but there is no problem of orienting. Your--your--inner ears and your mental appraisal of horizontal, you just adapt to this environment, like--like you were born in it. It's a great, great freedom.
Don't let me forget about the shiny finish on the star chart. It makes it very hard to read.
At 3 53.
I'm using the photometer now--to try and get--a reading. I saw a com--no, it's the balloon that I see, still drifting aimlessly, lighted by moonlight at this time.
None of the colors are--particularly visible. I think--
Excess cabin water light is on at this time, 03 56 24. Am going to turn it down just a tad-- so it will be just about where the suit is. I would say, let's see, from that, that it jumped down to freezing.
Hello, Muchea Cap Com, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Coming in loud and clear.
Roger. Deke, my control mode is manual; gyros are caged; the maneuver switch is off. My fuel reads 45 and 42 [percent]; the oxygen is reading 76 and 100 [percent]; steam vent temperatures are 68 [degrees] on the suit and I just got excess cabin water light; the needle dropped down to 20. Reset cabin water at about 6 and in this capsule it seems optimum settings are right between 6 and 7. Outside of that, all things, all systems are good. And blood pressure is starting now.
Roger. Okay, starting blood pressure.
The visor has been open for some time, I've been taking some readings on stars through the haze layer with the photometer. The visor is coming closed now.
Roger. Understand visor coming closed.
I'll give you retro time for end of mission and would like to have you set the clock to this at this time.
Roger.
32 34
Understand, 04 32 34.
Good.
Okay. It's going into the clock now--whoop.
We indicate 35.
I do, too. I overshot. Stand by.
That's probably close enough for government work.
For you, to the second.
Roger. Still you indicate 1 second slow on g.e.t.; we indicate you on, on retrotime.
Roger. I am reading 04 32 34.
Would you please exercise prior to your second blood pressure.
Roger. I'll give you the calibrated exercise at this time.
Roger.
Exercise start, now.
Okay, blood pressure start, now. That was 60 cycles in 30 seconds on the exerciser.
60 cycles in 30 seconds.
Did you by any chance try T/M keying over the Cape on your last pass?
I think I may have to mark time for tensiometer reading on the balloon.
Very good.
Understand you still have the balloon with you. It's possible if you go to deploy position and back to release, you can--
Roger. I've tried that a number of times, Deke. I just can't get rid of it.
Okay. Well, she'll probably come into your face on retrofire; but I'm sure you'll lose it shortly after that.
Yeah, I figure. I hope so.
Okay, for your information, cloud--is five-tenths and it's only one-eighth to the north over Port Moresby; so if you see some lights up in that area, we'd like to know about it.
Roger, I'll let you know.
Could you give us a c.e.t, hack, please.
Roger. C.e.t. on my mark will be 4 hours 1 minute, 35 seconds, stand by. MARK, 4 01 35.
Roger. Still one second off; that's fine.
The flight plan calls for you to have a drink of water over here. Do you feel like you need one--
Roger. I just, I have had three long drinks of water. The last one was, I think, about 10 minutes ago, Deke.
You're probably loaded for bear, then.
Roger.
--?
Roger. Deke, the haze layer is very bright. I would say 8 to 10 degrees above the real horizon. And I would say that the haze layer is about twice as high above the horizon as the--the bright blue band at sunset is; it's twice as thick. A star, stars are occluded as we pass through this haze layer. I have a good set of stars to watch going through at this time. I'll try and get some photometer readings.
Roger. Understand. It's twice as--sunset.
It is not twice as thick. It's thinner, but it is located at a distance about twice as far away as the top of the--the band at sunset.
Understand.
It's very narrow, and as bright as the horizon of the earth itself.
Rog.
This is a reading on Phecda in--in the Big Dipper prior to entry in the, the, into the haze layer. It occludes--it is extinct at roughly 2.5. The reticle extincts at 5.5. TM mark for the time in the middle of the haze layer. Spica--stand by.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this Woomera Cap Com. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Stand by, Woomera.
Roger. Standing by.
In the middle of the haze layer, Phecda will not--I can't even get a reading on it through the photometer. Phecda is now below the horizon, or below and mark about 5 seconds ago, now it emerged from the brightest part of the haze layer. It is now clearly visible. Woomera, my status is very good, fuel is 45 and 42 [percent]. Standby, I'll give you a full report very shortly.
Roger. Standing by.
Visor coming open.
Roger. Visor open.
Aurora Seven, this is Woomera. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Woomera, loud and clear.
You say visor is open?
That's negative. I did not open it. I won't open it until I get through with these readings. Phecda now extincts at 1.7 in the mid, in mid position between the haze layer and the earth. Okay, Woomera, my--my status is very good. The suit temperature is coming down substantially. Steam vent temperature is not down much, but the suit environment temperature is 60 [degrees]. I'm quite comfortable. Cabin temperature is 101 [degrees]; cabin is holding an indicated 4.8; oxygen is 75-100 [percent], all d-c power continues to be good, 20 Amps; both a-c busses are good; fuel reads 46 and 40 [percent]. I am in drifting flight. I have had plenty of water to drink. The visor is coming open now. And blood pressure is coming your way at this time.
Hello, Woomera, Woomera Cap Com, this is Aurora Seven. Did you copy my last? Over.
Cabin temperature, cabin water flow is all the way off and reducing back to about 7.5 now, a little bit less. At this time cabin steam vent going to record only.
Cabin steam vent is 10; suit steam vent is 62. I would like to have a little bit more pad on the temperature, but I can't seem to get it. The suit temperature is 60 [degrees]; the cabin temperature continues at 102 [degrees]. I have 22 minutes and 20 seconds left for retrofire. I think that I will try to get some of this equipment stowed at this time.
There is the moon.
Looks no different--here than it does on the ground.
Visor is open and the visor is coming closed now at this time.
I have put the moon--in the center of the window and it just drifts very, very little.
There seems to be a stagnant place in the, my helmet. The suit is cool, but along my face it's warm.
And there is Scorpio.
All right, let's see.
It's very interesting to remark that my attitude--and the--is roughly pitchup plus 30 [degrees], roll right 130 [degrees], and yaw left 20 [degrees]. The balloon at this time is moving right along with me. It's keeping a constant bearing at all times. There is the horizon band again; this time from the moonlit side. Let me see, with the airglow filter, it's very difficult to do this because of the lights from that time correlation clock. Visor coming open now. It's impossible to get dark-adapted in here, with that light the way it is.
All right for the record. Interesting, I believe. This haze layer is very bright through the airglow filter. Very bright. The time now is 4 17 44.
Now, let me see, I'll get an accurate band width.
That's very handy, because the band width--there is the sun ... The horizon band width is exactly equal to the X. I can't explain it; I'll have to, to--
Sunrise. Ahhhhh! Beautiful lighted fireflies that time. It was luminous that time. But it's only, okay, they--all right, I have--if anybody reads, I have the fireflies. They are very bright. They are capsule emanating. I can rap the hatch and stir off hundreds of them. Rap the side of the capsule; huge streams come out. They--some appear to glow. Let me yaw around the other way.
Some appear to glow but I don't believe they really do; it's just the light of the sun. I'll try to get a picture of it. They're brilliant. I think they would really shine through 9 on the photometer. I'll rap. Let's see.
Taking some pictures at F 2.8 and bulb. The pictures now, here, one of the balloon. The sun is too bright now. That's where they come from. They are little tiny white pieces of frost. I judge from this that the whole side of the capsule must have frost on it.
Aurora Seven, this is Hawaii Com Tech, how do you read?
Hello, Hawaii, loud and clear. How me?
Hawaii Com Tech.
Seven, Hawaii Com Tech, I read you momentarily on UHF. How do you read? Over.
Roger, reading you loud and clear Hawaii. How me?
Aurora Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. How do you read me?
Roger, Do you read me or do you not, James?
Gee, you are weak; but I read you. You are readable. Are you on UHF-Hi?
Roger, UHF-Hi.
Roger, Orientate the spacecraft and go to the ASCS.
Roger, Will do.
Roger, Copied, Going into orbit attitude at this time.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, do you copy? Over.
Roger. Copy. Going into orbit attitude at this time.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Hawaii Cap Com. Do you read me? Over.
Roger. Go ahead, Hawaii.
Is your maneuver switch off?
The maneuver switch is off.
Roger. Are you ready to start your pre-retrosequence checklist?
Roger. One moment.
I'm alining my attitudes. Everything is fine. I have part of the stowage checklist taken care of at this time.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, do you wish me to read out any of the checklist to you?
Roger. Let me get the stowage and then you can help me with the pre-retrograde.
Roger. Standing by.
Aurora Seven, can we get on with the checklist? We have approximately 3 minutes left of contact.
Roger. Go ahead with the checklist. I'm coming to retroattitude now and my control mode is automatic and my attitudes-standby. Wait a minute, I have a problem in.
I have an ASCS problem here. I think ASCS is not operating properly. Let me-- Emergency retrosequence is armed and retro manual is armed. I've got to evaluate this retro--this ASCS problem, Jim, before we go any further.
Roger. Standing by. Make sure your emergency drogue deploy and emergency main fuses are off.
Roger. They are. Okay, I'm going now to fly-by-wire, to Aux Damp, and now--attitudes do not agree. Five minutes to retrograde; light is on. I have a rate of descent, too, of about 10, 12 feet per second.
Say again, say again.
I have a rate of descent of about 12 feet per second.
What light was on?
Yes, I am back on fly-by-wire, trying to orient.
Scott, let's try and get some of this retrosequence list checked off before you get to California.
Okay. Go through it, Jim.
Roger. Jim, go through the checklist for me.
Roger. Squib switch armed; auto retrojettison switch off; gyros normal; manual handle out; roll, yaw and pitch handles in.
Roll, yaw, and pitch are in.
Retroattitude auto; retract scope auto; maneuver switch off; periscope lever up; UHF-Hi power; transmit on UHF; beacon continuous; VOX power on transmit and record; all batteries checked. Do you copy?
Roger. It's complete.
Transmitting in the blind. We have LOS. Ground elapsed time is on my mark, 4 hours 29 minutes and 30 seconds. Transmitting in the blind to Aurora Seven. Make sure all your tone switches are on; your warning lights are bright; the retro manual fuse switch is on; the retrojettison fuse switch is off. Check your faceplate and make sure that it is closed.
Aurora Seven. Did you copy?
Roger. Copied all; I think we're in good shape. I'm not sure just what the status of the ASCS is at this time.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, this is California Com Tech, California Com Tech. Do you hear? Over.
Hello, California Com Tech. Loud and clear. How me?
I'm reading you loud and clear also. Stand by for Cap Com.
Seven, this is Cap Com. Are you in retroattitude?
Yes, I don't have agreement with ASCS in the window, Al. I think I'm going to have to go to fly-by-wire and use the window and the scope. ASCS is bad. I'm on fly-by-wire and manual.
Roger. We concur. About 30 seconds to go.
About 10 seconds on my mark.
Roger.
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
Retrosequence is green.
Roger. Check ASCS quickly to see if orientation mode will hold.
If your gyros are off, you'll have to use attitude bypass.
Gyros are off.
But you'll have to use attitude bypass and manual override.
Roger.
4, 3, 2, 1, 0.
Okay. Fire 1, fire 2, and fire 3. I had to punch off manually. I have a little bit of smoke in the capsule.
Attitudes hold, Scotty.
Okay, I think they held well, Al. The--I think they were good. I can't tell you what was wrong about them because the gyros were not quite right. But retrojettison--3 fuse switches are on.
Roger. We should have retrojettison in about 10 seconds.
Roger.
That was a nice gentle bump. All three have fired. Retroattitude was red.
Roger. Should have retrojettison now.
Ah, right then at 34 10, on time.
Roger. How much fuel do you have left both tanks?
I have 20 and 5 [percent].
Roger. I guess we'd better use--
I'll use manual.
---on reentry, unless ASCS holds you in reentry attitude.
Yes, it can. I'll have to do it with manual.
Roger. Recommend you try Aux Damp first; if it's not working, then go to fly-by-wire.
Okay, I'll have to do that.
The balloon is gone [out of sight]. I am apparently out of manual fuel. I have to go to fly-by-wire to stop this tumbling.
Roger. Using fly-by-wire to stop tumbling.
Aurora Seven. Understand RSCS did not work.
I am out of manual fuel, Al.
Roger.
.05 g should be when?
Oh, you have plenty of time. It should be 04 44 elapsed time
Roger.
You have plenty of time. Take your time on fly-by-wire to get into reentry attitude.
Roger.
I was just looking over your reentry checklist. Looks like you're in pretty good shape. You'll have to manually retract the scope.
No. I didn't. The scope did come in, Al.
Roger. I didn't get that. Very good.
How are you doing on reentry attitude? Over.
Stowing a few things first. I don't know yet. Take a while.
Okay.
Going to be tight on fuel.
Roger You have plenty of time; you have about 7 minutes before .05 g so take . . .
Roger.
Okay. I can make out very, very small--farm land, pasture land below. I see individual fields, rivers, lakes, roads, I think. I'll get back to reentry attitude.
Roger Seven, recommend you get close to reentry attitude, using as little fuel as possible and stand by on fly-by-wire until rates develop. Over.
Roger. Will do.
Seven, this is California. We're losing you now. Stand by for Cape.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com. Over.
Hello Cape Cap Com, Aurora Seven. Loud and clear.
Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com. Over.
Hello, Cape Cap Com. Go ahead.
Roger. Do you have your face, faceplate closed?
Negative. It is now. Thank you.
Roger. Give me your fuel, please.
Fuel is 15 [percent] auto. I'm indicating 7 [percent] manual, but it is empty and ineffective.
Roger. You have a few minutes to start of blackout.
Two minutes, you say?
Aurora Seven, Cap Com.
Go ahead, Cap Com.
Just wanted to hear from you.
Roger. It's going to be real tight on fuel, Gus. I've got the horizon in view now. Trying to keep rates very low. I just lost part of the balloon. The string from the balloon.
. . . checklist.
Yes. We're in good shape for stowage.
Aurora Seven, have you completed your reentry ...
Roger.
Check.
The weather in the recovery area is good. You've got overcast cloud; 3-foot waves; 8 knots of wind; 10 miles visibility; and the cloud bases are at 1,000 feet.
Roger.
Will give you some more as soon as we get an IP.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Cap Com. Will you check your glove compartment and make sure it's latched and your ...
Roger, it's tight.
Rog.
Starting into blackout anytime now.
Roger.
Roger. We show you still have some manual fuel left.
Yes, but I can't get anything out of it.
Roger.
Aurora Seven, Cap Com. Do you still read?
Roger. Loud and clear.
I don't have a roll rate in yet. I'll put some in when I begin to get the g buildup.
I only was reading 0.5 g's on the accelerometer. Okay, here come some rates.
I've got the orange glow. I assume we're in blackout now. Gus, give me a try. There goes something tearing away.
Okay. I'm setting in a roll rate at this time.
Going to Aux Damp.
I hope we have enough fuel. I get the orange glow at this time.
Bright orange glow.
Picking up just a little acceleration now.
Not much glow: just a little. Reading 0.5 g. Aux Damp seems to be doing well My fuel, I hope, holds out. There is 1 g. Getting a few streamers of smoke out behind. There's some green flashes out there.
Reentry is going pretty well. Aux Damp seems to be keeping oscillations pretty good. We're at 1 1/2 g's now. There was a large flaming piece coming off. Almost looked like it came off the tower.
Oh, I hope not.
Okay. We're reading 3 g's, think we'll have to let the reentry damping check go this time. Reading now 4 g's. The reentry seems to be going okay. The rates there that Aux Damp appears to be handling. I don't think I'm oscillating too much; seem to be rolling right around that glow--the sky behind. Auto fuel still reads 14 (percent) at 6.5 g's. Rates are holding to within 1 1/2 degrees per second indicating about 10 degrees per second roll rate. Still peaked at 6.8 g's. The orange glow has disappeared now. We're off peak g. Still indicating 14 [percent] auto fuel; back to 5 g's.
And I'm standing by for altimeter off the peg. Cape, do you read yet? Altimeter is off the peg. 100 [1,000] ft., rate of descent is coming down, cabin pressure is--cabin pressure is holding okay. Still losing a few streaming. No, that's shock waves. Smoke pouring out behind. Getting ready for the drogue at 45 [1,000 ft].
Oscillations are pretty good. I think ASCS has given up the ghost at this point. Emergency drogue fuse switch is on.
Roger. Aurora Seven, reading okay. Getting some pretty good oscillations now and we're out of fuel. Looks from the sun like it might be about 45 degrees. Oww, it's coming like--it's really going over.
Think I'd better take a try on the drogue. Drogue out manually at 25 [1,000 ft.]. It's holding and it was just in time. Main deploy fuse switch is on now, 21 [1,000 ft.] indicated [altitude].
Snorkle override now. Emergency flow rate on. Emergency main fuse switch at 15 [1,000 ft.], standing by for the main chute at 10 [1,000 ft.].
Cabin pressure, cabin altimeter agree on altitude. Should be 13,000 [feet] now. Mark 10; I see the main is out, and reefed, and it looks good to me. The main chute is out. Landing bag goes to auto now. The drogue has fallen away. I see a perfect chute, visor open. Cabin temperature is only 110 [degrees] at this point. Helmet hose is off.
Does anybody read. Does anybody read Aurora Seven? Over.
Hello, any Mercury recovery force. Does anyone read Aurora Seven? Over.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com. Over.
Roger. Say again. You're very weak.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com. Over.
Roger. I'm reading you. I'm on the main chute at 5,000 [feet]. Status is good. I am not in contact with any recovery forces. Do you have any information on the recovery time? Over.
Hello, any Mercury recovery forces. How do you read Aurora Seven? Over.
Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com. Over.
Roger. Loud and clear. Aurora Seven reading the Cape. Loud and clear. How me, Gus?
Gus, how do you read?
Aurora Seven... 95. Your landing point is 200 miles long. We will jump the air rescue people to you.
Roger. Understand. I'm reading.
Aurora Seven, Aurora Seven, Cape Cap Com. Be advised your landing point is long. We will jump air rescue people to you in about 1 hour.
5, 4, 3
I have the lift-off. Clock has started. And she feels real nice.
Wally, you got a pin for this flight?
Yeah, I got the pins on my office wall. Altimeter's off the peg.
Standby for 20 seconds.
Okay.
2, 1, MARK.<sup>T</sup>
Roger. Backup started and running good. I'll give you a hack at my 30 (seconds). Ah, she's riding beautiful Deke.
Looks real fine from here.
MARK 30. Okay. Fuel is okay. Oxygen is okay. All systems appear go, and she's getting noisy.
Not at all too noisy. Easy to talk through.
Main cabin pressure is remaining on schedule. Fuel is okay. Oxygen is okay. Cabin pressure, 10 psi, and she's really moving.
Cape Cap Com Sigma Seven. Do you read? Over.
Cape Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. How do you read? Over.
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven. I read you. Over.
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven. I read. I am broadcasting in the blind. g is building. All systems are go here.
Roger. How do you read now, Wally?
I read you beautiful.
You had your transmitter keyed, that's why we couldn't read.
I'll be darn. I'm push-to-talk now.
Standby for staging.
I have a BECO. I could see the flash.
Staging.
Roger, staging. Standing by for tower. Fuel looks good. Oxygen looks good.
Roger. Start a new flight.
Okay. I'm on push-to-talk, and the sun is coming in the window now. Okay. There goes the tower.
Roger.
Auto retrojett off. This tower really is a sayonara.
That pitch should be about -10 (degrees).
Roger. I have about -5. Cabin pressure is holding very well at, right at 6 psi.
Roger.
And I'll give and electrical check now.
Roger.
Okay, a-c and d-c are all in the green. It looks real good.
Roger.
I'll go back on VOX again. How do you read me on VOX now?
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven.
Go ahead, Seven.
Okay. I'm back on push-to-talk.
Roger. You have a go from Control Center.
Roger. You have a go from me. It's real fat.
Roger. Have a go from here.
Roger. It looks real good.
Are you a turtle today?
Going to VOX record only. You bet (Correct answer recorded).
Just trying to catch you on that one.
Nope - okay. I've finished VOX record.
Coming upon 4 minutes. I'll give you a hack.
Good head.
MARK.<sup>T</sup>
Roger. Right on the nose . . . 3 pitch.
Okay, and I've got good fuel, about 101-95 (percent). Oxygen is fat 65-52 (psi in hundreds), correction 72.
Roger.
She's starting to build up now.
Roger.
Sunlight's in my upper right hand corner of the window, just peeking in at me.
Roger.
How's the V/Vr?
I get a 0.8 V/Vr.
Good show.
Standby for SECO.
SECO.
I have SECO. Cap sep, and in aux damp, and it's very pleasant. Going to fly-by-wire low. Going to fly-by-wire.
Roger. Fly-by-wire.
Yaw is answering very nicely. Roll answers nicely. She's turning around very nicely.
You have a go, 7 orbit capability.
Say again, I like that kind.
I see little ice crystals, I'm sure that's what it is around me now.
You're a little garbled.
Okay. Got a good view of the earth now.
Coming around to retroattitude. Coming into retroattitude; and a good shot of the sustainer here. It's right in the window where it belongs. I am pitched up a little bit.
Roger.
Okay. Just about into retroattitude.
Roger. We have full communications. Tell me, can you confirm retrojett off?
That's affirmative. Retrojett is off.
That's fine.
Okay. I'm getting set up for yaw. I can see yaw at (-) 34 already.
You say you still have some yaw.
Roger. I just went into ASCS at about 7 minutes and 10 seconds. The sustainer is sitting very steady above me. I should say above the horizon. And I'm in chimp mode right now and she is flying beautifully.
I'll give you (contingency recovery area) 1-B retro 16 22.
Roger. Understand 16 22. Is that correct?
Roger. 16 22.
Okay. I've got my chart case out. I'll put that in. I'll send the blood pressure now for the medics.
Roger.
Boy! That sustainer looks real cute. I'll pick her up in a moment and track her.
For your information, you are slightly garbled - slightly garbled.
Okay. I'll use VOX-push-to-talk as much as possible.
Roger.
Okay, I'm stopping that blood pressure run. Boy! This ASCS made tracking very nice. The sustainer is very stable. It is not oscillating at all. I see no vapors; it looks very clean.
28 25
Say again Deke.
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven. Say again.
Seven, Cap Com. You are fading - you are fading.
Roger.
Cape Cap Com. I read you loud and clear.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, Cape Cap Com. How do you read?
Cape Cap Com, this is Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear. How me?
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven. How do you read? Over.
This is Sigma Seven. Squib off. Three retro fuse switches on. Fire-arm on. Going to fly-by-wire low.
This is Sigma Seven. Tracking sustainer very easily in fly-by-wire low.
Am going to manual proportional.
This is Sigma Seven. I am now in ASCS auto, retroattitude. Manual proportional works very well.
Canary Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. Over.
Sigma Seven this is Canary Com Tech. Transmitting HF/UHF. Do you read? Over.
Roger. Canary Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. Do you read me?
Sigma Seven this is Canary Cap Com. Reading you loud and clear. We have valid radar track.
Roger. Good show on radar. Awfully sorry our friend Julian couldn't be with us. I would like to give you my report on control mode. First off, manual and fly-by-wire low are excellent; aux damp works excellent. I am now in auto mode; retroattitude. Attitudes holding beautifully. I am go. My suit temperature is going up a bit. I have set it at 4.5. Over.
Roger. I copied suit temperature at 4.5. What does your suit temperature read?
Negative. That was suit dome - is reading 75 (degrees). I have set the suit at 4.5.
Roger.
I am checking on my cabin. It's about 60 (degrees). I am going to leave it alone. The cabin heat exchanger is about 48 (degrees).
Roger.
Canary, as far as I am concerned all control systems are perfect. The manual was slightly sluggish as predicted, but better than I have seen.
Roger. Are you on UHF-hi at this time?
That is affirmative, and will be switching to UHF-lo for a check with you shortly.
Roger.
I have made an electrical check. We had communication problems on the way across. And all the systems checked out very well. Oxygen is holding up very well. I will give the suit circuit a little more time to cool down.
My suit temperature at this time is 68 (degrees). I am not worried about it yet.
Roger.
Everything else is green.
Roger.
I am going to go to gyros free for a Ts + 5 check.
Roger.
I have a (recovery area) 2-1 retrosequence time if you want it.
Roger. Standby.
01 28 21.
Roger. Correction to 2-1. 01 28 21.
That's confirm.
Roger.
Okay. Looks like the dome is coming down a little bit. I'll stick with this setting for awhile.
Which dome is that?
That is the suit dome. The cabin dome is 55 (degrees).
Roger 5.
Canary Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. Do you read?
I copy cabin dome setting at 5.5 and suit dome at 4.5.
Now those are not settings. Let me go over that. Suit dome temperature is 75 (degrees). Cabin dome temperature is 56 (degrees). Suit setting on the coolant valve is 4.5. Cabin setting is 4. Do you understand?
I copy now.
Okay. Going back to gyros normal. Ts+5 confirmed.
Roger.
I see we're coming across the coast. I haven't used the periscope too much as yet.
Roger. Are you on UHF-hi yet - or lo yet?
Negative. I will switch to lo now before I lose you. VOX off.
Canary Cap Com, Sigma Seven. On UHF-lo. How do you read?
Kano Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. On UHF-lo. How do you read? Over.
Kano Cap Com, Kano Cap Com, Sigma Seven. UHF-lo. How do you read?
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Kano Com Tech transmitting on UHF/HF. Do you read? Over.
Roger. Kano Cap Com. Do you read me? UHF-lo. Over.
Roger. Standby this frequency, Seven, for Cap Com.
Okay.
Hello Sigma Seven this is Kano Cap Com. Standing by for your short report.
Roger. I am go. All system are go. I am in ASCS auto; maneuver is off. My Tr-10 bypass is to normal. The fuel and oxygen are all green. Everything is green. I am fat here. I would like a CET time check.
Understand you want a CET ground check.
That's correct.
Roger. At my mark it will be 22 10. MARK. <sup>T</sup>
Roger. I am right on.
I am changing my suit setting to almost 5. Over.
Understand. Changing suit setting to number 5.
That is correct. The dome temperature is at this time approximately 77 (degrees). I will leave it at number 5 for at least 10 minutes.
Kano Cap Com standing by for any further reports, Sigma Seven.
Roger. Kano. Looks like you got good weather down there.
That's affirm. Do your attitude displays check with your visual reference?
Very well. I noticed that the yaw reticle is performing quite well. I've been using it crossing land here.
Roger. Understand.
I am going to try some of the periscope now. Rather unusual sight through the periscope. Not as thrilling as through the window, I'll have to admit.
Understand.
Looks like we are coming up on some cloudy weather.
Seven, our telemetry pitch attitude shows about 27 (degrees) minus and your scanner output shows about - oh, -36 (degrees).
Roger. I'm right on -34 (degrees). It correlates with the window reference mark and I feel quite content we are right on.
Very good.
How is your suit temperature doing now?
The suit temperature is now . . . still going up a little bit, it's about 72 (degrees). I am setting at suit . . . number 5 and I'll give it a little more time to try to cool down.
As soon as we have got a reverse in flow of this dome temperature we'll have a cut at it, I think.
Roger.
Okay, we are picking up some pretty fair clouds now.
My inverters look real good.
Roger. Understand. What does your suit dome temperature look like now?
It looks like it is holding. I may have to increase it after a little while. I'll let it sit for awhile.
All the T/M systems look good, Seven.
Roger. I think the only problem I have is the suit circuit. I'll work on it for awhile and see how we are.
Takes a wee bit of time for that to stablize?
Right. That's what I am trying to do.
The dome now is still holding at 78 (degrees). I think I will let it set for a little bit longer.
Say again that temperature.
The suit dome is 78 (degrees).
Understand.
Cabin dome is 60 (degrees).
Cabin dome - Kano this is Sigma Seven. Do you read?
LOS Seven.
Roger. Cabin dome is working very well. It's just fluctuating.
Roger.
It goes between 52 and 58 (degrees). And I owe Frank Samonski, so far at least, 50 cents.
At this time, I have three axes practically on retroattitude. The yaw through the reticle usually observed as a rate and I am now trying to check for a change in attitude in yaw. I do notice that one cloud, even, gives you an attitude immediately as a reference. It's almost too accurate for the actual observation that I have within the capsule.
I am now going to low mag. Correction high mag on the periscope see how it looks? . . . yawed right about 5 degrees. See how she matches up with the periscope at this point. Say, we have the yaw axes (indicator) at about 10 degrees right, at this time, and clouds are tracking right up the line, as if the yaw axes might be off by as much as 5 to 6 degrees. Now this may be a minor problem; we will have to observe it.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, . . . HF and UHF.
Hello Kano. This is Sigma Seven. You are both coming in broken but clear. Over.
Sigma Seven. Standby for Cap Com. Over.
Roger.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Zanzibar Cap Com. Over.
Kano Cap Com, you are coming in weak and broken. Gver.
This is Zanzibar Cap Com, Zanzibar Cap Com. Over.
Roger. Zanzibar. Sorry I miscalled you. I am going to set my . . . setting on the suit coolant valve to 5.5. Over.
Zanzibar this is Sigma Seven. Do you read?
Seven this is Zanzibar. You were cutting out. I didn't get your last message. Will you repeat?
Roger. Standby, I'm switching to UHF-hi.
Roger.
Hello, Zanzibar this is Sigma Seven. How do you read? Over.
Seven this is Zanzibar Cap Com. Read you loud and clear now. Go ahead.
Roger. I have set my suit control valve to 5.5. The suit dome temperature is 80 (degrees). Over.
Roger. Understand.
The cabin dome is 55 (degrees) and is apparently under control.
Roger. Understand.
My suit temperature has come down to 75 (degrees) at this time.
Roger.
In fact, that's a correction, it hasn't come down. It's just going there. I would like to give you a briefing on my control mode. I am in auto mode, the bypass switch is normal, maneuver off. Fuel is in the green. Oxygen is way in the green. All electrical is in the green.
Roger. Seven. Your (recovery area) 2-1 retrosequence time is 01 28 21. Over.
Seven, Zanzibar.
Roger. I'm sorry I was trying to get my card out. I understand 01 28 21.
Yeah.
Okay.
. . . Zanzibar.
Go ahead, Zanzibar.
All systems are green here on the ground. We get a good T/M.
Roger. Zanzibar. I'm all green here. I'm still working on the suit current circuit.
Roger. How do you feel? Uncomfortable?
I feel quite comfortable. I'm a little warm. Particularly from sunlight but other than that I feel fine.
Roger.
I am holding the suit control setting at 5.5 for a little longer.
Roger. You changed that over Kano awhile ago. Affirmative.
That's correct. Looks like you got pretty good weather down there, too.
Very good.
I've got a lot of good clouds for yaw checks. I'll say that.
Right.
Would you check your yaw reading on what you read for me in yaw at this time?
Roger. We are getting about a +5 degrees. Over.
Roger. Concur. I am trying to come back toward 0 (degrees) now.
Roger. We are pulling you right back to 0 (degrees) now.
Okay. That's the - that's the ASCS system doing it for me, of course. I'm going to have to increase the suit setting. I'm just barely breaking even. I'm going to set the suit control valve to number 6.
Roger. Understand. It's been about 10 minutes.
Roger. Thank you. The cabin is holding very well on settings, and I'm perfectly comfortable there.
Seven this is Zanzibar. We have LOS in approximately 1 minute. Anything else to report?
Nothing. I will keep the suit setting at this point until it gets a little hotter. If it does I may have to go up another half notch at about 45 (minutes), before I get to Woomera.
Roger. Understand. I would like a reading on that before we get LOS please.
Roger. My system is 6. The dome is 81, 81 (degrees).
Seven. All systems are still performing well here on the ground.
Roger.
This is Sigma Seven. Somebody broadcasting in the blind, I do not read you too well.
Seven this is Zanzibar. Read you 5 by.
Roger. You are garbled. I will give you an HF call shortly.
Roger.
Zanzibar Cap Com. In the blind. How do you read? Over.
This is Sigma Seven. I read you. It's rather . . . very garbled. I did not observe my HF antennas on turnaround. The rages were just too much smaller, I assume. I am going to switch now to VOX off and go to HF.
Canary Com Tech, Canary - correction. Zanzibar, Zanzibar this is Sigma Seven. On HF. How do you read? Over.
Hello Muchea, hello Muchea Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. HF. How do you read? Over.
This is Sigma Seven. I have noticed minute objects that I can knock off the capsule, one or two, in the bright sunlight at CET 41 10.
Seven this is Zanzibar. I barely read you HF check. Over.
Roger, Zanzibar, I read you loud and clear at this time. That is at 41 30 Zanzibar, getting HF loud and clear.
Muchea Cap Com, Muchea Cap Com. Sigma Seven HF. Over.
I am switching to push-to-talk.
Muchea Cap Com, Sigma Seven. HF check, push-to-talk. Over.
. . .
The last station that talked on HF I could not identify. It came in very clear and should be recorded aboard the capsule at approximately 43 minutes, 10 seconds elapsed time.
I have switched to VOX transmit and record. I am satisfied that I can see yaw through the window on ASCS without the use of the reticle by letting images come up from all sides. It's only a matter of a short period of time before objects show translation immediately.
The pitch scribe mark does indicate up a little bit and as a result matches the retroattitude, which at this time, is 30 degrees. I am now yawed right approximately 10 degrees, and it looks like I am tracking right down the line.
I am at 45 minutes. I am going to increase the suit setting knob just a small amount, about a quarter of a turn. I think we almost have control of the situation. I have set the suit knob at 6.25. The dome temperature at this time is 82 (degrees). Suit inlet is 76 (degrees).
I definitely can see a right roll at this time of about 5 degrees, and I noticed the periscope is dark, meaning we are coming into the dark side. I will attempt to look for the changes through the periscope for any observations. At this time, I can see nothing through the periscope for night observation, at least in this attitude. I'm not even sure when I have low mag, other than the position of the lever. The window is cloudy. I have sunlight on it now and it definitely has been clouded over by the escape tower rocket, not to a great degree. I am seeing the so-called fireflies drift dramatically at this point. I tried a couple of knocks and they definitely have a relative velocity to the vehicle, but apparently are part of the same orbital system, I definitely see them as white objects.
I would like to take some water to drink at this point, but I would rather keep the visor shut to keep the system attempting to cool down. We may make some progress on the cold side. It looks like I am going to have to decrease the cabin, it's gone down to 45 (degrees) dome. I'm coming to 3.5 on the cabin.
Checking on inverters at this time. They look very good. 150 is 102 (degrees). 250 is approximately 107 (degrees). Going back to cabin heat exchanger.
Coming into the night side now at approximately 47 minutes elapsed time. I set the cabin suit to 3.5. The suit dome is now just, correction - the cabin dome is nearing 50 (degrees) again. I will leave that setting at 3.5 for a period of time.
With this much sunlight, I cannot see stars at all. Sun is off to my left and I am getting close to sunset at approximately - 49 is the schedule time. That's just about right on. I'm approaching 49 and the cabin lights are on white. I am going to switch the cabin lights to red. And turn off that blasted lift-off correlation clock light.
Oh, I almost missed my first sunset trying to get the right cabin light off. It is rather rapid as I was told it would be. I am not able to, there I have got Arcturus right on the right side where it belongs. Very nice. I should be able to pick up Muchea shortly, at 50. Having trouble seeing the clock at 49 minutes.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, this is Muchea Cap Com. Do you read? Over.
Muchea Cap Com. Sigma Seven. HF. I read you loud and clear. Over.
Roger. You are loud and clear also. How do you feel?
I feel very good, Gene. I am on HF at this time with the dipole. The--I've readjusted the cabin setting. It--the dome went down to about 45 degrees. I set the cabin at 3.5 as the cabin coolant valve setting. Do you understand?
You set the cabin at 3.5. Is that correct?
That's right because it is reading a little low. On the suit, I am now at 6 and I am going to increase to 6.5. I am not making much progress. I went to about 6.25 about 5 minutes ago and I'm now, setting the suit control to 6.5. The dome is reading 82 [degrees].
Checked the dome temperature on the suit is 82 [degrees] and you have just now set to 6.5. Do you feel too hot or anything?
No. I have beads of perspiration on my lips. That's about all.
Can we have a suit temperature . . . ?
Say again.
Roger. Go ahead with status report. Over.
Okay. I am in auto mode at this point. Everything is acting perfectly. The maneuver switch is off. The systems are all green. I'm practically using no auto fuel. My only problem area is the suit circuit, which I am monitoring very carefully.
Roger. Sigma Seven, I'll now give you an emergency voice check. The next transmission will be on emergency voice.
Roger.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Muchea Cap Com on emergency voice. Do you read? Over.
This is Sigma Seven. Read you loud and clear Gene on emergency voice. Very good. I am setting it down at about volume level 4.
Roger.
I'll give you a blood pressure.
Roger.
Has anybody asked you yet to drink water, Sigma Seven?
Negative. I've tried not to get into that. If I can get the suit temperature down a little bit, I'll open the visor and get some water then.
Roger. Understand. Status of the Woomera flare test is okay. They are going to light them, but there is broken clouds and light rain. No lightning reported. They will fire flare.
Is the place covered with clouds? Over.
Negative. Broken clouds - the last estimate I got was 0.8 and several breaks.
Roger. Understand.
Sigma Seven, will you give us a cabin heat exchanger temperature, please. Over.
Roger. That is 41 degrees. Over.
Roger. Understand. Your body temperature readouts on the ground are not good. We are not paying any attention to your body temperature readouts. Over.
Roger. I understand.
Sigma Seven this is Muchea. What is your suit dome temperature again?
It is now holding at 82 (degrees), at a coolant setting of 6.5. Over.
Say again - being interfered with there. Will you repeat?
Roger. My dome temperature is 82 (degrees). My coolant . . . 82, number 82.
Sigma Seven. Your transmissions are now very noisy. We will stand by and not contact you for awhile. You are due to contact Woomera in about 3 minutes.
Roger.
Woomera. this is Sigma Seven. Over.
Go ahead. Sigma Seven.
Is this Muchea or Woomera?
Muchea. You are coming in much better now.
Roger. I have the moon right in the center of my field of view. It's a marvelous yaw reference. Just no sweat on it at all.
Roger. Understand. Very good yaw reference.
That's affirmative. I'm still on automatic control. I'm going to switch to fly-by-wire shortly.
Roger. We will standby and expect you to report control mode when you change to fly-by-wire low; and gyros free.
I am switching - My cabin is working okay. The suit is okay. I'm going to go down for the yaw check. Correction, for the flare check now. I'm pitching down in fly-by-wire low.
Roger. Understand.
Fly-by-wire low working very well. Trying to hold -40 (degrees in pitch). Correction, -50 (degrees).
Roger.
Setting is -50(degrees). Gyros are free. Holding at -50 (degrees). Standing by for flare. Roll and yaw are holding. I see the flare on my left which is kinda wrong, I think. I think I saw a flash of lightning. Probably - that is lightning I'm seeing, not the flare. I'm seeing more lightning. It is going to be hard to tell what I am seeing whether it's lightning or flares.
Sigma Seven this is Woomera Cap Com. Over.
Roger. Woomera. Go ahead.
This is Woomera Cap Com. Flare ignition will be in 1 minute 20 seconds.
That's one reason why I can't see it, because I am looking at lightning, obviously.
And I didn't receive your gyro switch position.
Roger. I am in fly-by-wire low and I have gyros free.
Roger.
There appears to be no trouble at all in tracking the gyros. The - there was a large problem for me in trying to get the right cabin light dimmed down to red. It's very hard to reach due to ditty bag. I have not even messed around with the camera. I don't intend to until I have the suit circuit under control.
Roger. You have 5 seconds to flare ignition.
Roger. I am tracking -50 degrees pitch.
Ignition now.
Roger. I have lightning only. It looks like you're just about socked in. I'll stay here for a while and then come back up to ASCS shortly. I think I saw lightning right below me but it couldn't have been the flare. It should burn steadily as I understand it.
Correct.
The lightning looks like a big blob, rather than a jagged streak we are use to seeing when earthbound. Just looks like a big - almost like a antiaircraft shot. A big blob of bright light, and then it fades out almost instantly. It definitely looks like you are overcast. By the way, how is my HF coming through to you all?
Clear at Woomera.
Very good. I am on HF and dipole, as you may know.
In fact, we picked you up when you began working Muchea.
You did? Very good. Well, looks like we got the poles out.
Roger.
I think I'm going to - between you and Canton, will make another attempt at the suit temperature control. We, definitely, aren't making much progress. I'm holding my own. That's all.
Roger. You're picking up a little plus yaw now.
Roger. I concur. I was looking for the flare. Are you lit now?
From heresay. Have you found it?
Roger. I've got a steady light in sight. That's because I've pitched up though. Now, it looks like we're getting much clearer weather here.
. . ..
Must have some ground lights in sight here.
Picking up some plus roll now.
Very good. I've been searching around a little bit for this. Okay, I'm going to hold that pitch still now. Holding the yaw still. Stopping roll. And I'm sorry I can't see your flare. I'm going to start pitching for ASCS.
We have 10 seconds of flare left, and Cape requests your suit temperature.
Say again.
Requesting your suit inlet temperature and dome temperature.
Roger, my suit inlet is 78 (degrees), my dome temperature is 82 (degrees).
Sigma Seven this is Woomera Cap Com. Your transmission was not received.
Roger, my suit inlet is 78 (degrees).
What is your suit and dome temperature?
This is Sigma Seven. I say again. My suit inlet temperature is 78 (degrees). My suit dome is 82 (degrees).
Okay. We got that.
Roger. I'm going to increase my setting to 7 on the coolant control on the suit. I'm now in automatic mode, gyros are normal.
Suit setting at 7.
The suit coolant valve setting is 7. That is correct.
Scanners and attitudes agree here.
Roger. I'm in orbit mode and tracking very well.
Roger. We had T/M LOS. Correction, we've got it back.
Roger. I'm going to decrease the cabin setting It's still running a little cool.
Roger.
I will set the cabin at setting number 3.
Roger. Number 3 for cabin.
I just set now, MARK,<sup>T</sup> at number 3, and the suit is riding at number 7.
Roger. And Woomera has had T/M LOS. We are standing by HF.
Roger. Am definitely see some white at this time under the overcast, and I'm sure it must be one of your major cities, possibly Brisbane. I'm not sure.
All we got was, "under the overcast", on that transmission.
It looks like a city under the overcast. I'm not sure. At about - almost right in the middle of the window at this time.
Sigma Seven, Woomera read your last transmission.
This is Sigma Seven. Going to fly-by-wire low and pitching up to reentry attitude. Selecting reentry on attitude select.
I'm now in reentry attitude. Standing by to go into automatic mode. Fly-by-wire tracks absolutely beautifully, just as it worked in the trainer. Very positive results from using the procedures trainer. There is no doubt about it, time does pass rather rapidly. Going back to automatic mode. I got pitch down signal, just a slight low thruster, and everything seems to be all right. This probably was a slight error in the corrected readout. I was right on, I believe, in all three axes. The capsule logic is working very well, and is tracking very well in reentry.
I will check my time as 1 plus 06 plus 50 seconds when I went into reentry attitude. The stars are very easy to see. I see quite a few, but am bothered by a considerable amount of red light. I, now, am going to devote some attention to the suit circuit for a minute or so. Then prepare to go back into retro attitude for Canton.
One definitely gets the illusion of looking way up above you at this attitude, and if there is no horizon, it's just a black sky. The amount of light in the cockpit is quite high. Once one gets adapted and it can be reduced, of course, by the cabin light. At this point, I am somewhat reluctant to reduce the light level in here, due to the problem with the suit circuit. I'm using my fingertip lights liberally. It is observed that in future flights, we must have some catch-all device that we can stuff objects into, and have them trapped there for a period of time. I'm driving at the problem of the washer and small crimped piece of metal. I . . . believe I finally got them stuffed into the little bag on the hatch. Suit temperature is just holding its own. I am hot, and probably will have to decrease the setting. I am sure I don't understand why the suit circuit takes so long to react. My cabin circuit works beautifully. I'm going to go back to fly-by-wire low; select retroattitude; and fly to retroattitude.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Canton Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Canton this is Sigma Seven. I read you. At this time, I am in fly-by-wire low, pitching down to retroattitude for ASCS. Over.

Canton Com Tech, Canton Com Tech. Sigma Seven. Over.
Sigma Seven this is Canton Com Tech. I read you 3 by 3. Over.
Roger. Status report. I have sent you a blood. All systems are green, but for suit circuit, which I am working on carefully. I am in ASCS retroattitude; gyros normal; maneuver off. I am working on the suit circuit. I am still holding setting number 7. Over.
Sigma Seven. Repeat, I got your status green; ASCS retro; gyros are normal; holding at 7. Repeat all others.
Roger. I am holding the suit coolant valve setting, George, at number 7. Over.
Say again. Holding suit at what and what?
The coolant valve setting is at number 7. The coolant control valve for the suit circuit.
Roger, Sigma Seven. Would you give me your standard report again. Over. This is Canton Cap Com.
Roger, Canton. You did read that I was in ASCS retro? You did read that I had my maneuver off? You did read my gyros were normal? I'd like to get the suit circuit discussed. Everything else is green.
Roger, Sigma Seven. Go ahead.
I have the suit setting for the control valve at number 7. I have the suit dome temperature of 82 (degrees). I have suit inlet of 78 (degrees). Do you understand?
Roger, Sigma Seven. I understand.
I am increasing my suit setting at this time to 7.5. Over.
Roger, Sigma Seven. Understand increasing your suit setting to 7.5. Over.
That is affirmative.
Sigma Seven. Request you push stop button on your blood pressure. Over.
I have done that. I just didn't come through right. Did that clean up the trace? Over.
Say again. Over.
Is your EKG okay now?
Roger, Sigma Seven.
Sigma Seven. How do you feel right now? Are you hot?
Not uncomfortably hot, but just a little warm. I'm trying not to take a drink of water until I can get this suit circuit under control. If I can't get it under control right away, I will be drinking some water.
Roger, Sigma Seven.
Canton Cap Com. Sigma Seven. Over.
Boy, this is a wrestling job with this ditty bag.
I'd just as soon not even go into it. Finally got one dosimeter out, and will have to put it up on the hatch and it's the - let me mark, wait one, I can't even see anything on it.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven. Hawaii Cap Com. Calling HF.
This is Sigma Seven. Sigma Seven on UHF-hi. Does anybody read? Over.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven. Hawaii Cap Com on HF.
VOX off.
This is Sigma Seven on HF. Hawaii. Do you you read? Over.
Roger. Sigma Seven. . . ..
Hawaii. You're coming in broken. I cannot read you. I'm handling HF at this time. Over.
There's Jupiter.
Guaymas Cap Com, Guaymas Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. On HF. Do you read me? Over.
Hello, Guaymas Cap Com, Guaymas Cap Com. Sigma Seven. HF. Over.
I'm now starting to see the sunrise in the periscope. First light in the periscope during this particular orbit as a result of the night side. It is obvious that the periscope has no function whatsoever in retroattitude on the night side. First light that I get is right now at a CET of practically 1 25 - 1 hour and 25 minutes. The sunrise is coming in rather rapidly through the periscope. I do have the lighted objects that John mentioned, and I can create some by knocking them off. I definitely have a sensation of their being a field and varying in size from small to bright. The periscope itself is blinding me. I'll have to put the chart on it, so I can see out the window. I am in condition for retro at anytime, so I have nothing else to do but look out this window. Assuming that the suit circuit is satisfactory. That chart helps no end to cover up that blasted periscope. Quite a large field of these objects. Definitely is confirmed that you can knock them off the hatch, as Scotty said. And they stream off at, definitely there is no problem in judging that they are going away from the capsule, at a different rate than you are. They are definitely going slower, in velocity, than the capsule itself. One rap, and you can see them sliding aft. They are too small an object for photography. I would not even attempt to take a picture of them. Retroattitude is being held very well by the ASCS. I should be able to reach Guaymas by now.
Guaymas Com Tech on HF/UHF. Do you read? Over.
Guaymas Cap Com, Guaymas Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. Over.
Guaymas Cap Com, reading you 3 by 3. Give me a quick rundown on how you feel, Wally, and suit and dome and inlet temperatures, please.
Right, Scott. I feel fine. I'm sure we're getting in on this suit circuit. The dome temperature is holding now. It's just about 81 (degrees). I'm making a change in it. The suit inlet temperature is at about 78 (degrees). I think another cut at the controls will solve this problem.
Roger. Say again your suit inlet temperature, please, and what is your control setting?
Roger. The suit inlet is 78 - 78 degrees. The setting is exactly 7.5 on the circuit control valve.
Roger.
Scott, I feel we're in very good shape for one more orbit at least, and we'll see how we can hack this suit circuit here.
Understand, Wally. We have a go. Are you ready to copy (recovery areas) 3-1 and 6-1 times?
Roger. Standby.
Okay, Scott.
Roger. 3-1 is 03 01 20.
Oh, back to 20 now.
Roger.
Okay.
6-1 is 08 51 33. Read those both back and give me a standard report, please.
Will do. Okay. 3-1 is 03 01 20. 6-1 is 08 51 33.
Right. The report, please.
Okay, stand by. I'll stow this pencil. I'm in chimp configuration. The capsule is flying beautifully. All thrusters are working well. The gyro switch is normal. Maneuver switch is off. All systems are green on green; and I'm bird-dogging the dome temperature at this time on the suit circuit.
Okay, Wally, give me your cabin dome and cabin temperature. Also, your flow control setting on cabin, too.
Okay. I have cabin temperature of 100 (degrees), cabin dome, 40 (degrees); cabin heat exchanger is 42 (degrees); the setting on the cabin is 3 and it's holding steady for a long period of time. I'd rather not change that.
Okay. And now your fuel and oxygen, please.
Okay. You want number?
Roger.
Okay. The numbers on fuel 100 (percent) for auto, 95 (percent) for manual, oxygen is 62 primary, 72 (psi, in hundreds) secondary.
Roger. And on my mark the ground elapsed time will be 1 hour, 30 minutes and 10 seconds. Standby. MARK.<sup>T</sup>.
I am exactly 1 second slow. Correction, I am 1 second fast.
Roger. Understand. One second fast, and looks like you're good for another one, Wally.
Okay. And I saw some of John's friends up here; I'm afraid to say, although I knocked them off the way you did it. Ha! Ha!
Roger. Interested in your report.
I imagine. John listening to some of that, too?
Roger.
Basically, what I saw was the firefly color that John saw, which I could create at other times as white color. I'm definitely convinced it's capsule - a capsule derivative and once in a while, even now, I see one go by.
Roger. That's good to hear.
I'm getting a very good yaw check with the yaw reticle in the ASCS mode. Having no trouble with that at all.
Wally, are the particles luminous or reflecting?
Scott, I think they are reflecting. I'm going to go ahead now, Scott, and do some yaw check as long as I've got some good terrain to look at and leave the particles off for a while.
Okay. We are just about . . . losing T/M. We're reading roughly 0, 0, and (-) 34 (degrees) at this time.
Roger. Understand.
This is Sigma Seven. I am now commencing day yaw checks. I am - Guaymas. Do you read? Over. This is Sigma Seven. I'm going to send a blood pressure at this time.
Sigma Seven, Guaymas Cap Com. Reading you on HF.
Roger. I'm going to fly-by-wire low at this time.
Roger. You're loud and clear on HF now, Wally.
Roger, Scott.
I moved my left arm too much on that last transmission. I'll give another one a little later.
Roger.
Sigma Seven, Cape Cap Com. How do you read?
Hi, Deke, I read you loud and clear. How me?
You're coming in fairly good.
This reticle is working very well for yaw, as well as for almost any other attitude.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, this is Cape Cap Com.
Go ahead, Cape.
Cape Cap Com, go ahead. Cape Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear. How me?
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, Cape Cap Com.
This is Sigma Seven. Go ahead, Cape, I read you loud and clear.
You are coming in about 3 by.
Okay.
I'm okay. Standby, I'm going back to ASCS. It's gotta hold me up (delay me.) The capsule - I'd like to straighten out this problem that you are - obviously have seen on the suit circuit. I have had very little luck in bringing it down. I'm going to increase the setting to 8 at this time. I am on 8 now - the suit dome is now about 81 (degrees). It has dropped about a degree. Do you understand?
Understand suit dome is 81 (degrees). .
That is correct. Suit dome is 81(degrees). The suit inlet is about 76(degrees). I'm making a little ground on it.
That sounds promising.
Yeah, I think it is. I didn't want to rush into it, and I didn't get too hot. I know you are concerned. I'd rather come up on the right setting than dicker around going back and forth.
Roger.
Now all the systems are working very well. I'd like to give you a rundown on the control systems. My fly-by-wire is excellent. Manual was slightly sluggish but very good. The capsule at this time is in auto mode, maneuver off, gyros normal. T<sub>s</sub>+5 did check out very well. The fuel is holding up as you can see, as well as the oxygen.
Okay, sounds good.
Okay. I'm going to continue with my day yaw checks now.
Next transmission will be on emergency voice.
Roger.
Sigma Seven, Cape Cap Com, transmitting emergency voice. Over.
Roger. I read you loud and clear. I'm going to send you another ...(blood pressure) here, because I moved too much on the last one.
Roger.
Seven, Cap Com.
Go ahead, Deke.
Your (contingency recovery area)2 Bravo retro.
Standby 'till I finish my blood here. Okay, I'm done. Okay, go ahead with your 2 Bravo.
2 Bravo, 01 48 32.
48 32. Is that correct?
01 48 32.
32 Roger. Understand. 01 48 32, 2 Bravo.
We suggest you have a drink of water if you haven't had one recently.
No, I haven't. I've tried not to open the visor. I want to get the circuit going down. I think we might have a chance to take a quick one. I'll get ready for one.
Okay. If you're reading this, I want to clear you on one item.
Okay.
You indicated high thruster action at Bermuda and Muchea on switch over from ASCS to fly-by-wire. Has this been apparent to you?
Negative. It has not. I have one case where I went into reeentry attitude after - correction, before - Canton but this was to check the stars at night after Woomera. And I got a twitch then, which I think was a high thruster.
Otherwise, it dropped in beautifully on transition from control mode to control mode.
You're pretty poor transmitting, let's try UHF once.
Okay. Standby, VOX off.
Seven, Cap Com, UHF. How do you read?
Deke. I read you loud and clear. How me?
How you reading now?
I read you fine. I just had some water and it does feel kinda good.
Roger, loud and clear.
Say again.
Looks more readable on UHF.
Okay. We'll use that around the pad.
Have some Echo sighting data for you if you're interested.
Yeah, I'd like to hear about it.
In the second orbit over Zanzibar, time 15 23 Zulu. Azimuth should be 2.30 (degrees), elevation 83.25 (degrees).
Roger, we'll see if we can take a peek at it.
Our recommendation is that you decrease suit valve to position 3 and observe dome temperature for 15 minutes. If this doesn't help, then go back to 7.
Deke, I finally got a grasp on this thing. I'm beginning to feel a little cooler. And the suit inlet temperature is now down to 76 (degrees). Over.
Roger, understand you would prefer to maintain a status quo, is that correct?
No, I've been sneaking up on this thing for almost a whole orbit.
Roger.
Do you understand?
Roger.
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven.
Go ahead.
I really do feel I am getting cooler. The suit inlet is now about 75 to 76 (degrees), so I am making progress. Over.
Roger, understand. You are getting a slight decrease.
That is affirmative. I would rather not throw in the sponge on the settings I have so far.
Roger, understand. You would prefer to let it stabilize a while longer.
Right. I'm going to go back to some more yaw checks.
Going to fly-by-wire low.
Fly-by-wire low.
Roger.
Sigma Seven, Cap Com.
Go ahead, Deke.
Bermuda again shows high thruster action on switch over to fly-by-wire.
I'm positive I'm not getting it, because if - I'd be leaping all over - I'd be leaping all over the sky if I were getting highs at this point. I haven't used more than, oh, 1/2 degree per second.
Sigma Seven, Cap Com.
Go ahead Deke.
Go ahead Cape Cap Com.
Roger, you are fading. We are about at LOS. Flight would still prefer that you consider going to position 3 after evaluating 8 a while longer.
Roger. Understand.
Roger. I'm now getting into attitude. Standby for 0 (degrees) yaw, and pitch and roll. This will be - .
Yaw is now approximately 0 at this time - MARK. <sup>T</sup>. I will look - about 4 degrees left. Correcting in pitch, yaw is okay, going to go back to ASCS to get gyros straightened out, gyros are normal at this time. I'm setting up into the tight pattern.
Rates are just about right on, attitudes right on, going to fly-by-wire, gyros normal. At 1 44 50 approximately, we are back into chimp configuration. Understand I will have LOS at Bermuda; next station is Canaries. At this point suit temperature is now down to 75 (degrees), dome is still high.
On the 0 - on the 0 to 50 - on the 0 to 50 Roentgen Scale at 01 hour 46 minutes, there is practically no reading at all.
Sigma Seven this is Canary Com Tech, transmitting UHF/HF. Do you read? Over.
Hello, Canary Com Tech, this is Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Roger, Sigma Seven, this is Canary Cap Com, reading you loud and clear. We'd like to get some temperature readings from you. Cabin suit and cabin dome and suit dome. Over.
Okay, I'll give you a readout. Suit dome is 80 (degrees), suit inlet temperature is 75 (degrees), cabin dome is 41 (degrees), cabin temperature is 97 (degrees), suit coolant setting is 8, cabin is 3. I will follow . . ..
Do you feel that these settings now are giving you adequate cooling.
I am going to take Flight's suggestion, and reduce my setting to unit 3 for a few minutes, and then try back at 7 if this does not work. Over.
Roger. I copied.
I am now going to setting number 3 on the suit temperature control.
Roger.
At 1 hour and 50 minutes.
Roger. What is your present control mode?
I am in ASCS.I have completed yaw checks with the window, I am going to try some yaw checks with the periscope at this time.
Roger.
Switching to fly-by-wire low, gyros free.
I can definitely see a yaw pattern in the window, in the periscope, in the reticle. The window itself is satisfactory at (-) 34 degrees, I've covered the gyro and am now coming back to the left to remove yaw.
Roger. Did you, how far did you have to come back on yaw?
I am not there yet. I'd say about 25 to 30 degrees, I'm stopping yaw at this time. The periscope checks with the window and the reticle and I'm going to give a mark shortly, to try to get all the rates stopped. I am just about in retroattitude now, and yaw looks real clean. I'm going to pull off and look. It's about 1 degree of yaw, to the right - MARK.<sup>T</sup>. Okay, I'm satisfied with that kind of day yaw check. That was done in retroattitude. I had a real good cloud layer, that was what was the cue.
Roger. How do you feel about systems at the present time now?
All systems are green except for the suit cooling and it definitely is - the dome temperature is going up at this time. I'm going to go back on ASCS for a while and hack out a network.
Roger.
I will not go to ASCS. Ah, by the way, how about taking a look at my high thrusters. Have you seen any high thruster action at all?
Standby.
I shouldn't have had any at all.
Wally, did you already switch to ASCS?
Negative. I have not switched.
Do it now.
Say again.
Go ahead and switch.
I'm going - have I had any high thruster action so far?
Negative.
Okay, that's good. I'm still in fly-by-wire low, standby switching now, flop. I'm going - .
Say again.
No high thrusters.
Okay, good deal going, gyros normal.
Roger, that is affirmative.
I have completed my day yaw checks. I am very satisfied with the technique of taking care of roll as I . . .
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is . . .. Do you read? Over.
This is Sigma Seven. I had to give up on this lower temperature. Everything's going up.
Okay, I'll report that to the Cape.

Okay. I've set it back to 7.5.
Roger. I copied 7.5.
The suit dome went up to 82 degrees.

Hello, Kano Cap Com. Sigma Seven. Over.
Roger, Sigma Seven. I have not read your transmissions. Over.
Roger. I had to switch to HF at this time, and am in VOX at this time. HF. How do you read?
Negative, Seven. Would you say again?
I'm on VOX - correct, I am going to push-to-talk on HF. Do you read me now?
Roger. I read you better now.
Okay. Do you want some suit stuff?
Roger. How is your suit doing?
Okay. I've already caught the dome temperature. Went up to about 82 (degrees). I've got it back to 81 (degrees). The suit inlet went up to 80 (degrees). I've got it back to 78 (degrees). I am back at the setting of almost 7.5 on the suit set selector. I'm going to setting number 8 at this time.
Understand. You are going to number 8 on suit setting.
That is correct.
Would you say again your suit temperature.
Suit temperature at this time is dropping slowly. It is now 77 (degrees).
You're rising?
Negative. It is dropping - lowering.
What is your dome temperature?
It is coming down. It is now 81, 81 (degrees).
Roger, I copied.
Okay, I think we got locks on it by going higher in settings.
Say again. You were garbled.
I think we have the situation under control.
I am now in ASCS, gyros normal, maneuver off, all systems green. I am green.
Roger. Understand. Auto retro.
That is affirmative.
Our telemetry shows pitch attitude of 25 (degrees) negative and our scanner shows 36 (degrees) negative.
Roger, your scanner is correct. I am indicating 36 (degrees) negative that it checks with the window.

Would you say it back to me.
Roger. 02 04 30.
That is Roger.
How is your suit temperature now, Seven?
It is now coming down to about 76 (degrees) and the dome is 80 (degrees). We're going in the right direction.
Is your cabin temperature holding?
Cabin temperature is under control. It is 95 (degrees). 95.
Roger.
How do you feel?
I feel very comfortable now. I'm cooling off at last.
Very good.
I am going to manual proportional at this time.
Are you going to power down?
Negative, this is manual proportional.

This is Sigma Seven. I feel marvelous and I have finally knocked suit control.
This is Sigma Seven. I had a slight case of double authority here. I got very bored with manual proportional during the drifting period and forgot to put the rate command switch to auto, . . .it's about one stroke in pitch.

IOS, this is Sigma Seven. I'm not sure whether you realize but I have been in auto mode retroattitude. Over.
At last we have solved the suit circuit temperature problem. I can see why Scott was concerned about this record position only. There is no side tone as well. The suit temperature at this time is - CET 2 17 20 MARK.<sup>T</sup> - is 68 degrees and I'm feeling marvelous. The suit dome is about 72 degrees again. Apparently, it does fluctuate, and we are going into the night side at this time. I believe we have the suit circuit under good control. I will go back to VOX push-to-talk. Standing by for Muchea at 25 (minutes). Gotta watch one sunset.
Sunset is rather striking, I don't think that I need to waste much time looking at them. They are very interesting. The other thing, it's fascinating is how black it is when your eyes are not adapted. I definitely can see some coating on the window. Going back to VOX at this point in UHF-hi to transmit. Opening visor to wipe off the right microphone. I licked it. Closing visor. Visor was sealed immediately for the suit circuit to go to work for me. I don't want to get fouled up with it again. The suit inlet is holding very nicely at about 68 (degrees). So the dome again is going to go back up. It's now up at 76, 75 (degrees). Apparently this higher setting is the one we want. Think I'll put in another half a mark on that now and we may have her locked. She's getting kinda cool at last so I know where I want to go with the setting. I have set the coolant quantity for the suit and control lever at 8.5 at 2 hours 19 minutes, 28 seconds. The readout the dome at this time is 75 (degrees). The suit inlet is 68 (degrees). Very pleasant. I can feel cool air crossing my face. The oxygen quantity looks real good, 60 and 75 (psi, in hundreds). I have been watching the 250 inverter. It is approaching 140 degrees, and the 150 contrast is down to about 100 degrees. Standby is about 100 (degrees) which is cabin temperature. Thirdly, the 250 - that one's suffering, and I will keep an eye on it. Cabin heat exchanger is definitely settling out at 40 degrees, and its given me a hard time because I obviously owe Frank Samonski 50 cents. I'm pleasantly surprised. Cabin fuel too, is reading a little high. Let me see now, we're carrying 5.5 psi. it's reading about 5 point, correction, 5.3, that's not too high for this cabin. It's getting nice and dark out, I think I'll take a peek out at the stars at this point. The cover for the battery for the flashlight on the left glove is coming loose. Only where - where the switch is, is no problem, just a case of wearing out before they should. Drifting, checking my wrist watch as a backup and I have 2 hours and 51 minutes. Correction, that's 2 hours and 21 minutes. Check that, 2 hours and 21 minutes and 35 seconds. Right on. We're not too bad, we better get a CET check at Muchea on this trip.
Going for the computer. Clock is reading about 2 hours and 23 minutes. We'll say 2 24. At 2 24 we should pick up Muchea, also pick up a yaw check. 2 24 we have 05 36 on the other set.
Perth should be coming into view and it should be - oh, what a beautiful yaw check this is, and it's approximately 10 degrees left of path. Better make that about 12 degrees left to path. Just on the edge of the window, and that should give us 0 (degrees) yaw. I cannot see anything through the periscope that would help me. It is too - it is too cloudy. I'm coming out on VOX 1, 2, 1, 2. VOX is now coming in very well.
Sigma Seven Sigma Seven this is Muchea Cap Com. How do you read? Over.
Muchea, this is Sigma Seven. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Read you loud and clear, also, Wally. How about a standard report.
Okay, Gene, I'll give you the suit thing first so everybody is off the hook. We have a dome on the suit of 72, that is dome temperature (degrees). I have a suit inlet of 66 (degrees) on the suit and the suit setting is 8 and I am very happy with the suit circuit at this time. I am very comfortable.
Roger. Cape advises they are very happy with the whole situation at this time. Particularly, the ECS systems solved itself, and they seem to think you have a good handle on the whole situation there.
Roger, I lost it for a while when I went back to the 3 setting, but I didn't stay there very long. It definitely should be about 7-1/2 to 8. At this point, I am on ASCS auto retroattitude. I am going to go to fly-by-wire shortly. I had been on gyros normal, and maneuver has been off. All systems are green. I snapped off about 2 percent of manual (fuel) one time by hitting RSCS. It was double authority. It was my boo-boo. It was just one pitch down motion.
Roger. Understand and stand by.
Okay, I would like to go ahead with my night yaw check on fly-by-wire low.
Roger. We'll stand by.
Okay. Now I'm using the moon which is to the left of me, and it's a real good fix for it. I'm just gonna go ahead and cover up the attitude indicator and you can watch the yaw. I'm going to gyros free, trying to select to fly-by-wire low at this time. I'm gonna put the moon in the center of the window first - and holding roll and pitch and then put the moon back where it belongs. The moon is approaching the center of the window at this point. Okay, I'm gonna stop it there, and we'll put the roll control in to get that balanced out. Okay, at this point, I will get 0 roll. I have overshot the moon and am picking up the planet Mercury which is nice and bright, and that's a little bit far to the right. Now take a check off and we'll see how many degrees we've got here in yaw. About 20, which is enough for a quantitative check. We'll bring her back now. And I have to go ahead with slight roll motion each time I do this. This is to track the horizon naturally.
Roger. Understand.
Okay, we're coming to the right as you may be able to see, and we're coming around very well. I still have to correct my roll out. Coming up on yaw attitude very shortly here. I'm quite satisfied with both day and night checks. I've been real pleased with it. I have to say this has been a real treat to see these bears flow into place.
Roger, everything checks out just as you say on the ground indication, Wally.
Okay, I'm gonna give you a mark on the moon now for a yaw reference. I would say this is now zero yaw. MARK.<sup>T</sup>.
Fine. We had a -4 on the ground. That's pretty good.
-4. Okay, I'll check here. Looks about right. I could have come right a little bit more. Okay, that's about all I need for the night yaw checks, and, as far as I'm concerned, I'll go back and give the guys some more ASCS time. I don't see any reason to burn up too much fuel. Now I'll give one you one of those things for your Sir John.
Roger. Understand. There's a few lights on at . . .. Can you see anything?
We seem to be getting reasonable body temperatures now, Wal.
Oh, very good. Warren, nice to hear from you, old man.
Me too. How are you, Sand Groper?
Oh, great sport. Understand some suds are on the way back.
I might as well look down and see if you fellows have got some lights on. I'm gonna kill the blood pressure.
Shannon runs out of fuel, . . . he doesn't get bogged down in the sand.
Ha! Ha! I still have black skid marks on my swim fins from your trip into the bush. Okay, you can see I've yawed right again. I need to come - correction, yawed left. I need to come right, the moon is right on the horizon. I'll put it right on again, just to show you how easy it is to acquire. I seem to be holding up on my fuel minimum so I'll go ahead and play with it a little bit here. Okay, we're just about on in yaw, and still off in roll. I'll slap her in and we'll have it made. Here comes roll to straighten her up. Coming up on roll - okay, I'm quitting right there. That's about as good as I'll ever give you. Little off in roll here. There we go. Now, that's what I would give you. Okay, I'm gonna go back to gyros normal, and let them come back on the line. I'm going to set up now and uncover the instruments for chimpanzee configurations. Dammit, I'm sorry, auto mode.
Roger. I understand.
I broke my promise.
We had you on a +5 (degree) roll when you uncovered.
Right, that's about right. Oh! I've got some lights down there. How about that?
Good, that's us.
That's a great deal. Sure thank you-all. I've got a washer in here. I captured a washer and a little piece of metal and this looks like sort of a conical washer like a Voishan type or something, better not be.
Fine - can you give us another blood pressure. That one cut off a little too soon.
Okay, let me get back into configuration here. I'm going to ASCS at this time. And she walked in without any high thrusters, I believe. Will you double check that? And for that, I'll give you a blood pressure.
Roger.
Got to check the Sanborn I guess, for that one. Coming up on BPMS. Gene, I'm real pleased with the suit temperature now. I've got a real steady 65 (degrees). Although the dome is reading just about 70 (degrees) as a steady number.
Roger. 65 and dome 70.
Right. The cabin is just sitting here fat, dumb, and happy, I haven't had to do a thing to it. Now, have you been watching my 250 inverter?
I've got 55 (degrees) on the ground.
I've got 140 (degrees) here. And the trend has been very slow building up. I don't think I'll change the cold plate settings. The 150 is holding about . . ..
This is Muchea - recommend you go over to Woomera.
Roger. Woomera Cap Com, Sigma Seven. Over.
Sigma Seven, Woomera Cap Com. Loud and clear. Over.
Roger. Nice to be back over Woomera.
Same here. And . . ..
I'm a little bit . . ..
. . . mode.
Okay.
. . . condition.
Roger. I am in ASCS auto, in other words a normal mode. Gyros are normal, maneuver is off, all systems are green. I'm real happy with the suit circuit at this time.
Roger. We received your last reports from Muchea and is that auto retro?
That is auto retro. Would you give me a time hack at 33 minutes. Over. That's 2 hours, 33 minutes.
You want to get your blood pressure stopped?
Roger. Can you read me?
Affirmative, we are reading you.
I need a mark on capsule elapsed time. Your ground elapsed time, give it to me at 30 seconds.
Roger.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1. MARK [tim:00:02:33:30|02 33 30].<sup>T</sup>
Roger. I read 31. I'm 1 second fast. That's very good.
Your T/M readout on your capsule elapsed time occasionally reads out 1 second fast and then comes out to be correct with our time, then it gains a second again.
Welcome to the Quiver Club.
Roger.
Okay, I think I gave you some good old blood for that one. Thanks for the swap.
Roger, that was the stop button. The stop button, we're still getting it.
Okay, I'll stop her.
Roger.
I'll try to give you the full bit.
Thanks.
You were so nice asking for it. I had to give it to you.
We meant the stop button.
Oh, for gosh sakes, I gave you a whole new one.
Ha! Ha! It never quit.
I see.
Looks good now.
Good show. Okay, I feel happy about the fuel condition. We've got - I'm reading 95 (percent) auto, 90 (percent) manual. What are you reading?
Reading 98 auto and manual 94.
Well, how about that.
Beautiful.
Okay, Spacecraft Commander, this is Woomera Systems. Do you have any high thruster actions during your last pass over Woomera and Muchea?
I don't think so, because I was just cruising over you that time in fly-by-wire low and ASCS. I had one . . ..
Z Cal jumped down here and indicated high thrust. We think that was probably erroneous.
I'm quite sure it was, because I would have noted it rather rapidly. I made one large thrust application in the flight so far, where I was going back from manual proportional to fly-by-wire and I forgot to move the rate command switch to auto. I had one pitch function and you really know it. So if I had a high thruster, I'm sure I would have known it.
Roger.
Very good. Thanks for looking out for me.
Everything looks green down here.
Oh, it's great up here.
Standing by.
Righto. I'm seeing a lot of your lightning now.
Yeah, we got a bunch.
I'll bet you have. Sorry I couldn't see your flare just - I thought I saw, but it's just lightning all the time.
Maybe next time.
Okay. I see Africa. Looks pretty good down there. We'll give them a whack at it. Don't give up though, I think the flare will help us some day.
We'll let Gordo take a look at it.
Right. I'm gonna do a little star gazing now.
Woomera has T/M LOS.
Roger, Woomera.
Sigma Seven, Woomera.
Go ahead, Woomera.
There's the old Corona Australis, shows in beautifully, and we've got Nunki. We've got Kaus Australis, and Nunki is right on the flight path where it belongs. I'm reading 0 yaw, 5 degrees left roll, in retroattitude. I sure would like to know why it's so complicated. And up above those boys I should pick up another brighty. That must be, has to be Altair. Very good. You actually get the feeling that you aren't really going over Australia on this flight. Okay. Now let's see, we finished yaw check for those boys, coming up on Canton. They get more ASCS than they reckoned for this time.
That's right, on HF at 3 plus 20, everything else is in order. Take another look at that dome there, over there. Suit temperature is 64 (degrees) and I'm really happy.
T<sub>r</sub>-10 back to normal. I've done that earlier. Okay, we got - got suit pressure. Go ahead and take a look at the inverters again here. 250 is 141 (degrees), 150 is about 107 (degrees). Well enough alone. Standby is . . . 7. Just about ambient. Negative, it's even a little . . .. The cabin pressure is about 5.3 (psi), which is perfect. Suit dome is 72 (degrees). Cabin dome is 45 (degrees) and cabin is holding. Suit temperature is about 64 (degrees) and I like it. Oxygen is 60 (psi, in hundreds). Cabin O<sub>2</sub> is 5.3 (psi), and a complete electrical.
All batteries are reading about 23½ (volts) or higher, ammeter is just about steady at 20 amps. Wanted to check before we power down, ASCS is 115 (volts). Fans is about 115 (volts), standby 0 (volts). Okay, the cockpit is clean. It's obvious that that damn antenna situation is no good. Just brought HF back in bicone again.
Sigma Seven Sigma Seven, this is Canton Com Tech. Over.
This is Sigma Seven, I read you loud and clear. How me?
Okay, we're back in dipole.
Seven, Canton Com Tech, how do you copy?
Canton is coming in early. No, he's coming in about on time.
Canton Com Tech, this is Sigma Seven. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Sigma Seven Sigma Seven. This is Canton Com Tech, Canton Com Tech. How do you copy? Over.
Canton Com Tech, this is Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Sigma Seven Sigma Seven this is Canton Com Tech, Canton Com Tech on HF. Over.
Canton Com Tech this is Sigma Seven. How do you read me? Over.
Sigma Seven Sigma Seven this is Canton Com Tech on HF/UHF. Over.
Sigma Seven Sigma Seven, this is Canton Com Tech, Canton Com Tech, how do you copy? Over,
Canton Com Tech, this is Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear. How me?
Sigma Seven, Canton Com Tech. I read you 5 by. Over to Cap Com. Over.
Roger, I'm here too.
Sigma 7 this is Canton Cap Com. Over.
Roger, Canton. All right I'll give you a short report. I am in auto retro mode, gyros normal, maneuver off, all systems are green, suit circuit is under positive control.
Roger, Can - Roger, Sigma Seven.
This is Sigma Seven. I am ready at this time for a retrosequence if required. All I have out is one star chart and that's it.
Roger, Sigma Seven.
And you'd better not give me one. Ha, Ha, Ha.
Say again, Sigma Seven.
I don't want one. Ha. Ha.
Roger.
She is really performing like a jewel right now.
Say again, Sigma Seven.
I said she is performing like a little jewel.
Roger, that's great.
Now, the only thing we had trouble with so far is the suit circuit, and we've got that pretty well licked.
That's what I understand from listening over the Goddard conference (network communications loop).
Now, just for your briefing, I've got a suit inlet (temperature) now of about 63 degrees, and the dome is holding steady, at 70 degrees.
Roger, understand.
I'm perfectly comfortable. I'm gonna quit with that thing while I'm ahead.
Roger.
Some of that reason that I've lost HF communications, I believe, is that I keep bumping that switch from dipole to bicone. You understand?
You say you keep bumping the switch from dipole to bicone?
That is correct. So on the HF check here, I'm set up for it. I think we can probably get a good one this time.
Roger.
That's at 3 hours and 20 minutes, of course. Apparently I've got to keep checking that thing for bicone. Correction - for dipole.
Roger, understand.
I just have to move my elbow to the right, and I knock it.
I see.
It's not critical. It's just a way of doing business. I had compared the night yaw checks over Muchea and Woomera, and am very satisfied with the results. With known objects it is absolutely no problem at all to acquire yaw. In addition, we can watch . . . down through the window.
Roger, that's what I heard. I heard your report at Woomera.
Roger. There is nothing new up here, then.
Roger. We have nothing. No questions here.
Roger. Apparently, the 250 inverter is not going up very much. My reading is still remaining about 140 degrees.
Roger.
I guess Frank Samonski knows I owe him a half a dollar by now.
Roger.
For your information, because you can't read it, my retro (package) temperature at this time is 72 degrees.
Roger. Understand 72 degrees.
That is correct.
Thank you. Seventy-two degrees.
Seventy-two degrees for the retro heater. Retro rocket rather. There are no heaters.
I'm opening the visor just for a moment to scratch my nose.
Roger.
And closing visor. I missed on that, I'm gonna have to reseal that. Okay, it's re-sealed. I'd just as soon not stay on that cabin any longer than necessary.
Roger.
Sigma Seven, Hawaii Com Tech. How do you read? Over.
Hello, Hawaii Com Tech. I read you loud and clear. How me?
Hawaii Com Tech. This is Sigma Seven, read you loud and clear. How me? Over.
Sigma Seven, Hawaii Cap Com.
Hi, Gussie, how ya' doin'.
Sigma Seven, Hawaii Com Tech.
Hawaii Com Tech, Hawaii Cap Com, this is Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear. How me?
Sigma Seven, this is Hawaii Cap Com. How do you read?
I read you loud and clear.
Hawaii Cap Com, I will start a standard report for you. I am in auto retroattitude. I have gyros normal, maneuver off, all systems are green, and go for the next orbit. Over.
Roger, Wally. Understand all systems are green and go. We indicate you have a go down here.
Roger.
Could you give me a CET, please?
Roger. Standby for a mark at 50. MARK 50. <sup>T</sup>. That's 2 hours 50 minutes plus 50 seconds.
Roger. We indicate you're 1 second fast.
Roger, Gus. I think everybody's got the reading on the suit circuit, I won't bother bringing that up anymore.
Roger. I'd like to have a cabin temperature and a cabin dome temperature.
Okay. Cabin temperature is 97 (degrees). The dome is 45 (degrees).
Say again dome temperature.
45.
Roger. 45.
And the setting has not been changed for a long time.
Roger.
I have not changed the setting on the inverters. I'll give you a recap on those. Inverters are at 4. That's the (coolant control) valve setting. The cabin is at 3. The suit is at 8.
Roger.
And it's working all very fine. I've got about 62 (degrees) inlet now on the suit.
Would you push your blood pressure stop button, Wally?
Roger.
Now you don't have to ask me for it, you have to tell me to stop. This is horrible. Ha!
I'd rather ask you to give it.
I liked your dispatch the other day. It helped.
I almost forgot. Aloha, from Hawaii.
Oh! Aloha.
Got some real good night yaw checks, Gus. It just slops right in.
Roger.
And, your reports on manual proportional, just about right. The tail-off is what you see more than anything else. It's a little sluggish.
Wally, Cape seems to think you're in good shape also.
Roger. I feel fine. This old bird is really performing up here.
Good show.
Wally, give me a reading on your attitudes now.
Okay, I am rolled left about 7 degrees. Yaw right 2 degrees. Pitched up about 4 degrees.
Roger. Pitch up 4 degrees.
That's affirmative.
Roger.
We have a ± 5½ degree envelope on this one, Gus.
Roger.
She's tracking beautifully. I haven't had a thruster one problem. Really nice.
Roger. Give me your pitch attitude again, Wally. We don't agree with that.
Okay, I have an indicated (-) 30 degree pitch, and it checks with the window just about right on the button, Gus.
Okay, Roger. I misread you then.
I'm sorry I said + 4, I was going up from the retro mark which would probably confuse you.
Yes, you did,
I can imagine.
Okay, I'll read them out the way I see them instead of the way the SEDR (Service Engineering Department Report) boys do it. I'm getting the old fireflies again. I guess John is relieved. I haven't been looking for them - they're just there.
Okay.
They're just freebees. You can see some big ones and some little ones. They're almost impossible to photograph. Most of them are of a less magnitude than I'd say a good star. Every once in a while you see some of the big ones.
Do you see them close to you?
Oh, yeah, you can actually see relative motion, Gus. You can see them right by the window, then have them drifting way away. Looks like you see them way out because the velocity between you and fireflies is definite.
Roger. Wally, I think we're losing you. Will you stand by for California?
Okay, Gus. I want to talk about this to John. He's the one that's been waiting. I guess we're gonna have them all the time.
Sunrise over the West Coast. It is rather disappointing because it is just about socked in completely; smog and cloud conditions. I am seeing breaks as I approach the coast line. Someday, I'll get a flight across the Pacific without clouds underneath me.
The attitudes check out very well. No doubt about it. Yaw can be seen with the periscope. And it can be acquired very rapidly. It can also be seen through the window without any device.
Covering up the periscope again. Standing by for John.
Hello Sigma Seven, Cal Cap Com. Do you receive? Over.
Hi, there John. I read you loud and clear. How me?
Hello Sigma Seven, Cal Cap Com. Do you read?
Cal Cap Com, Sigma Seven. Loud and clear. How me?
Roger, loud and clear, Wally. Looks like things are leveling off pretty good up there. Looks like it's going fine now. You got a status report?
Yes sir. I'm real happy with this bird. I am in ASCS auto mode, retro attitude, I have gyros normal, maneuver off, all systems are green. I've got the suit circuit under control as you probably know by now, and a delightful report for one John Glenn. I do see fireflies.
Good boy.
And they were your color, John. That was a very good description. Although during the bright side, if I rap them, they're definitely white. While on the sun center sunrise, they come out the true firefly color you described.
John, did you read all that?
This is Cal. Now reading you very weak, Wally. You faded after that first good transmission there. I got that you were seeing the fireflies and then you faded out on your description. Repeat please.
Okay. How do you read me now?
Loud and clear again.
Okay, we're back on UHF-hi. They were definitely the fireflies that you described at sunrise. I haven't been looking at sunsets particularly. As we get brighter, for example, now when I'm in the daylight and I rap it, I get white crystals which look like ice.
Roger, got that all okay. Understand as described at first, and they got whiter as you go into better light.
Right, I've got white ones right now that are sort of drifting around. Look like little bits of frost.
Roger, sounds good. Are you read to copy (recovery area) 4-1 retrosequence? Over.
Roger, go ahead John.
Roger. Incidentally, you have a go for the next orbit in case you were wondering. Cape concurs with that one. Your retrosequence time for 4-1 is 04 32 36. Over.
32 36.
Roger. 04 32 36. And Cape advises just proceed with normal flight plan. Looks like things are going fine.
Yeah, I feel real happy with everything. I stopped everything to get a hold of that suit circuit and that seemed to fix it up.
Roger, that had everybody concerned for a while, but looks like it is in good shape now.
I was sure everybody was jumping up and down on that one.
You were right.
It's kind of hard to describe all this, isn't it John?
Yeah, it sure is, Wally. Can't describe it.
No, - real, real thrill.
Too bad you're all socked in.I hope to see you pretty soon though.
Haven't even looked outside.
Ha, Ha, Ha. That was my problem when you were going over.
I guess you heard my yaw reticle is working out very well.
Yeah, that's real good. Glad to hear it.
I definitely did detect some fogging on the window from the tower rocket, John.
Roger, got that. Some fogging on the window from the rocket.
Yeah.
I'm gonna try your idea on pitch technique here for drifting. I think that'll be fun.
Say again, Wally, didn't get it.
I'11 try your technique on the drifting period for this orbit by using - I think that will be a lot of fun. I just had a hole out here with an island. Looks like that might have been San Clemente, I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm over land now.
Roger.
I'm getting a good sight of the U.S.A. We just got the typical California fog belt behind me and looks like I'm getting a watch at the Salton Sea, I believe.
Roger. That's where Scott and I both picked up loud and clear over here. Seems to be always clear back in there.
Yeah, just as soon as you get over the ridge line.
I don't see anybody water skiing today. Is it cold?
Not that cold.
Ha, Ha, Ha.
That's about as far north as I can see is the Salton Sea. You get a real good look at Baja California. And I probably can see Guaymas loud and clear, the way it seems.
Looks like you have pretty good visibility today, if you see all that area.
Yeah, I can see just about as far as the Salton Sea north. I can see the Mt. Whitney area, but not much of it for the snow capped peaks that are just about on the horizon now.
Right.
And I can see with a little craning, around almost the southern tip of the Baja peninsula.
Sounds like you've got a real good view today with not much cloud cover up there over a lot of it.
No, just the coast is all that's socked in. The rest of it's CAVU (clear and visibility unlimited). As long as I get some ASCS time I can look. I've got some roads down here that are pretty obvious to me right on the flight path. I'm really talking to you for a long way, John.
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven.
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven.
Muchea Com, correction - Guaymas, Sigma Seven.
Roger. Go ahead Sigma Seven.
Okay, Scott, things are going real well up here. Gonna get a grip on that coolant system, and your comment was very valid. If a guy has time, he can usually work it out.
Roger, Wally, you faded out at the last. Understand everything is good up there, you have another good trip.
Right, I think I had a good look at your station going over.
Roger, understand.
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven. Over.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven. Cape Cap Com.
Roger, Deke. I'm on push-to-talk at this time. How do you read? Over.
Roger. Reading you 5 by.
Roger, this is UHF-hi.
Roger.
Going to VOX.
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven. On VOX
Roger. You're good on VOX.
Okay. I'm sending you one. Control mode is ASCS; auto retro; gyros normal; maneuver off. All systems are green. I'll give you a readout on the domes here, if you'd like.
Cape Cap Com. Sigma Seven.
Sigma Seven. Cape Cap Com.
Did you read the report?
I read the report. Awaiting the dome temperature particularly suit.
Okay. Suit dome is 70 (degrees). Cabin dome is 45 (degrees). That blasted cabin heat exchanger is 40 (degrees). Suit inlet is 62 (degrees), and I'm very comfortable.
Excellent.
Are you ready for me to make a power down yet?
Very good. Would you give us all three inverter temperatures at your leisure.
Okay. I'll give you those, and then I'll power down.
Roger.
250 is 143 (degrees). It's gone up about 2 degrees in the last 40 minutes. The 150 is about 105 (degrees). The standby is about, ha, 110 (degrees) I'd say. A little warmer.
Roger.
And the retro heaters, the retropackage temperature is about 74 (degrees), and it's stayed there almost all this time.
Roger. That's very good.
Okay. I'm gonna go into a power down.
Roger. Understand.
I'll give a readout on how I do it. Selecting fly-by-wire. Going to gyros caged. Judging gyros caged. I'm going to 0.
Roger.
Going to ASCS bus, turning it off, and that's 0 volts. And am I clear to kill my beacon?
Affirmative.
Okay. Beacon off. The rates are . . ..
Hit your blood pressure stop button, we're still getting BP.
Yeah, instead of getting asked for it, I'm gotta asked to stop it now.
That's a welcome changeover.
There go the beacons off.
Roger.
I caught your Z Cal. Okay, the rates are nice and zeroing. I'm going back to normal position instead of fly-by-wire.
Roger.
Gyros are caged, and the VOX is off. I'm going to select reentry for the attitude, so I got that set up for the powering-up procedure.
Very good.
Okay, I've got fly-by-wire low, and the normal on the ASCS mode, auto, gyros caged, maneuver is still off. And the bea - and the beacons are off. Here she's cruising along very happily.
Very good. Are you ready for a (contingency recovery area) 3-C retro (time)?
Say again.
Are you ready for your 3-C retro time?
I'm sorry. You're very garbled.
Are you ready for your 3 Charlie retro time?
Okay. I'll try to get it from you, Deke. I - you're garbled, say them very slowly.
03 39 36.
Okay. You came in loud and clear.
All righty.
03 39 36 for 3 Charlie.
That's affirmative.
Okay.
Let me give you a GMT time hack, see how we are there at this time.
Yeah. That's probably all fouled up. Okay. You give it to me.
On my mark, I'm 15 27 00 - MARK.<sup>T</sup>
27?
Affirm.
Holy Malone! That's got a, okay, that thing is, really a pile of gabog. I've got 24.
. . ..
Well, let me try that GMT on my back-up clock here. Any time.
Want a mark on the back-up?
Yeah.
Okay. 03 12 25 on my mark. - MARK.<sup>T</sup>
That was 15 47 30. Is that correct?
I gave you a mark on CET, CET.
Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry, I was looking at my back-up.
Okay.
Let's try for CET again at 50 (seconds).
Roger, in 3 seconds. MARK.<sup>T</sup>
Okay. I am a second and a half fast.
Very good.
GMT - of 28 coming up, actually, I've passed it.
Give me 28 15.
MARK.<sup>T</sup>
Very good, I'm about 3 seconds slow on the back-up. That's the best one.
. . ..
Say again.
Roger. Did you see Echo?
Negative. I could not get to it. I was trying to conserve some more fuel there, and couldn't get pitched up in the right attitude for it.
Roger. How about Mercury?
Mercury? Loud and clear. I used Mercury and the moon for my night yaw check.
Roger.
No, this thing has, ah, practically no rates indicated, Deke, but I'm now, I'd say rolled over, oh, probably 30 degrees to the left. - Pretty close to pitch attitude, and of course it's pretty hard to tell what yaw is under these conditions.
Roger. Eat and drink - you're also fading.
Okay. I think I'll try some of that.
Roger. We'll leave you alone for awhile.
Okay. That might be fun, too. I'm now going to go ahead and do an orientation test.
. . ..
Okay. Thank you.
Okay. On the orientation test. - I touched the manual lever; I touched the clock, a rivet above the clock at about 10 30 just between the clock face and the yaw indicator. On the emergency rate lever, I touched it right on the button.
You're coming in garbled. You must have your mouth full
No. I'm just, ha ha, I'm talking about my orientation test.
Roger.
Okay. We finally got the right scale for this. - I've got to go to VOX record. Got the right scale for the dosimeter - and it is reading - about, less than 0.1, exactly 0.04. I am now putting the dosimeter back on the hatch - which is the lowest scale reading.
I'm back on VOX transmit now. Do you read, Deke? I've ended up with a beautiful 90 degree roll to the left. Boy, what a nice eight-point roll this is. Coming up for HF reception. Going to transmit HF, VOX off.
Sigma Seven. Cape Cap Com. Do you read? We are approaching LOS.
This is Sigma Seven broadcasting on HF. Deke, how do you read this now?
It should be noted that the ammeter is reading 12 amps as advertised - apparently, somebody is getting to me with a R Cal on the cabin 0<sub>2</sub>. The ammeter is just about exactly on 12 amps.
There is a slight rate in yaw about ½ degree per second, it's almost impossible to take out without having to fly it out. This does look like an appropriate time to get ready for an HF check. Turning the VOX to push-to-talk.
Sigma Seven this is Cape Cap Com. Transmitting HF, for a voice check. At 03    10 - MARK. <sup>T</sup>
Sigma Seven this is Canary Com Tech. Transmitting HF check at 03 20 21, MARK, out. <sup>T</sup>
Sigma Seven this 03 20 30 Kano.
Going to VOX record. Looking at the window with sun glow all over it. It definitely is a smoked pattern with streaks of light. Powdery debris on it - some of it has a pink color, sort of a pinkish-orange color. Probably from the RTV 90 sealing devices that were around the rings and sealing parts of the system - the tower jettison system.
Definitely have a reduced visibility as a result of this. The rate, at this point, at 3 23 35, MARK,<sup>T</sup> are almost all zeros.
Sigma Seven this is Canary Cap Com. Transmitting on UHF/HF.
Hello, Ca . . .

Roger. I'm having a ball up here drifting. Enjoying it so much I haven't eaten yet. I'm going to start to eat now. Over.
Sigma Seven this is Canary Cap Com. Do you still read?
That's affirmative, Canary. Do you read me?
I read you about 4 by 4.
Roger.
How's everything now?
Very good.
At this point, I definitely have a feeling of flying along yawed, 90 degrees, rolled right 30 degrees, and pitch almost right on the horizon.
Roger. Sigma Seven. I did not read.
Roger. I have a slight yaw rate about a half a degree per second. I'm recording as well as transmitting, naturally, and I appear to be yawing right around into proper yaw angle.
Sigma Seven this is Canary Cap Com. You're unreadable.
Roger.
In VOX record. I've just checked the stick out - while in drifting flight - to see if I would get any rates built up by stroking the stick, and I did not. It's working beautifully.
Visor open - now.

Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is IOS Cap Com . . ..
On the powering up. I went to gyros normal, finally, after getting gyros set at approximately three zeros with the maneuver off. There was no high thruster transition. Then, when I set up for three zeros, I did get a high thruster transition in the reentry select attitude. However, this is probably due to the no rate gyro run up case.
I am flying at three zeros on ASCS mode at this time, to see if this helps me reestablish. At approximately 4 hours, I just find out where I am as far as the moon goes.
Having little trouble getting stars oriented as to which ones they are, and this is going to be the problem. Particularly with two gadgets to hold in your hand for a computer. This doesn't help one bit.
There is a star that occurs at 3 hours and 53 minutes. What it is, is going to take a while to find out. Read the computer, set up, 3 hours and 53 minutes, and the time at 55, set up to a standard - 56 minutes . . . standard . . ..
I should have the moon - in sight - by now - and do not. Therefore, I better go searching for it.
Going to fly-by-wire low. Gyros free.
Going to gyros caged. Gyros are caged.
There's Cassiopeia which is to the north.
There's our friend the moon. We're due over Muchea at what time, 4 hours - get set up then.
Gyros are going to be . . ..

Roger. Read you and clear also. I called you two or three times on HF and got no answer. You're loud and clear on UHF. How's your status?
Roger. My status is fine.
Are all systems under control?
That's affirmative. I just used the moon to lock on. I will give you a short report. I'm just going to go on the ASCS . . . if you watch my thrusters.
Roger.
I will go on ASCS; reentry attitude.
Roger. You're on now according to us.
Roger. I'm just about going in. I'm not on it. Ha. Ha.
Okay. I'm going in it now, on gyros free. I'm going to go to gyros normal.
Okay, Gene. I'll give you a readout on what we've got up here.
Okay.
First off, I'm in auto reentry; I'm in auto; gyros are normal; maneuver is off; all configuration is of reentry; bypass switch for rate gyros is in normal. Give you a fuel readout, the auto tank is 90 (percent), manual is about 90 (percent). Give you a read on the suit which has been very comfortable now. The suit temperature is 60 (degrees). My dome is down to 45 (degrees). I'm going to back it off a half a notch. I'll go to 0 and then come back up again. Over.
Okay, Wally. Stand by.
Sigma Seven. How about blood pressure?
On the way.
Roger. John Glenn suggests that you have time when the numerous particles first appear, at sunrise, to tap the side of the capsule, and test his favorite theory.
Roger. I have done that Gene, and they do come from the capsule.
Roger. And he suggests later on, when they appear like white particles, that you do the same and this might prove that they are the same particles.
I tried that too.
You got the same result?
That's affirmative.
Roger.
Sigma Seven. If you're not doing anything, can you give us an attitude readout.
Okay. My indicated attitudes are 0 degrees pitch, 10 degrees left yaw, 0 degrees roll. Over.
We concur. Very good.
Roger. How do the scanners look?
Within 4 degrees, Wally. They are consistent, also.
Roger. I think I got the bear lined up pretty well, then.
Roger. Everything looks very good here. You sound very good, and it looks like go for 6. I think from here I'll just ask the doctor in.
Okay.
How do you feel?
Very good. I'm enjoying the ride very much.
Excellent.
You can tell Chris I got bored racking around and I just decided to give him his auto retro. Actually auto reentry attitude at this point. Over.
Roger.
Sigma Seven. Woomera Cap Com.
Hello, Woomera. Go ahead.
Sigma Seven. Woomera Cap Com. Did you say you were going to auto retro?
Negative. I'm in auto reentry at this point.
Roger. We received your Muchea report, and we're standing by.
Roger, Woomera. Thank you.
What is your comfort control valve suit setting?
Roger. It is now set at 7.5. I went back to 0 and came back up again. Over.
(Roger.)<sup>G</sup> Would you repeat that last part?
Say again?
We received you going to zero, but we didn't know what it was set at.
Roger. 7.5.
(All systems)<sup>G</sup> green at Woomera.
Roger. My suit dome is 62 degrees at this time.
Suit dome 62 (degrees).
Correct.
Thank you. You . . ..
You reported the suit dome at 45 (degrees) over Muchea. Is this correct?
That's correct. It moved that fast.
(Good.)<sup>G</sup>
We are about to have LOS here at Woomera.
Roger.
Anything else for the Cape?
Negative. Everything's going along fine here.
Roger.
Roger. At this period, I'm looked ahead at the flight plan. I frankly feel that a lot more star information is needed, for nailing down attitudes - or a better computer. I'm rapidly working here when I shouldn't have to be.
At 4 11, it is 1 15 on the star chart computer, . . ..
I have Jupiter off on the right side, right corner of the window.
. . . Altair
I can see the double stars of Grus all forming a line - coming right into the center of the window. Jupiter, of course, is a real bright one. I can see Ankaa and - correction Al Naiir, and that, this must have been Peacock. Al Naiir is slightly to the right of the flight path. I'm flying, but that must be her. Jupiter shows up in the corner of the window. Proper head position, Formalhaut shows up to the right of flight path. Jupiter in the right corner. It checks at this time. Very nice.
. . ..
Don't tell me this compass is working? I should talk more. What I have been doing, I have been getting the standard source of light out. At this point, for the capsule, for my face because I am looking straight up at the compass is really rolling in the plane of the roll axis. I have a North pointing toward my right elbow. The compass definitely takes a swing when I moved
The compass is too much affected by the attitude instruments and gyros behind them. That's why I can't bring it to close to them. I am holding it just about halfway between the instrument panel and my face and in reference to a line halfway between the glove box and the pack. At the CE time of 4 18, it is pointing directly at the forward hatch clamp line. It seems that this is the restraining pin link for the hatch. I guess they can stow that for future reference.
. . . get rid of that for awhile.
We are on time 4 hours and 19 minutes. On ASCS and I will pinch down. At this point, going to fly-by-wire low - to reentry attitude for Hawaii.
Selecting reentry attitude.
Always surprising when you finally see some object and the rate really shows up.
I am stopping the capsule in reentry attitude. Taking roll out. Yaw is zero; roll is coming out. I want to acquire this, and then watch it. Roll looks good. Pitch is coming in; yaw is coming in. Rates and attitude are good, . . . ASCS a little low thruster tweek and very nice. I will warm up the T<sub>r</sub>-10, gyros for their benefit. And starting to get some light on the scope, just barely.
I have a feeling I am off in pitch, but I think it is that damn horizon air glow line. Makes you think it's higher than it is. I still have the feeling though that I am pitched down about 10 degrees further than I want to be. If we are that close, we will let the scanner work on the problem.
Now we are indicating retroattitude. We are fairly close to it. So the scanners are torquing it up about 5 degrees I'd say.
Sigma Seven. Hawaii Cap Com.
Roger. Hawaii Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. How do you read?
We are reading you okay now. How about giving a short report?
Okay, good. I am in ASCS; retroattitude; gyros are normal; the maneuver switch is off. I am warming up the T<sub>r</sub>-10 bypass for the rate gyros. I still have fly-by-wire low selected. All quantities and systems are green. I am green.
Roger. Could you give me your cabin dome temperature, and cabin temperature, and valve setting.
Roger. The suit dome is 68 (degrees). The cabin dome is 48 (degrees). The suit setting is 7.5. The cabin setting is 3. Over.
Roger. Give me your cabin temperature, suit temperature, and inverter setting.
Okay. Cabin temperature is 92 (degrees), and I'll give you inverters. Stand by. - Main inverter is, 250 inverter is about 143 (degrees). The 150 is 102 (degrees). Standby is about 115 (degrees).
Wally, I cut you out there. Give me your water valve setting on your inverter.
On the inverter it is 4.
Roger.
That seems to work pretty well so far for the whole flight, Gus.
Okay fine. Cape feels you are in good shape Wally, and so I have good news. They give you a go for 6 orbits.
Hallelujah.
They request you stay in retroattitude, and go ahead and prepare for retro like you would normally.
I understand.
And remain in retroattitude until you pass your (recovery area) retro 3-1 time.
I understand.
And then proceed with your flight plan.
Okay, Gus. I will see you out there shortly.
Roger.
These attitudes look honest as can be, Gus.
Roger.
How do the scanners check out with you?
You're looking real good down here, Wally. We can see nothing wrong.
Good deal. I use the moon and then later on Jupiter to line up some of the other stars. A little too dim to bet on every time.
Roger.
The star computer device I have helps a lot to confirm stars, but it's a little hard to acquire them to begin with.
Roger.
I guess the only thing I don't have is your suit inlet temperature. Could you give me that?
Roger, 62 (degrees).
62 (degrees). That sounds good.
Yeah. It's been very comfortable since I finally got that final setting.
Roger.
How much water have you had Wally?
I took a big sip awhile ago, and then I just had a tube of peaches and a couple of those cubes.
Okay. Good,
Now it looks like a good time to take a drink of water, over you.
Visor open?
My visor is open now.
Roger. Visor open.
Wally, give me your pressure . . . readout.
Just a second Gus, I am trying to stow this water hose.
Okay.
Partial pressure oxygen.
Say again.
Are you asking for PO<sub>2</sub> ?
Roger.
Okay stand by. That is about 4.2 (psi) and I am back on the suit again.
Roger.
That is actually as pure as we normally would have it. That is why I didn't want to stay on too long.
Roger. Check your visor close.
Roger. The visor is closed and sealed up. Suit visor bottle is way up in the green.
Roger.
Well Gus. We - at least we got some fuel coming over here this time.
Sigma Seven. Cal Cap Com.
Cal Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. Read you. Do you read me? Over.
Roger. Read you loud and clear, Wally. Looks like it is all go for a next orbit. Do you concur?
Roger. Everything feels good here, John.
Roger. Standing by for your report.
Roger. I am in ASCS auto at this time; in reentry attitude; the gyros are normal; maneuver is off; all systems are green. Auto fuel is 89 (percent), manual is 90 (percent). My temperatures at this point are very comfortable. The suit inlet is 62 (degrees), the dome is 69 (degrees). I believe I am all set to power down. Over.
Roger. That's next on the flight plan here. You are all set to power down if you concur. And I would like to check your clock setting. What do you have on the clock there? Over.
Okay. I will give you a mark at 30 seconds.
Your ECT I have here, what's your setting for retrosequence. Over.
Roger. 08 hours + 50 + 21.
Roger. Thank you.
What is your cabin pressure, Wally?
Roger, the cabin pressure is just about 5.1 (psi).
Okay. Sounds good.
Right. Not much time for that one for this orbit is there John?
What? Say again please?
There wasn't much time to get ready for coming down, coming down this time was there? Sorry I couldn't go back to Hawaii for you this way. I'll see you out there, I guess.
Wally, yeah right here at the end of six. Do you have any comment with regard to relative motion of those particles that you saw? Did you see any of them moving past, or did you see any of them coming toward you if you were facing in the direction of flight? Over.
I never had the direct opportunity of them coming toward me John, but they definitely were going away from me. I could get a big blast of them, either green fireflies or white ice crystals, by rapping on the capsule almost anytime.
Roger. If you happen to have a chance at sunrise, anytime between now and end of flight, you might see whether you can see any coming toward you during that period also.
Roger. Understand.
Okay. I am going to shove off for a relaxation period.
Good show. Understand you are going to power down.
That's affirm. I'll give you a readout on it, so you can watch it.
(Roger)<sup>G</sup>
Going to fly-by-wire. Going to gyros caged.
Roger.
Gyros are three zeros at this time. ASCS bus off. I have 0 volts.
Roger. Powering down the beacons, ground command.
T/M's dropped.
Roger. I have 12 amps at this time.
Roger. That's what we show.
Roger. Okay I am going from fly-by-wire back to normal now, so I can keep a cold stick.
Roger.
Okay. I am in normal, and I am going to select reentry attitude select for powering up time.
And she's all set.
. . . this is Cal, you are looking good. . . . see you next time around.
Right'o John, and thanks so much for your help.
Roger.
At 04 36 37. I took a light reading, and the light value is 13 for ASA 160.
Roger. Got it.
I'll see if I can flounder around with the camera now and get a picture of the Baja.
Roger. I understand getting a picture of Baja California.
I am just breaking out the camera now, John.
Okay, very good.
Right. I'm sure I'll be ready for it though.
Okay. Setting in 11 - and we can look down towards the Salton Sea again - on infinity.
Yeah. That's a pretty good setting from up there.
Yeah. . . . actually, I am looking north of the Salton Sea because of the yaw effect I must have in here. There is just a slight yawing effect just left of the capsule. Maybe about a quarter of a degree per second. Enough to bring me up towards the U.S.A.
Roger. Understand. Little slow yaw rate to the left. You are beginning to fade a little bit here. Probably won't get you much longer.
Okay. I'm yawing to the right. Sorry I misled you.
Roger.
Going to VOX record.
Roger. Standby 1 second Deke.
Roger. Made a dosimeter check, and it is still less than the last reading.
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven in UHF-hi. Go ahead.
Cape Cap Com, this is Sigma Seven, UHF-hi. Go ahead.
Go ahead, Sigma Seven, this is Cape Cap Com.
Cape Cap Com, Sigma Seven UHF-hi. How do you read? Over.
You are now coming in about 4 by.
Roger. I am in drifting mode, everything is working beautifully.
. . .
Say again.
. . .
You are coming in garbled Deke.
Here are your retro times, if you are ready.
Roger. I think I will be through in a second. I will take them.
Roger.
(Recovery area) 4-2 is 05 44 05.
Do that one over again and I will be right on. You're in clear now.
Okay 4-2 is 05 44 05.
Okay. 4-2 is 05 44 05.
Right. (recovery area) 6-1 is 08 51 24.
24.
(Contingency recovery areas) A and B are nominal and I'd like to give you a GMT hack and see what your clock is doing now. Give you one at 16 57 35. MARK.<sup>T</sup>
Roger. I'm reading 55 45.
Pretty good.
Let's check the backup clock and we will hack that.
Roger.
Anytime.
For your information, we are going to start calling you Venus. IOS visually sighted you on the last pass.
How about that?
Did you have your steak?
Yeah. Did you?
Yeah. It was okay. Did you eat it?
Would you do me a time hack again on GMT?
Okay, GMT. 16 58 15. MARK.<sup>T</sup>
15 okay. I'm 15 - that was just about 3 seconds slow on my backup clock.
Very good. Flight would like to talk to you now.
Okay.
Wally, we have some Echo sighting data. You prepared to copy?
Just get my pencil out. Standby. Okay, go Chris.
00 17 30 is contact time for 4 minutes. Azimuth 99.5 (degrees), elevation 90 (degrees). Echo will be in the light, the capsule in the dark.
That should be fun, shouldn't it?
Roger. Been a real good show up there. I think we are proving our point old buddy.
I hope so Chris. I am enjoying it.
Roger.
Sigma Seven . . . standing by.
Roger.
Sigma Seven, Cape Flight.
Okay, Flight.
We are ready to go into fast time if you are.
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! That's a good one. Very good.
Sigma Seven, Cape Flight.
Go ahead there Chris.
The . . . retrosequence now shows 08 51 21 which means you can advance it exactly 1 minute and that would be the correct time. You can do that anytime you want to.
Advance it 1 minute?
Affirmative. That would be 08 51 21.
Okay. I will throw a minute in now. You reading me alright?
Affirmative.
Okay.
. . . That's a trick. Okay, I got 08 51 20 . I'll throw another second in. I've got 08 plus 51 plus 21.
Roger. We concur.
Roger.
Ah boy, I just happened to drift into an inverted position right now. For some reason or another, you can tell that the bowl was upside down.
Cape Flight, Sigma Seven.
. . .
You can tell Cape Sir John that we have practically nothing on the navel engagement.
Sigma Seven, this is Cape Cap Com, we did not get your message to Sir John.
Roger. Never mind.
. . . Cape Cap Com.
I took picture 4, - 4a at 4 48 29, which is the coast of United States. I assume - I will have to look at my map shortly and see where we are. A rather large cloud mass at this point. We will stow the camera again. The drift rate isn't consistent enough that you can just take a picture and then put the camera away. Plus, the camera is a little hard to take out and put back in again.
At 4 hours and 50 minutes, I can't get that camera back out of that box again. Time to take a picture. Better stay in there for awhile.
Camera will not work in (to) the glove box favorably.
Reading at light value 13-½, and a . . . inside.
. . . .
I punched the wrong button twice. I did not get a picture of the iris.
I am just about straight down. We will take some cumulus pictures. The time hack is 4 hours 51 minutes. The picture will be a 5a color.
The dome (temperature) is holding at 70 degrees. Cabin dome is 50 degrees. Suit inlet is comfortable at 62 (degrees). Suit pressure is steady at 5 psi. Very interesting cloud formation for picture 6b on the color back. Rather nice collection of circular clouds.
. . . shot at 250 56. (1/250 second at f 5.6).
At 04 53 53. Bit of in a rolled over attitude with the nose fairly high. . . . the light value (setting) was 13.
I can actually see the little object that looked like a snowflake this time, going away from the capsule. In the same flight path, of course. Definitely, looked like a piece of white, but it is quite visible against the black sky that I see now. . . . the stars that go away from us. Definitely has a different velocity than the capsule itself.
4 55 and still am sighting some of the snowflake effects. 250 inverter is now approximately 135 degrees. Suit dome (temperature) is 72 (degrees). The cabin dome is about 46 (degrees).
Sun right in view again. . . . that should be the proper yaw angle, approximately, because that's where the sun would be at sunset.
Coming up on 5 hours, so I'll be getting prepared to copy the intermediate report at this time. I will not put the camera all the way in the case at . . .
. . .
Capsule is working very well at this point. 250 (inverter) is 132 (degrees), 150 (inverter) is . . . 5. Standby (inverter) is 120 . . . thrusters . . . right, over 100 (degrees) left. Pitch down (thruster) is 105 (degrees). Pitch up (thruster) is 100 (degrees). Cabin heat exchanger (setting) is 4.0. Roll left manual (thruster)is 79 (degrees). Roll right auto (thruster) is 110 (degrees), roll left auto (thruster) is 105 (degrees). Think we will go back and pick up the retro. Temperature is 80 (degrees). This is at almost exactly 5 hours.
Ready for the 5 o'clock report. Fuel is 89-90 (percent). Oxygen 56-75 (psi, in hundreds). Suit inlet is . . .. Dome (temperature) is 70 (degrees). Cabin dome (setting) is . . . 0.8. That should be enough for now.
Got more targets of opportunity.
At 5 hours and 1 minute I am shooting pictures of weather almost vertically. There is a light value of 13-½. Gives me 250 and 5 6 (1/250 second and f5.6) roughly. Infinity is the setting.
Light value of 13 for that same subject. I shot at 13-½. Seems like a very low setting.
If I don't talk much more than this, it won't be very long to real time this tape recorder. Coming up on IOS at 5 hours and 15 minutes. Quite obvious that you don't care really what attitude you are in. There is always that concern about trying to get back into the attitude you must be in. Particularly, when you are coming around at the end of the third orbit to buy off on a go or no-go.
When I get much more I look at the earth. Rates at this time, having powered down at approximately 4 hours and 35 minutes are almost exactly 0. There is a very, very slight pitch rate. Approximately maybe ½ degree per second.
. . . stowing the camera again . . . to get out until after . . ..
Okay, should be coming up on Africa pretty soon. Tip her over and see how she looks without light.
. . . sunlight in my eyes now. Get a tan on this flight at last.
Hello Ascension, hello Ascension, this is Sigma Seven. Over.
Hello Ascension, hello Ascension, this is Sigma Seven. Over.
Hello Ascension, hello Ascension, this is Sigma Seven. Over.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, Ascension Cap Com on HF, do you read?
This is Sigma Seven. I read a station, very garbled, please identify.
At this point in time, which is of course just prior to sunset, we are coming up with a batch of the white particles. They show up in the blue sky. I have the horizon almost in sight. And they are drifting away from me.
Let's check and see if we actually do get yaw out of these. They are tending to go up in relation to me, rather than tending to draw away aft. With this kind of lighting I can really see the illusion of visibility, due to the external problem of having smoke on the outer panel. Definitely is not on inner panels. It is quite easy to see by changing panels through reflections that it's the outer panel.
We are now going into night coming up on 5 hours 11 minutes. Suit dome is setting at 7.0 very happily. Suit itself is at 62 (degrees) and I am happy.
Testing, 1 2.
I have some pretty stars in sight, and also I have the little white objects that seem to come from the capsule itself and drift off. If they are a yaw check it's fantastic. I suspect that the star I see is Arcturus. It would be very interesting - it is neither. It is one of the white objects . . . two stars are staying quite still. The white object actually looked like it came toward me, but it wasn't. I can actually see the particle now, flying off as John described it, as a lathe shaving. It's a very good description of it.
My rates are now just about 0 in all three axes. I still have light in the periscope, of course. I am looking straight up and yet at this point which is . . . , that my attitude is - let me get into the couch here. I really can't pick it too well, I am just about inverted at this point, and that my nose is above the horizon. As a result I notice that these particles keep tending aft of me, relative to me at any time.
Periscope is blacking out rather rapidly at sunset.
It is almost blacked out completely at this point. It is really not usable.
Getting a real burst of light in the window. I really don't know what it is. At this point I should be coming up on the sunset. Five hours 15 minutes. Periscope is dark. I must be just getting a last look at the horizon; yet I'm not down on it. Here we go into night rather rapidly. Now we're into the night side. I am apparently pointed towards the surface of the earth, as I can see clouds with lightning in them.
Indian Ocean Ship, this is Sigma Seven. How do you read? Over.
. . . with a little bit of background noise. Over.
Roger, I have to run my volume up to read you. I am talking UHF-hi at this time. I am drifting, and I suppose dreaming. I understand you saw me last time, over.
That is Roger. We had a 5 minute visual sighting for about 9 degrees or over.
Very good. Looks like you've got some lightning down your way now.
Do you have an intermediate report for me at this time?
That's affirmative. Are you ready to copy - all systems were green at the time. At 5 hours fuel was 89 (percent) auto, 90 manual. Oxygen 56 (psi, in hundreds) primary, 75 secondary. Were you copying?
Roger, I have your load and oxygen only at this time.
Roger. The fuel quantity, did you get that?
Negative.
Okay, 89 (percent) automatic, 90 manual.
Roger. Your gyros and maneuver switch?
Okay, gyros are caged, maneuver switch is off. I am powered down.
Roger. We have request from the Cape for a blood pressure reading since they did not get one at pass over at MCC. Over.
Okay, you deserve one anyway. Coming up. In addition, I would like to give you the suit inlet temperature, which was 62 degrees.
Roger.
The suit dome (temperature) is 70 degrees and the circuit is comfortable.
Wonderful. We also have a request from the Cape. On your next pass over California, between 6 08 and 6 10, they are going to pass your voice to live TV. Over.
Roger, understand at 6 08 to 6 10.
They would like you to say something to the live TV audience at that time. Over.
Roger.
At this time I will perform an orientation test. Missed the manual fuel (handle) by 2 inches, and capsule repressurization (handle).
Try to touch the yaw attitude (indicator) touched the yaw attitude (indicator) at 270 degree indication. Try to touch the manual emergency rate lever. And I will - I put my hand right on it. I believe I am through on this test over the other (yawning) - I'm yawning - by considerable margin.
Sigma Seven, this is IOS Cap Com.
Go ahead.
Readouts at this time?
Say again.
Anything you want from the ground readouts at this time?
Negative, looks like everything's clean. I guess there's not much sense in giving me scanners because I'm pretty well cruising along here.
Roger, do you have your time on your intermediate report.
That was at 5 hours 00 minutes 00 seconds.
Good.
I can see my attitude now. I am - looks like it's pretty good attitude. It's pitched down about 55 or 60 degrees.
No, that's all wrong. I can now see that I must have been inverted. The horizon is coming into view, and some stars.
Sigma Seven, IOS Cap Com, 1 minute to LOS.
Roger, IOS, thank you for your cooperation and enjoyed talking with you.
IOS, I'm going to try HF again after I leave you just to see how we do.
Indian Ocean Ship, this is Sigma Seven on HF. How do you read? Over.
IOS, this is Sigma Seven on HF. How do you read? Over.
This flight I think I can take a whack at this photometer at last.
Turn off the cabin lights first. - It's off - Extincted - total loss.
Getting - getting a good look at Orion at this time. Beautiful view of it. There are the Pleiades, Alvagrin. I'll look at Alvagrin and see what I can do with that.
I have extincted Alvagrin to read at 05 27 27. Now this experiment isn't going to be valuable; I need cabin lights to see. It's awfully hard to find the extinction photometer. Let's see if I can do it now. Contrasted Alvagrin, the standard source, under the same lighting conditions. Extincted at 3.8.
I'm unable to run any more tests on stars at time. I am coming back to the view of the surface of the earth. There's quite a bit of moonlight, and as a result the horizon is very bright.
I'll put the photometer in an area where it may be available again. At 05 28 48, the rates are almost exactly-negative-yaw is 0; pitch is -½; and roll is roll left ½. We definitely have a cold stick.
This quiet time must be getting to a lot of people on the ground. I think we should probably put some more data in here. Gathered at 5 hours and 31 minutes. And about this time they want an intermediate report. We'll get it for them.
Okay, we'll take an electrical check. Main bus is 24 (volts) - Isolated bus is - clicking because of the clock, of course-and that's 27 to 27-½ (volts).
Hello Muchea Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. I read you. How me, over?
Sigma Seven, this is Muchea Cap Com. I think I read . . . say again.
Roger, this is Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear, Gene. There is no change in my status. Over.
Sigma Seven, this is Muchea, I did not read you very well, but would request blood pressure. Doctor Berry would appreciate blood pressure during last three orbits.
Roger, Gene. I say there is no change in my status since the last report at 0500. Over.
Roger, understand no change in status since your last report.
That is correct; all quantities are the same.
All quantities are the same.
Roger. And temperatures. Gene, I do have one change. The 250 inverter is now 120 (degrees).
Roger. check, 250 inverter is now 120 (degrees).
Very good.
Roger. We do not have telemetry, so, if you pressed your blood pressure button it isn't doing us any good. If we get telemetry, we'll give you another call.
I was wondering how the heck you were gonna get it. It will go onboard (tape recorder) though. All d-c power is 25 volts or greater. Over.
Say again.
All d-c power, d-c, is 25 volts or greater. Over.
Did you say d-c volts are 25?
That is affirmative. All of them - they are all in good shape.
This is Sigma Seven, at 5 hours, 36 minutes, 45 seconds. No yaw rate, a slight left roll rate of ½ degree per second. A slight pitch up of ¼ degree per second.
Sigma Seven, this is Muchea. I have not read your transmissions for the last minute. Hand you over to PCS.
Roger, Muchea.
Hello, Pacific Command Ship, Pacific Command Ship. This is Sigma Seven on HF. Over.
Hello, Pacific Command Ship. PCS, this is Sigma Seven. HF. Over.
Hello PCS, PCS. This is Sigma Seven. How do you read? Over.
Sigma Seven, PCS. We read you weak but readable. How me?
I read you loud and clear, Al. And nice to talk to you today.
. . ..
I am talking on HF at this time.
Standby, Seven.
Roger.
Seven, this is Cap Com. Anything you want to say.
Nothing in particular. Wanna say hello to you though. All the systems are perfect. There are no changes in quantities since the 05 00 summary. Over.
Roger. We have one message for you. They would like to attempt to contact you over Hawaii through the relay airplanes. So, would you please go up to UHF prior to acquisition of Hawaii? Over.
I understand, Al, Roger.
We do not have T/M as yet. We might pick it up in a couple of minutes.
Right, I'm - very far south of you as you know. How's the weather there?
You sound a little scratchy to me, Wally.
Roger, we're still pretty far apart. How is your weather there?
Say again.
How is the weather there?
Weather actually is fairly good here in location. I think on your next pass you might be able to see the typhoon. I'll give you a bearing and distance when you come over next time.
Very good, we had quite a flap on this suit circuit for the first orbit as you may know.
Sorry, Seven, not reading you very well.
Roger, I said we had a lot of trouble with the suit circuit in the beginning of the flight.
Sigma Seven, you're breaking up too much.
Roger. I'll be back.
Why don't you - why don't you take a rest for awhile, you've bean talking quite a bit.
Good show.
. . . Hawaii.
That is correct Al, and we'll talk better next time around.
Roger. See you next time.
Roger, it's real nice up here today.
At this point I'm in VOX record. I'm going to switch to UHF for relay aircraft in Hawaii area. The time is 05 hours 47 minutes 44 seconds.
. . . I'll give you a mark on GET of 05 48 00 - 3,2,1. MARK. GET 05 48 00.
Roger, I had that 03 seconds. I am 3 seconds fast on you Al.
Understand 3 seconds fast.
That is correct.
Roger.
I am going to switch to UHF at this time. You are really crystal clear here.
Roger. See you next time.
Roger.
This is Sigma Seven, broadcasting in the blind on UHF-hi. Does anybody read, over.
Hello Huntsville, hello Huntsville, this is Sigma Seven, do you read my UHF-hi, over.
At 05 hours, 50 minutes, I have a yaw rate of ½ degree per second right, a pitch rate of ½ degree per second up, a roll rate of ½ degree per second left.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, this is . . . Cap Com on HF, do you read?
This is Sigma Seven, station calling, I can just barely hear you over.
Sigma Seven Sigma Seven, this is Watertown Cap Com on HF. If you are copying me, Cape Flight requests that you go to UHF, go to UHF, and try to contact the relay aircraft. I say again - in the blind, Cape Flight requests that you go to UHF and attempt to contact the relay aircraft.
This is Sigma Seven, read you loud and clear Watertown. I have been on UHF.
Relay aircraft this is Sigma Seven. Please patch in Hawaii. Over.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, this is Watertown Cap Com. Cape Flight requests that you go to UHF - go to UHF - and attempt to contact relay aircraft.
This is Sigma Seven. I am on UHF. Understand requirement.
Relay Aircraft, Relay Aircraft, this is Sigma Seven. Over.
Relay . . . .
Hawaii Cap Com.
Hi Gussy. How are you reading me?
Hawaii Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. I just read you loud and clear.
Sigma Seven Sigma Seven, Hawaii Cap Com.
Hawaii Cap Com, this is Sigma Seven, read you loud and clear. How me?
Hawaii Cap Com, Sigma Seven, I read you very clear and loud. Over.
Sigma Seven Sigma Seven, this is Watertown Cap Com on HF. If you read, go to UHF, go to UHF, and attempt to contact relay aircraft.
Hawaii Cap Com, Hawaii Cap Com, Sigma Seven. Over.
Hello, Hawaii Cap Com. This is Sigma Seven. Over.
Hawaii Cap Com, Hawaii Cap Com, this is Sigma Sevn. Over.
This is Sigma Seven, giving the effects of flying inverted in a sunrise, 90 degrees yaw. It is the most obvious thing to you, what your direction of path is. Like looking out of a railroad train window. You see the terrain going by you. There are clouds of all varied types. I can see them sweeping by me just by the 90 degree plane-in the - 90 degrees to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle. Very, very graphic display of yaw. As I swing around now, my blunt end is starting to go into proper yaw attitude although I am inverted. I see a small island at this point. And it's nice and bright in the cockpit again. We have light at approximately 5 56 this pass. There, we're almost swung around into yaw now.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, Hawaii Com Tech. How do you read? Over.
This is Sigma Seven, UHF-hi. I read you loud and clear. How me?
Hawaii Com Tech, Sigma Seven, read you load and clear. How me? Over.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven, Hawaii Com Tech. How do you read? Over.
I read you loud and clear, Hawaii, how me? I believe I just saw Midway that time. Be back down that way a little later. That was right about 5 . . . 7 to 6 and looking back.
. . . do you read?
Hawaii Com Tech, Sigma Seven. Loud and clear.
Sigma Seven, Com Tech, Hawaii. How do you read?
Hawaii, Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear.
Sigma Seven, this is Hawaii, this is Hawaii Cap Com.
Hi, Gus. How are you doing?
Real good. How about you?
Oh, fine. I'm not bored up here. I just flew over Midway a while ago. Got a good look at that. I'm steaming up towards you-all now, of course, north of you. I gave Gene Duret my intermediate report - if he could pick me up on HF. Actually . . ..
Go ahead with your report.
Okay, as you know, the control mode is set up for drifting. The mode selected is normal, auto, gyros caged. I've selected reentry attitude. I'm of course in fly-by-wire low. The maneuver switch is off. I'll give you the fuel quantities and oxygen. Just to check yours against mine. I still have 89 (percent) auto and 90 (percent) manual.
Roger. Was that 89-90?
That's affirmative 89-90.
Roger
Oxygen, I have 55 and 75 (psi, in hundreds).
Roger.
At 05 hours no minutes no seconds, I have 56 (psi, in hundreds) on the oxygen and 75. There is practically no change on it.
Roger.
Suit inlet temperature is still about 61 to 62 (degrees). The dome is about 72. It's about as cool as I want it. It's just beautiful.
Roger. We confirm those quantities, Wally. Looks like you're in good shape. Did you get the message to go to UHF prior to elapsed time of 6 18.
Right, I have that on my card, also Watertown got it to me on HF. But neither Watertown nor you could hear me. I heard you loud and clear.
Were you reading me through relay?
That's affirmative, so I would suggest to you, broadcast in the blind if you have something hot for me.
Roger. I'll do that anyway, and I'm glad to hear that you got us at least.
Right, I heard you way back and, I'd say at about 5 hours and 53 minutes.
Say that time again.
Five hours and 53 minutes.
Repeat the whole time. I missed it.
Five hours 53 minutes.
Roger.
Sure breaking tradition on this pass.
Roger, how do you like drifting flight?
Great sport. The rates are not consistent. They do change.
Roger, understand. Your rates do change.
That's affirmative. I've never had more than about, of, I would say about 3/4 of a degree per second in any one direction.
Wally, you're cutting in and out on voice. Possibly we're losing it.
Okay. Can you read me better with the push-to-talk?
At 6 hours and 4 minutes - we have a 1 degree per second right yaw rate. 0 degree per second pitch, and 3/4 of a degree per second left roll. No change in fuel quantity. No detectible thruster action. We are swinging around and acquiring the horizon at this point.
California Cap Com, this is Sigma Seven, over.
Hello Sigma Seven, this is Cal Cap Com. How do you feel, over.
Read you loud and clear, John. How me?
You're loud and clear. Everything's solid down here. I guess you got the word on the 6 08 bit. Is that affirm?
That's affirmative. You have T/M on me now? I'll power up before all that jazz.
Okay, Roger. T/M is solid.
Okay. I have gyros normal, auto, gyros caged. I am going to power up and then go - correction - gonna power up and fly-by-wire. Monitoring the a-c bus at this time. She comes up to 115 (volts). I have 25 amps, in good shape.
Roger. We confirm.
I'll hold off on my beacon. Clock's at 6 06 approximately I guess, when I powered up, so that it would be good at about 6 11. I have no change in consumables, John. It looks real good here.
Roger. Everything's looking fine here. We have T/M solid and we confirm your actions here.
Roger. I got a real weird attitude at this point I'll clue you. Ha, ha, I'm looking down at the earth. I'm sort of coming toward you head first, inverted.
Roger. You can pick your own up from that standpoint.
Yeah. You really get the illusion you're ready for a split S every once in a while, don't you?
Right.
Wally, I'll give you a count to the 6 08 here so we . . . start in. They're going to have it on for 2 minutes beginning at 6 08. That's about 20 seconds, here.
Okay, John, sounds like fun.
Okay, Sigma Seven. This is Cal Cap Com. You're at 6 08. Two minutes on live TV. Go ahead, Wally.
Roger, John. Just came out of the powered down configuration where we had the ASCS inverter off. It came up in good shape and will stay on now for the rest of the flight. The amps and volts are reading properly. The amps are now down to about 19 amps, after we powered up. They were up to 25 at first. I'm coming toward you inverted this time, which is an unusual way for any of us to approach California, I'll admit.
Roger, Wally, you got anything to say to everyone, watching you across country on this thing. We're going out live on this.
That sounds like great sport, I can see why you and Scott like it. I'm having a trick now. I'm looking at the United States and starting to pitch up slightly with this drifting rate. And I see the moon, which I'm sure no one in the United States can see as well as I right now.
I think you're probably right.
Ha, ha. I suppose an old song "Drifting and Dreaming" would be apropos at this point, but at this point I don't have a chance to dream. I'm enjoying it too much.
Things are looking real good from here, Wally.
Thank you, John. I guess that what I'm doing right now is sort of a couple of Immelmans across the United States.
Roger. Wally, have you had a chance to observe a haze layer any?
Yes, I have. It's quite fascinating; in fact, it's misleading in the evening. Gives you the feeling that you are pitched down quite far. Have you noticed that?
Roger.
It's projected up much higher in the evening.
Ah, I see you got me on a Z Cal.
Negative, did not send Z Cal, Over.
Oh, somebody did. Maybe Scotty.
May have.
Roger . . . Z Cal off now.
See, you can't be sneaky with me, can you Scott? Now I got the P O<sub>2</sub> (oxygen partial pressure), which goes to 0 when you do that. Okay, R Cal. How's that? Anybody want blood pressure.
Say again, Wally.
Okay, I'll send you blood pressure now.
Roger, standing by. Cal coming off.
Blood pressure on.
We have your blood pressure. Standing by for a standard report.
Roger, Scott. I am in drifting flight, but I have powered up the ASCS a-c bus. It has come on the line very well. I will power up the beacons later. The control mode selected is fly-by-wire although I'm not controlling in it. The auto switch is auto, gyros switch is still caged. The reentry attitude is selected, maneuver is off. The quantities are all in the green. Suit temperature is about 60 (degrees). I'm quite comfortable with it. Electrical is green and a-c is green.
Roger, and could we have one more blood pressure, please. I didn't get the last. Your (recovery area) 5-1 TORF (time of retrofire) I have. Are you ready to copy?
Let me get that first, then I'll give you the blood pressure.
Roger, 07 18 10.
07 18 10.
That's Roger. At 07 18 10, and for your information, Ascension copied you on your last pass and they are standing by to copy you again this time.
Roger, I'll send you a BPMS.
Roger.
I have your 07 18 10.
That is Roger, 07 18 10 for (recovery area) 5-1.
Roger.
Incidentally, Wally, if we have LOS before we read the last of your blood pressure, don't forget to turn her off.
Roger. Thank you.
Going to VOX record only momentarily.
Now in the dosimeter check, it is still reading less than 1/10 on the lowest scale.
(Picture) Able 8 taken at 06 14 40. A coastline. It should have been the coast of . . . Tampico, just south of Texas.
All color shots have been made so far, no black and white I'm going to try to take another shot here of a cloud structure, at 06 15 30.
Go ahead. Go ahead. Cape Cap Com.
Sigma Seven. Cape Cap Com.
This is Sigma Seven. Go ahead, Deke.
Roger, you're coming in weak and intermittent. Can you read us? Over.
Roger. I'm coming up at this time at - just across the Yucatan Peninsula here.
Sigma Seven. Standby, we're still not reading you.
Roger.
Sigma Seven. Cap Com. Let's try it again.
Deke, this is Sigma Seven. Just passing over the Yucatan peninsula.
Roger. You're still weak and intermittent.
Roger.
Sigma Seven. Cap Com. How do you read now?
I read you loud and clear. How me?
Roger, you are loud and clear. You were very garbled before.
Roger. I'm doing partial control on fly-by-wire low. Will acquire ASCS when I get in retroattitude. No problem, just the bird's flying beautifully, and give her a break.
Roger.
When you have a yaw of 90 degrees, it's just like looking at a train window - that's all there is to it. That's about what I'm going through now. Just walking right around the horizon, Deke.
(Roger)<sup>G</sup>
Let's put a little . . ..
. . . pressure for environment.
Say again, Deke.
Give us a cabin pressure.
Roger. Standby. Okay. It's about - just about 5 (psi) on the button.
Roger.
Okay.
Have you eaten yet? We haven't been able to confirm this.
That's affirmative. I had some peaches and a couple of cubes. I didn't want to eat it all up in one batch.
That's a good idea.
Spread it out a little bit, you know.
How are you feeling in general?
Very fine, Deke. It's the first time I've had a chance to relax since last December. I've been exercising a little bit to get my muscles toned up as well. Not exactly walking around but a little bit of stretching.
. . . (You say - you say you are what?)<sup>G</sup>
Roger.
Did you say you'd like to get up and walk around?
I did a little exercise.
Roger. Understand.
I'm just about in retroattitude now. Just about made a complete 180 (degrees).
(Roger Seven, Cape Cap Com . . ..)<sup>G</sup>
I'm going to pick up pitch very shortly.
This is Sigma Seven. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Hello, Cape Cap Com . . ..
Go ahead. Cape Cap Com.
This is Sigma Seven. I read you loud and clear.
. . ..
. . . Cape Com Tech. How do you read?
How do you read Auto One?
Roger.
That's affirm. What's your problem?
That's affirmative. For God sakes.
Auto One. Warfare. Do you read me?
Roger. Go bravo then.
Auto Two Bravo.
Auto Two. Warfare. Do you read?
Roger. Give Sigma Seven a call.
This is Sigma Seven. I read you. What do you want?
Hello Sigma Seven. Cape Cap Tech. How do you copy?
I copy you loud and clear, Murph.
Roger. Standby for Cape, please.
Okay.
Sigma Seven. Cap Com. How do you read now?
Read you loud and clear, Deke. How me?
Much better. Got you through Grand Turk relay now.
Oh! How 'bout that. I'm now in auto reentry mode. Over.
Understand. Auto retro mode.
Negative. Auto reentry mode.
Roger. Understand. Reentry.
Roger. And she looks like she's really well lined up.
. . ..
Auto One this is Sigma Seven. I read you. How do you read me? Over.
This is Sigma Seven on VOX record only. I have reestablished auto mode in normal with no high thruster action. At this point I have 85 percent auto, 90 percent manual. And I feel, now that I am on ASCS, I can do some experiments where before I was not able to. I will now pitch the capsule down on fly-by-wire low. First I will check to see - if I turn on my beacons, nobody down here can get to me on those. At 6 hours and 25 minutes - if anybody has a beacon in South America they deserve to hear it. Beacons are on, for a good 3 amps. Opening visor to wipe off chin, and I think I'll take a drink of water.
Closing visor. Okay. Let's take a look and see where we are. At this point we made a dosimeter check. I will pitch down on fly-by-wire to reentry attitude. Now let's give it a manual proportional go this time.
In manual proportional, with manual lever pulled out, and having selected rate command. I'm slowly but surely coming into retroattitude. All axes are working very well. Setting up in roll. Getting yaw rates, pow, pow. And I want this to count - I'm going to go back to fly-by-wire low.
That was stupid. Now we go to fly-by-wire low. I had a case of double authority and really flotched it. But better conserve our fuel. It's much too easy to get into double authority, even with the tremendous logic you have working on all these systems. The pitch is in; yaw is in; selecting reentry attitude; roll is in; going to ASCS, reentry now. And she's in.
Okay. I think we can change backs, and get some weather bureau pictures if it's possible. Shoot up the rest - the rest of these, just lightly. That's A 10 at 6+30 hours, and 11 is coming up, and 6+30 hours with a cloud bank off to the left. Okay. I'll get the plate back on, and save this at A. Take the plate back out again, zap. Okay. That's wound up, A 12 to go.
The capsule at this point is, at 6 hours and 31 minutes, it is under chimp configuration. I've used manual proportional to a great degree. I now have 79 (percent) in manual (fuel) and 81 (percent) auto. Let's see how we stand. Ah, 81, 80 auto, 71 manual.
I fouled up, oh shucks.
That's clever. - Weather bureau back is finally out. First shot not worth using, so I'll change that. - Okay. We got slider out. Weather filter in, if I can get it. This side toward lens. There, we got a filter in. I'm going to shoot at ASA 64.
Take a light value at 06 35 minutes, and that light value is 13 for 64 ASA. Very good. Fairly bright, . . . I'll give her 13, and we'll punch off a couple quickies because of the first bad one. First shot taken at 6 35 25.
Second shot 6 35 45.
Capsule is in perfect attitude. Ideal shots for weather bureau. Think I even put on finder at this time. Shooting black and white of the clouds.
In the white. Ready to shoot at 6 -06 37 07. That was an oblique. Shot number 3. I'll take shot number 4 almost as straight down as I can sight. Beyond a little bit of shadow as we approach sunset. Okay, that was 6 37 34.
That's capsule elapsed time. At 6 38 we will copy the manual intermediate report and I can do that at this time.
Okay, at 6 hours and 35 minutes we are at 81 (percent auto fuel) - 79 (percent manual fuel). . . .cabin 90 (degrees). . . suit 63 (degrees) . . .. Dome 71 (degrees).
We're now at 6 40. Going to map two.
At this point, I made a complete electrical check. All electrical systems are green. The amps are about 19 amps. This is very logical after we've been inserted. The load has been diving over release of relays at T<sub>r</sub>+5.
All the equipment is in good order. Coming up over IOS for 6+50, in the night, and this time I want to go down the star charts to check this bear out. That is why I am on ASCS.
Had the fun with experimenting and now will get the fun of being ready for reentry at any time. Okay. Let's see - we got IOS at 6 40. 6 40. . . . same as 0 52.
There is a nice interesting horizon. The sun is off to the left about - oh I'd say 40 degrees. There's a dark line of the surface of the earth, orange at the clouds - a light yellow, a light white and a blue band. A very light blue and I have the Planet Mercury in sight at this point. Before the sun has set. And it's in the proper position.
Describing the blue band. There's a relatively dark blue band right at the surface of the earth, and a light blue band, and another dark blue band, and a large white band which is the air glow, and then a deep black one and sorta goes from a grayish blue in to a dense black. Almost looks like underneath a rain cloud as far as the transition from the blue band to the total darkness. And I'll bring up my fingertip lights. And at 06 45 52 Mercury is right on the horizon. Arcturus should be in view, but I guess we we can't get her.
Okay, I<sup>T</sup> see Mercury going through the - air glow. We'll see if she holds up. When I said, "I see" that was the beginning of it. MARK,<sup>T</sup> the first change of color, which is now a light blue. And it's still visible. MARK,<sup>T</sup> a darker blue. Visible MARK,<sup>T</sup> into the yellow orange of the surface of the earth. This was - Mercury, dropping over the horizon. I should be picking up the moon and Venus fairly soon. At 6 46 - and at 6 48 I'm over IOS.
Okay, it looks like we are getting some lighted areas over the southern tip of Africa. I definitely have a city in sight, and - this is Sigma Seven. On transmit, I've had on VOX record only. I definitely have a city in sight in Africa. It first showed up at 06 49 30 seconds. The lights come up very clear. I'm in retroattitude at this point to give a mark on my position, and the moon is on my flight path for yaw references
I'll bet you any money that city my left, and was Port Elizabeth.
Indian Ocean Cap Com this is Sigma Seven. Over.
Indian Ocean Cap Com. Sigma Seven. Over.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven. Unable to read your transmission. Over.
Indian Ocean Cap Com. Sigma Seven. Over.
Roger. I read you now. Over.
Roger. I read you weak.
Do you have a short report for me? Over.
Roger. I'll give you my configuration. I am in auto, retro control mode; gyros are normal; maneuver switch is off; all consumables are in the green; electrical is checking out very well; capsule is tracking well. The moon is perfect reference at this point, it is right on the predicted path as well as Venus, as you probably know from down there.
Roger. We have a CET. You have about a plus 3 second lead on your CET.
Would you give me a countdown on CET, please.
Roger. On my mark it will be 06 52 33. MARK<sup>T</sup>
That was 33 - that's about a 4 second difference. I see you have some good ole' lightning again.
Sigma Seven. Not to mention the word, but will you send a BP? (blood pressure) Over.
Okay.
This is IOS Cap Com. Standing by.
Roger. If you'll stand by I'm going to take a check on Venus, at this point, for extinction to see how she looks.
Roger.
Okay. Venus is extincted at 06 54 29, at a value of 5.2.
Seven. What was the time you stated?
I'm just recording data.
The standard light is also extincted at 3.8.
Picture taken, 06 56 27 black and white, of the moon. With the weather bureau filter pulled out. Picture number 6. And as the moon sets we'll try one more at a lower shutter speed. Trying to hold it carefully. That's the second picture taken of the moon at moon set. At this point the camera back will be reinstalled and the camera stowed in case of retro attempt.
Hello! - A pretty flash of light.
Camera is going to be stowed in the space dome.
. . ..
Auto beacons. Beacons are on power now. Camera is stowed.
Okay while I'm reading instruments, the 250 is 145 (degrees). That is the 250 inverter. The 150 inverter is 105 (degrees), and the standby inverter is 119 (degrees), retro temperature is 75 (degrees). Yaw right 100 (degrees), yaw left 90 (degrees), pitch down 96 (degrees), pitch up 102 (degrees), cabin heat exchanger 42 (degrees), roll left manual 98 (degrees), roll right auto 108 (degrees), roll left auto 108 (degrees), samey, samey. Very good. And this report was made at 07 04 40.
All systems look very good at this point. This is as tight a vehicle as anyone can imagine.
At 07 hours 10 minutes and 30 seconds, I see a lighted area. Very well lighted. - It shows up more like an airport. Better identify where that would be - that should be the Phillippines. Possibly it's at Zamboanga, and that's 07 hours 10 minutes and 30 seconds. Very graphic series of lights. Very easy to see.
Correction, at 07 hours and minutes put me over.
. . .. It's marked on the chart at 07 hours and 10 minutes. I was looking down at - almost in retroattitude. It showed up very clearly.
Now we're getting a planet in sight. Roger. Jupiter. I can see a string of stars for Grus, and good ole' Formalhaut - there in the upper corner, Grus coming down through the middle. And Formalhaut coming right down middle. Very good.
All attitudes seem to be checking out very well. Head and couch with scribe line works. My reticle at this, quick check on it.
Unable to dim reticle sufficiently for a night acquisition. MARK again Grus that is, of the stars themselves in the window. . . .. Thaurus is coming right down through the center line. Could yaw right about 5 degrees which would satisfy dead reckoning. Then roll left about 5 (degrees) which is quite graphic. For retro, this looks like a very good set-up. Be no problem at all flying attitude here with the moon bright . . . light which would be dawn's light. Occasionally you can see a ground light, particularly, along the island chain at this point.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is PCS Com Tech, PCS Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
This is Sigma Seven. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Roger. Sigma Seven. Reading you 5 by, 5 by. Going to Cap Com.
Roger.
Hello Seven. Standing by for your report.
Roger, Al. I am in auto; retro; the gyro switches are normal; maneuver is off. The capsule is prepared for retrosequence but for stowing two charts. I'm sure we're go. I have 81 percent auto, (fuel) 80 percent manual (fuel), which is the same as my intermediate report. They did not change. I have 52 (psi, in hundreds) on primary, 75 (psi, in hundreds) on secondary oxygen. Suit is go at 62 (degrees). Same as before.
Roger, Seven. I did not catch your manual fuel reading. You broke up a little bit. Will you give that to me please?
Roger. Manual is 80 (percent).
Roger. I have 81 (percent) auto, 80 (percent) manual, oxygen 5,200 (psi) and 7,500 (psi).
That is correct.
Well, I would say you were definitely go. We are out of contact with the Cape at the moment, but looks like you are good for the full route.
Right you are. Now my CET, I guess, is about 3 seconds fast, as you know.
Roger. Why don't you give me a time hack on it?
Okay. I'll give you a 35. MARK 35.<sup>T</sup>
Roger. You are about 3 seconds fast. I show your TORF (time of retrofire) as 08 Volume 1 21.
Roger. That is what I have in.
Your T/M on CET is also 2 seconds fast. The retrosequence for (contingency recovery area) 5-Echo is nominal.
Roger. 5 Echo, Al. It's a real ball.
Man - sound like you're really enjoying it. I'll give you a few seconds of silence while I send through a calibration.
Okay.
Seven this is Cap Com.
Roger. I see you are still on R Cal.
Affirmed. The R Cal is now off.
Roger. I have it coming off.
We've been comparing the free surface effect of liquid on the center of gravity of the capsule, and we recommend that you drain the bilges prior to reentry.
Ha! Ha! Ha!
It's during the coming orbit.
I'm concur.
Also, Seven. At LOS, which should occur about 07 21, the typhoon will be located about 400 miles about 45 degrees left of your track. So you should be able to pick it up.
Oh, very good. I'll look for it.
And we are reading you loud and clear and will be standing by for your HF check at 7 20.
Roger.
If you have nothing further, I'll see you next time.
Okay. I'll drop in.
Standing by.
Roger, Al. Thanks a lot.
Gyros are free.
Seven. PCS.
This is Sigma Seven. On HF. This is Sigma Seven. On HF. Giving a short count at 07 hours, 20 minutes, 34 seconds CET. This is to check for HF coverage on the world wide range. The duration of the transmission is to last 60 seconds. I wish I knew what else I could say to eat up the time. If I breathe hard enough this might help. The capsule is working very well and I believe we are just about coming up on the end of a 60 second mark. Using HF transmit and record throughout the world wide range. And this is Sigma Seven. Checking out.
Seven this is PCS. Do you still read?
That is affirmative on HF. How do you read me, Al?
Loud and clear, Wally. Could you, if you have time, give us a readout on how you are coming on your orientation tests? Over.
I seem to be improving. What I am touching is just these three items, but I get closer to them each time I whack at it.
Very good. The head shrinkers will be delighted.
I guess they are out of a job altogether.
Okay Wally san. See you next time.

Negative. Everything here is going honky dory. Apparently I am committed for six and I am very happy about it. The whole rig is running beautifully. In case Al couldn't relay my fuels. I have 81 (percent) auto, 80 (percent) manual, - I am in auto, retro control mode at this point.
Okay. I am in auto, retro control mode at this point. - Gyros are free for the scanner test.

Roger, Gus. I've been reading you for a long time. Over.
Ah, that is good. We lost all contact with you. I have correct retrosequence time for (recovery) area 6-1. Are you ready to copy?
Stand by 1 second here.
Are you ready to copy retrosequence time, Wally?
Okay, go.
Roger, 08 51 27.
Roger, 08 51 27.
That's correct.
Okay.
Give me your status.
Roger. My status is go. I could receive all the stations in the Pacific, but they apparently weren't receiving me. Would you advise them to transmit in the blind. I had very good communications with the Pacific Command Ship.
You say you had good communications with PCS?
That is affirmative. Ideal.
Roger. You are cutting out here. It's difficult to understand you. That's good communications with PCS?
That is affirmative.
Roger. Roger.
I could hear Watertown, Huntsville, and you, loud and clear all the time.
Roger.
I still have ample fuel. The capsule is tracking beautifully in auto, retro mode. I have 81 (percent) auto and 80 (percent) manual.
Wally.
Go ahead.
Would you reset your clock?
Roger. To 08 51 27. Standby. Roger, it is set to 08 51 27. Do you concur?
Roger. I have that setting.
Roger.
When you take into account your error in CET, it should be set at 08 51 31, Cape advises.
Roger. This means I have to punch retrosequence. Right?
Will you give us a blood pressure?
Roger.
Wally, give me a CET.
Roger. I have - I'll give you 45. MARK <sup>T</sup> 45 seconds. That's 07 hours, 35 minutes 45 seconds. Did you read, Gus?
Wally, we lost you. I think your transmitter is fading out. I'll give you a CET at 07 36 10. MARK 07 36 10. (Computed mark garbled, unobtainable)
Roger. I got your mark. I am 4 seconds fast. Did you read Hawaii?
Hawaii Cap Com. I am 4 seconds fast. Sigma Seven transmitting in the blind.
Hello Sigma Seven, hello Sigma Seven this is Cal Cap Com, Cal Cap Com. Broadcasting in the blind. We have had a power failure on our receiver. I am broadcasting in the blind. Reset your clock for retrosequence at 08 51 33. This takes into account your clock error at last readout. You had last report had 27 seconds set in. This should be 33 by last CET check we had with you. Cape wants you to reset that at 33. This is Cal broadcasting in the blind,
Roger, Cal. I have set in 05 - correction, 08 hours, 51 minutes, 33 seconds. Guaymas Cap Com, do you read? Over.
Guaymas Cap Com. Sigma Seven. Over.
Sigma Seven this is Cal Cap Com. Repeating broadcast in the blind. Cape advises reset your clock to 08 51 and 33 seconds, and 33 seconds. Cal out.
Sigma Seven this is Cal Cap Com, in the blind again. Make sure face plate is closed. Face plate closed.
All right. This is - Sigma Seven - this is Cal. We have your change on T/M of 08 51 and 33, showing good. This is correct setting.
Sigma Seven this is Guaymas Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Guaymas. How do you read me? Over.
Roger. Sigma Seven. Guaymas Cap Com. Loud and clear. They had a power failure up the California way. We're reading your correct retrosequence time 08 51 33. On my mark, let see, your capsule elapsed time is at this moment 4 seconds fast, Wally. This - this takes into effect this error. Over.
Roger, Scott. I understand. Excuse me. Just finished my beef and vegetables. I am in good shape up here. I have had good communications with Al. The clock is set properly. The capsule is tracking well.
Roger. Very good. Remember to close your face plate at this time. Remember also do it prior to reentry.
Roger. I have done that.
Okay, at this time.
Roger. Face plate is closed and I have had a navel maneuver.
Roger.
Everything looks real good, Scott.
It looks real good down here Wally. Doing a good job and we are looking forward to seeing you shortly at Midway way.
Roger. We'll get some boat duty in too.
Scott. Do you have horizon scans on me?
Roger. Wait one, Wally.
I would like to have you check my roll attitude.
Roger. CET on my mark will be 7 hours, 44 minutes, 30 seconds. MARK.<sup>T</sup>
What? Is that right? That's what my clock says.
Right. That was CET. The Cape asked for that. We are showing 4 seconds behind you Wally.
Oh, okay. That was right on. Now what is my roll attitude on your scanner?
Okay. Your roll scanner shows minus - minus - minus 10 (degrees), Wally.
Roger. I concur. Believe I am a little bit steeper than 10 (degrees) left. I'll bring that out with the manual axes and then let her fly it again. And see what she does.
Wally. How about one more blood pressure before you leave?
Roger. Standby.
Sigma Seven. On my mark, the ground elapsed time will be 7 hours, 45 minutes, 40 seconds. Standby. MARK.<sup>T</sup>
Roger. I concur.
Roger.
Going to fly-by-wire low at this point. Manual lever in. The capsule attitudes appear to be very good.
That's fly-by-wire low at this time. Sigma Seven?
That's correct. I just want to check this roll out during the daylight side. Pitch is real honest and so is yaw. I think I've got to correct about 6 degrees worth of roll though.
Roger. Gyros are normal? Is that correct?
That's correct.
Wally, we also show a gyro free position on the ground.
Roger. I just went to that free. Standby.
Roger. And do you plan to return to ASCS shortly?
Momentarily.
Roger.
Just coming on to it.
Okay. Stop the blood pressure. We got a good one, Wally.
Okay. Stand by - normal ASCS.
Roger. We're reading - gyros normal.
Roger. The scanner test was what the problem was. And the roll went off as we anticipated it would. And I am going back to gyros normal, at this time, which is about 2 minutes early. This is the routine that was on the flight plan, if you'll see it.
Roger.
Okay, we should pick up this roll problem that I had there now that we've got the scanners back on the line. Looked pretty good for pitch though, it's beautiful.
Roger. And the gyros are showing, at this time, only a 4 degree difference, and that is decreasing.
Roger. That's the deal. That's what I wanted you to check for me while I was over your station, Scott. Thank you. So it looks like the ASCS is pure. I am now in -
Scanners are also in agree - pitch scanners in agreement with your gyros, and we have T/M LOS.
Roger. I'm happy here.
This is Sigma Seven. A 30 second HF check, at 07 50 minutes commencing at 10 seconds after that. This is a 30 second duration test, as I pass down through the coast of Baja California, enroute to South - South America. Every system is working very properly. I have 5 more seconds of check to go. Test out. Sigma Seven. Switching to UHF for relay.
Sigma Seven. Cape Com Tech. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Cape Com Tech. I read you loud and clear. How me?
Cape Com Tech. Sigma Seven. How do you read, UHF relay?
Cape Com Tech. Sigma Seven. On UHF. Over.
UHF relay is good. Do you read? Over.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven. Cape Com Tech, Cape Com Tech broadcasting 1 2 3 4 5 4 3 2 1. How do you read? Over.
I read you loud and clear, Murph. How do you read me? Over.
Hello, Quito. This is Sigma Seven. Can you relay to Cape that I read them loud and clear? Over.
Yes, you are coming through fine. Any traffic you have, be glad to take it. Go ahead.
Everything here is all set. Would you relay to the Cape, I have everything under control. We are all set here.
Very fine. Thank you very much. You don't have any word to pass on? Can you say anything in Spanish to the fellows down here?
I'm afraid I can't. Except I would like to come down and visit you. I'm enjoying a beautiful sight of the country.
Certainly nice to hear that, but could you say just a few greetings to them? They would appreciate it so much. They want to put you on their radio down here.
I must send my greetings to the other people of our same area. The fact that we are two hemispheres joined is even proven today by our capability of flying over each other's countries realizing that we are one and the same.
Would you say, "Buenas dias," or something like that back to them?
Right, all I can do on that now is say, Buenas dias you-all.
Ha, ha. Thank you so much. I think they'll love that.
Would you relay to Cape Com Tech - Cape Com Tech that I can read him?
Who can you read?
Would you relay to Cape Canaveral Com Tech that I read him.
That you do read Cape Canaveral right now?
That's affirmative.
Okay, will tell him. Thank you a lot.
Sigma Seven. Affirmative.
Sigma Seven this is Cape Com Tech. This is Cape Com Tech. How do you read? Over.
Sigma Seven. Loud and clear.
This is Sigma Seven. Affirmative. I do read.
Sigma Seven, Cape Com Tech UHF/HF. How do you read?
Sigma Seven. Loud and clear.
Were you calling Quito or Cape Com?
Trying to talk to the Cape. But apparently they don't realize I am still talking. Quito, I can hear them all loud and clear.
This is Sigma Seven. We don't a transmitter exercise. I do read 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1. Sigma Seven. Out. I'm tired of carrying on Com.
At 7 hours, 59 minutes, 10 seconds, light value reading, for the black and white film, is 13 for ASA 64. Setting light value of 13. Taking picture number 7 with filter. The continent of South America is difficult to photograph because of all the weather. I will take a panorama at this time. Starting at 7 59 almost 8 hours. In fact, it will be 8 hours. MARK<sup>T</sup>, 7, 8, 9 black photographs, black and white film. Ten photographs, black and white film. The shots are being taken at 250 5.6 (1/250 second and f5.6) at infinity. Taking number 11, looking to the left. I am coming across the South American continent at this point. I have a large river in sight. Take a picture, camera facing down as much as possible. I believe I got the capsule window very nicely there. I'll come back to - B-1 now. I've shot the 12 first pictures. I'm on B-1, shooting at the cloud streaks. I've shot B-2 and these are all black and white shots, with weather bureau filter in at 08 02. I will take the last pictures of this series. That is the end of the weather bureau pictures. I believe we've taken enough to satisfy the requirements. Pulling out the filter. Restoring the slide to the back. Removing black back.
Bring out color back. Taking a light value reading of the South American continent at 08 04 commencing, - gotta change the ASA number. ASA number changed to 160. Light value being measured at this time. Light value is 15.
Very interesting terrain pictures. I will take one of the horizon just for posterity. At this time, that picture was A number 12, resetting to B and now have B-1. Taking some colored pictures of the South American continent. I don't think we'll have much luck with them.
That was at B-2. Coming up on B-3. Pitch down at this time to approximately 10 degrees. The roll error that developed during the period where we had the scanners off has disappeared. At this point, I am going to increase the suit flow to approximately- just a tad to increase the cooling for reentry. See if I can bring it down a little bit more. There is almost perfect attitude. Yaw is good. Pitch is down a little steep. It's definite that the yaw reticle is not good for night work.
I'm going to stow the camera now for the check on the Durban light. As we did not have any luck with the flare.
Camera is stowed. Photometer is light enough to take out and leave out. I will make another check on a low-level gadget here before we terminate. And it has gone up about the thickness of one line. Is now reading 0.06 that is less than 0.1. All of these will now be stowed in the glove box; they have been on the hatch, adjacent to the hatch detention spring nearest the emergency rate handle. In a vertical plane parallel to the bag that holds the extra goodies that can't be shoved other places.
At 08 hours and 10 minutes. Going to pitch up to reentry attitude shortly. No reason to keep glove box open at this time. Have to get the standard source of light, I may be able to get it. Put that away in a hurry. That'll stay there. That is the yaw cover. Everything else is ready.
Skies are getting darker.
Fly-by-wire low and pitching up to reentry attitude. Going to fly-by-wire low, now<sup>T</sup>.
Attitude okay. Pitching back down to reentry attitude, correction retroattitude. No reason to stay at reentry attitude. No reason to stay at reentry attitude, when we can see so well in retroattitude. And this is truly the attitude we need to fly. Coming up on retroattitude. Roll checks out. Yaw checks out. Reentry attitude is on select. Stopping pitch shortly. (Pitch is drifting in very slowly). Pitch is stopped - on pitch. Going to ASCS auto, gyros are normal, maneuver is off.
Closed face plate. Opened it momentarily, merely to wipe my nose, and try to clear a lens, which I cannot do. Reentry select. Camera is stowed. I will now extinct the standard light source - and cannot move the cabin light on the starboard side; therefore, I will extinct it as a continual reference. There, it is now extinct, at 3.3. Cabin source extincted at 3.3 at 08 hours 15 minutes and 35 seconds CET.
Fly-by-wire low did check out very well.
Moving suit setting to 8 at this time. That is the suit coolant quantity settings to 8. Suit inlet is now 65 (degrees), which is comfortable. In fact, I was quite cool before, but I'd like to get cool again. And the dome is about 73 (degrees).
Cabin is all set, I don't want to lower the dome any more. It's been very good. Checking on time 18 minutes. Okay on the clock. Thrusters - roll left auto is 119 (degrees). Roll right auto is 115 (degrees). Roll left manual is 100 (degrees). Cabin heat exchanger is 43 (degrees). Pitch up auto is 95 (degrees). Pitch down auto is 95 (degrees). Yaw left auto is 80 (degrees). Yaw right auto 100 (degrees). 250 inverter, oh how nice, less than 160 (degrees). The 150 inverter - is 110 (degrees). Standby is 125 (degrees). Turning to cabin heat exchanger.
Checking out d-c volts at this time. Main bus 24 (volts), isolated bus 27½ (volts), one is 25 (volts). Two is 25 (volts). Three is 25 (volts). Standby one is 25 (volts), standby two is 25 (volts), isolated is 28 (volts). Back to main. ASCS and fans are both 115 (volts). Drawing 20 amps. Oxygen remaining 50 (psi, in hundreds) primary, 75 (psi, in hundreds) secondary.
Will perform an orientation test at this time while I'm on ASCS and not so busy. Reaching for manual handle - and on it, exactly on it. Reaching for yaw attitude. I hit it at 20 degrees, right 20 degrees. Reaching for emergency handle. Right on it, negative, that one - slightly off touched the side of the box first. I didn't hit it exactly, I'm sure. That is completion of the orientation test.
I have the moon in sight. There is Venus. The moon is tracking beautifully. Right on in yaw, right on in pitch, right on in roll. All three axes are very beautiful.
Seems so sad just a little less than a half an hour left to play with this. I am now going to fly-by-wire low. Gyros free, to pitch down to observe the Durban light. Gyros free, fly-by-wire low, correction, I am going to manual proportional at this point. I have not charged any rates so I will go back to ASCS. Clean. Over to rate command. Manual proportional out. I will try this mode out for size. Down a very small amount, 23 minutes.
Indian Ocean Ship this is Sigma Seven. Do you read? Over.
Indian Ocean Ship. Sigma Seven. Do you read? Over.
Indian Ocean Ship. Sigma Seven. Do you read? Over.
Indian Ocean Ship. Sigma Seven. Do you read? Over.
. . . how do you read? Over.
Indian Ocean Ship. Sigma Seven. Do you read? Over.
Roger, Sigma Seven. Read you 5 by 5.
Roger, Indian Ocean Ship. Have not seen the flare. I am pitching back up to retroattitude.
Roger. Were you able to check the Durban lights?
I mean the Durban lights. I was not able to see them. I see some lights on the ground - at this time - in the middle of the window, which is just about the time for the Durban lights. They are underneath clouds and are not good enough for complete recognition. Over.
. . . short report.
Say again. Over.
Could you give us a short report? Over.
Roger. I am back in - retroattitude. I'm going back to chimpanzee configuration. The gyros are normal. Everything is stowed but the photometer, which will be stowed shortly.
Roger.
I have set my suit circuit cooling valve to position number 8 just to precool a little bit, and it is working properly.
Roger. Can we have one more blood pressure at this time? Over.
Roger. Coming up.
Sigma Seven. Did you say that your att - your mode was ASCS retro?
I'm coming to that just now.
Roger.
I have the moon setting at this point.
Say again.
The moon just set. And I have lightning in sight over this area.
Roger. Are you about ready to go through your pre-retrosequence checklist?
That's affirmative. Just stand by 1 second. Will go to ASCS.
Okay.
Okay, ready for pre-retrosequence checklist.
Do you want some help with it?
Say again.
Do you want some help with the checklist?
Negative. I am in attitude at this time. I will give you the rest of the checklist for your reading.
Roger. Would you push to stop blood pressure, please.
Roger. Have got that done. I've got attitude select retro.
Roger.
I've got retro correction thrusters on - normal instead of low. I'm going to switch to HF antenna to bicone although I'm using UHF - at this time.
Roger.
I am on bicone, and the visor is closed. All other items are in their proper position. Over.
Roger.
Checklist complete except for squib switch arm.
Roger. Could you give us a cabin pressure and suit readout?
Roger. Standby. The cabin pressure is 4.9 (psi) almost 5. The suit temperature inlet is 63 (degrees). The cabin temperature is 92 (degrees).
Sigma Seven. Say again cabin pressure. Did not read you.
Cabin pressure is 5., 5.0 (psi).
Roger.
I am warming up gyros although they should have a bypass anyway.
Sigma Seven. Everything looks good. IOS standing by.
Roger, IOS. It looks good here.
Sigma Seven. We have 1 minute to LOS.
Roger, I am completely secure here and ready for retrofire on command.
Roger.
All attitudes check out perfectly here. How do they check with you there?
This is Sigma Seven. I will check fly-by-wire high thrusters at this time.
. . ..
. . ..
At this time, I have completed the high thruster checks. A delayed report. Each axis worked beautifully. I now have 75 (percent) auto (fuel) and 75 (percent) manual (fuel).
All attitudes are responding very nicely. Suit heat dome is about 72 (degrees), suit inlet is about 63 (degrees), coming down just a tad. Definitely it - optimum flight setting of about 7½ to 8 for this vehicle. I will crack it up another notch to 8. I have set the - suit regulator for the coolant quantity to position 8, at CET 08 36 23.
That's a more accurate reading on fuel if I can get my fingers up to it would be 78, 78 (percent) - prior to retro. I am set up to have retro performed - automatic control - subsequent to retro - I will switch to fly-by-wire and pitch up to reentry axis - correction - subsequent to retro jettison, switch to fly-by-wire, pitch up reentry attitude and select rate command at 08 . . ..
Cabin, at this time, is monitoring at about 4.8 (psi). The suit apparently about 4 (psi), and the suit pressure gage is reading 4.9 (psi). This is the suit pressure gage on the suit.
The index finger - finger-tip light left hand finally failed. They really do not have the long-time durability that we're looking for.
The horizon is very clear. Roll and pitch look very good. Yaw looks good. I believe we've got a medley of stars coming into sight now to give us a fix.
One gets the illusion that you're on a train or some other vehicle, due to the humming, and you feel that you should be on a track of some kind and you're driving down. Much like the sound of the ship when you're under way at sea. The blower noise, I assume, and the inverters give you the same illusions
Okay. We got Grus, and we got Jupiter in the right position. So our yaw reference is right on the money. No problem with that. When I lean way down I can pick up Jupiter, and Formalhaut should come down very shortly after.
Have a slight roll to the right, which is indicated by the gyro as well. Coming on 8 minutes and 50 seconds.
T<sub>r</sub>-10 relay must have set in, although I have no clues - other than the ASCS rate gyros coming up and I can't bet on those since they're in anyway by the switch being selected to T<sub>r</sub>-10 bypass.
Gyros normal. Attitude - fly-by-wire. Retrofire armed, the 3 fuses are armed. We are fat!
There is Jupiter,and there is Formalhaut in the middle of the window, this time around. Attitude is real stiff now. Just by chance, I assume. Roll is right on, yaw is right on.
Cabin PO<sub>2</sub> at this time is about 3.9 to 4.0 (psi). Cabin heat exchanger is about 50 (degrees), at this time. Dome just happens to be on an upswing now.
Dome, cabin dome is about 57 (degrees). Cabin temperature is 90 (degrees). Suit inlet is 62 (degrees). Oxygen remaining 50 (psi, in hundreds) primary, 75 (psi, in hundreds) secondary. All electrical looks good. Fuel remaining, still is, 78, 78 (percent).
Coming up on the 5 minute to go to retrograde light.
Five minute to go retrograde light is on.
Attitude looks very good, nice and stiff. Pressure is holding very well. Vehicle looks very good.
Roll left, not so good. Let's see what we have. Five degrees roll shows up very readily.
Checking over the other systems. They all seem to be fairly constant. Suit dome is still about 71 (degrees), suit inlet is 62 (degrees), which this time is comfortable. Cabin pressure and suit pressure and suit pressure gauge all match within about 1/10 of a psi. Getting some light in the periscope at this time.
About 2 minutes to go to retrofire. I'm in UHF-hi, transmit and record, R/T. All fuse switches are in the proper position but for the landing switch fuses.
Here comes some sunlight.
Pacific Command Ship this is Sigma Seven. Do you read? Over.
Sigma Seven this is Pacific Command Ship. Do you read? Over.
Affirmative, Seven. Are you reading me?
Roger, Al. Read you loud and clear.
Understand you're ready to go home, Wally.
Roger. I've got everything all set, Al, except for the squib switch, which I'll put on your count.
Very good. You're going to use ASCS retro, and manual proportional standby.
That is affirmative. The handle is sitting in at this time; I'll pull it out.
Okay. Your attitudes look very good, Wally, and your clock is 5 seconds fast. - So with the present setting, we should time out right on time.
Roger, Al. I've got - I'm coming up on 30 seconds to go. I'll give you my light.
Okay.
I've got the 5 minute light on. This is the 30 second light - 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, LIGHT<sup>T</sup> There it is. I've got a light and a tone. Tone is out.
Very good. The timing is right on, Wally. I'll count down to retrosequence, and you'll arm the squibs at 5.
That's correct.
Here we go at 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5.
Squib arm.
3, 2, 1. SEQUENCE<sup>T</sup>.
I have sequence, and capsule is nice and tight. Got attitude green. She sitting here like a tight rock, Al.
Roger, attitude looks very good from here, Wally.
Yeah. They looked beautiful here, too. Oh boy! She's a good little capsule, I'll clue you.
Here you go.
Roger.
5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0.<sup>T</sup>
I've got (retro rocket number) 1, and she's holding real tight. Very tight. I got 2, my attitudes are right on the money. I've got 3.
Very good. We confirm on T/M. Retros 1, 2, and 3. Attitudes holding very well. Retro jettison switch to arm.
Roger.
Emergency retro jettison fuse switch is on.
Roger. They are all on. Retro jet is armed. Got sunlight. Everybody's very happy. I'm going to fly-by-wire, Al, to pitch to reentry attitude. Manual is going in.
And we show you have about 68 percent auto and 84 percent manual fuel left. I think our readings are probably a little closer than yours.
I've got 68 (percent) auto and 78 (percent) manual.
Roger.
Standing by for retro jett. I have retro jett, and light is green. I could hear it by the way.
Very good. We confirm retro jettison.
Okay. I am using fly-by-wire low to pitch up to reentry attitude.
Okay. We're following you here.
Roger. I am a little sloppy on the roll as you may see. No strain. I'm going to put her right into ASCS when I get up here. Okay. She's in reentry as far as roll goes. Okay. The scope is coming in. I'm on the gyros.
Roger. We confirm scope retract on T/M.
Roger.
And you're very close to reentry attitude.
Roger. I'm in reentry attitude now.
Roger. Understand you will go to RSCS prior to 0.05g, with aux damp as a back up.
That is affirmative. I'm now going to ASCS at this time. And she's tight and holding.
Understand you are in ASCS.
That is correct. I want to see if the reentry logic was in.
Roger. And you will go to RSCS prior to 0.05g.
That is correct, Al. I want to give her a checkout. Those retros were real cute, and right on the money.
Roger.
I'd say attitudes didn't vary 1 degree.
Real tight. Real tight.
Righto. I think they're gonna put me on number 3 elevator.
Ha, ha. Good show. Stand by I'll call the Cape. See if they have anything.
Okay, Al.
Okay. Post retro, I read 65 (percent) auto (fuel), and about - 78 (percent) manual (fuel). Manual lever is in. I'm in ASCS at this time.
Understand you are still in ASCS but the manual lever is in.
That is correct. What is my nominal time for 0.05g.
Standing by Wally. We have LOS. See you later.
Roger, Al.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Watertown Com Tech. UHF. How do you read?
Roger. Watertown Com Tech this is Sigma Seven. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Sigma Seven this is Watertown Com Tech. I read you weak, I read you weak. Please make another transmission.
Roger. I read you loud and clear, Watertown. How do you read me now?
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Watertown Com Tech. I read you broken up. I read you broken up. Please make another transmission.
Roger, Watertown. I read you loud and clear. Please make your transmissions to me in the blind, if I do not acknowledge.
Sigma Seven, Sigma Seven this is Watertown Com Tech. I read you 3 by 3. Stand by, I'll turn you over to Com - Cap Com.
Roger.
Sigma Seven this is Watertown Cap Com.
Roger. Watertown Cap Com. How do you read me?
Weak and unreadable, at the moment. But I will transmit in the blind. Please check to make sure your face plate is closed and sealed. Do you read?
Roger. Face plate closed and sealed.
Will you verify that your scope is fully retracted and the door closed. Does it look dark?
The scope is retracted, and I think you'll have to confirm that for me.
Understand - I just barely understood you, but I'll go ahead. Will you confirm that the UHF/DF switch is in the R/T position.
That is correct.
I am standing by to check out my RSCS mode at the proper time.
Sigma Seven. Did not understand the last transmission but assume you read that we should have UHF/DF switch in the R/T position. I do not have any landing recovery information for you at the moment, but I'll pass it on to you if I can.
Roger. Have you acquired track?
Expect LOS blackout anytime. I'll keep transmitting in the hope that it will get it on your tape recorder.
Roger.
At main chute deploy if you get a chance, will you shut off your three water controls to help out the data reduction people?
Wilco. If I get a chance. Ha, ha.
Sigma Seven. Don't forget to watch your your cabin pressure and your altimeter. If they do not check, pull your decompress or your snorkle handle.
Roger. Understand.
Sigma Seven. I'll keep on talking in the hope that we can clear this blackout problem. At 17K, your O<sub>2</sub> emergency light should come on. At that time pull your snorkle.
Roger. Understand.
You should have sent your blood pressure.
I did.
I still have you on T/M. No blackout yet.
Roger. I'm going to check out rate command at this time.
Roger. Understand. Checking out rate command.
Sigma Seven. Do you still read?
Sigma Seven. Read you loud and clear. How me?
Clear.
Roger.
Wally, by the way, how do you feel? All your systems okay at this time?
Oh, they're beautiful - very good. Every control mode has worked perfectly.
Lost you on T/M.
Roger.
I have selected aux damp and rate command at this. The window is almost completely occluded. It would be impossible to see out of it at this point.
I'm seeing things come off, but I can't see them very clearly. There we go into 0.05, a green. I am hands off at this point. In rate command, in aux damp. And I have a roll rate started. A slight pitch rate, not bad at all. I can see out the window for some strange reason at last. There goes another long spiral like looking device. I will give another blood pressure at this point, subsequent to 0.05 g. All rates are very nominal. Rate command is working quite well I would say.
Going back into g-field. And the attitude looks very stable. I'm rolling right around the horizon. I'm going to stop my blood pressure at this time - and sit back here and regroup. I can see the ion layer. I'm inverted at this time.
Attitudes are controlling very well. Seems to be plenty of manual fuel. I'm still at 72 percent. Definitely has the cyclic rate in pitch at this point. Yaw is fairly stiff; g is building up. Capsule is quite stable. There is a green flow - and looks like orange streaks every once in a while. RSCS is doing very well on reentry. Rather unusual slow roll. Building up to 2g's. I have plenty of fuel in rate command. Seeing sparkles coming by now. A definite green glow, like a limeade; g's building up. Oscillations are very good at this point. About 3g.
Still in a relatively horizontal attitude. Rate command working well. Glad she's holding. Doing very well. Coming up to 5½ (g). Rate command still holding, fuel is still 70 (percent), seems low. Coming up to 6½ (g), 7g's. Coming up to 8g. Rate command holding. Taking a pretty big yaw out. Not too bad, I have it pretty well. Manual (fuel) is 60 percent. She's flying it very well.
Coming off. Peak-g was an indicated 7½ (g).
I read you weak. How do you read?
Roger. Read you well, loud and clear. - I still have about 3g on. Capsule performing very well. Rate command holding pretty well. Altimeter off the peg. Attitudes holding very well.
Sigma Seven this is Hawaii Cap Com.
Roger. Go ahead.
Everything appears to be nominal.
Roger. Seems nominal here. Everything looks good. Got 55 percent auto fuel. Passing through 70,000 feet, 65,000. Attitudes are very stable. Coming up on 60 (thousand). Rate command doing very well. Coming up on 50 (thousand). She looks like a sweety. Coming up on 45,000. I'm down to about 1 g. Preparing to punch the drogue, at 40, 41 (thousand). I'm punching drogue, and the drogue is out. You can hear it; I can't see it because of the clouds. Attitudes are holding well. Manual lever is in. RSCS fuel is going pretty fast. I can see the drogue now. Drogue looks very good. I'm going to aux damp to. Actually don't need it. Rate command is burning itself out. And aux damp is doing nothing, just sitting there. I'll put in auto mode just to let her pump out.
- about 3 seconds.
Roger, I'm coming down on 20,000. Standing by for snorkle. Cabin pressure is increasing. Snorkle should go. I believe snorkle lid blew. I felt them I will pull it anyway. I have an emergency rate. I think I led the snorkle a little bit on that one.
I'm dumping H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Switch fuse on. Standing by. Recovery arm is "arm". Standing by for main chute. All switches are in proper position. Manual fuel is almost all gone. There goes drogue and main is out. It's - she's out beautiful. Bright blue sky. And it's dereefed, and looks like a sweety pie. Auto fuel is dumping. Rate of descent is about 35 (fps) at this time. I see no problems at all. I'm going to get prepared for impact. Auto fuel is dumping out. Cabin pressure is increasing properly. All systems look real good. I am cool, I am not hot. Main chute looks delightful. Rate of descent is 35 feet per second. I have no reason to select anything else. Landing bag is out.
Roger, Wally. How do you feel?
I feel marvelous. This is a beautiful flight, wasn't it?
Understand, you feel marvelous.
That is affirmative. I'm opening visor at this time to relieve my ears?
Did you get the weather in the recovery area?
I probably had too much to say. What do you fellows have?
Roger. Weather is 2,000 broken, visibility 10 miles, 3 foot seas. We don't have any tracked IP yet but you should be very close to the Kearsarge.
Roger. Sounds good, Gus. It's a beautiful chute here. I want to get a good description out before we got into the - the drink here. I'm preparing for impact by disconnecting the visor hose.
What's your altitude, Wally?
Say again.
Altitude?
I'm now at about 6,000 feet.
Understand, 6,000.
That's correct. I'm not rolling at all on this chute. Okay I've got that darn visor hose off, and the Velcro strap loose. Visor seal is dumped. I take off the exit hose from the helmet - and stuff that up in the toolies. I'm not even hot here, Gus.
You say it's hot.
I am not hot. I am very comfortable.
Say again here. Just don't read.
I am very comfortable.
Talk slow. You come in clear then.
Roger. I am very comfortable.
Very good. We understand.
I want to stay aboard.
. . ..
I am turning off ASCS bus. I'm going to get rid of these coolant valves that the fellows wanted, they're all going to 0. And I hear the aux beacon already.
. . ..
I am about ready to impact now. I'm just about on the water.
Oh! stay dry baby.
Okay. It's taking a while to right itself but I think I've got the small end out of the water here. Can you read? Over.
Roger. Sigma Seven. Flag Plot. Are you stable and on the water?
Looks like I'm stable on the water. The whip antenna is up. I can see it. I will switch to whip antenna.
I am definitely canted over pretty far, but there seems to be no water in the capsule, and I am very comfortable. She is righting herself very nicely, at this time.
Roger. Carrier has you visual and the helos are on their way.
How about that? That's great.
Do you still feel better?
Oh! I always feel better. There, she's getting nice and straight now.
Say again, Wally.
She's getting up there nice and straight now.
Talk very slowly. I have difficulty reading.
Okay. She's almost erect in the water at this time. I'm going to put up the whip antenna, Gus, and turn the squibs off. Standby.
I'm sorry, Wally. I didn't read that.
Okay. I have put the whip antenna up, and I'm turning off the arm squibs.
Whip antenna is up. You're turning off the squib arm.
That is correct.
Okay. I'm going to check the cockpit, to be sure we don't get the boys in trouble. Everything looks real good, Gus. This is a real sweetie pie of a capsule.
Roger. I agree.
I am in comfort, absolute complete comfort. The suit inlet is now 72 (degrees), the cabin is about 98 (degrees). That's all. I feel very comfortable.
Roger. Repeat the last part before the very comfortable.
The suit inlet temperature is 72 - 72 (degrees). The cabin temperature is 98 - 98 (degrees). I'm going to retract the scope manually to get it out of the way for the boys when they come around.
Wally. You landed about 9,000 yards from the carrier. How about that?
That's pretty close isn't it?
Boy this is a sweet little bird. I just can't get over it.
Wally. Hawaii Cap Com.
Go ahead.
Recovery has been advised of your status. You're comfortable. They see the whip antenna, and they are on the way.
Very good. I am very comfortable.
Hello Astro, Hello Astro this is Swiss One. How do you read me. Over.
Roger. Swiss One this is Astro. How are you today?
Fine, fine. Got your squibs off. Give me a short count, please.
Roger. A short count follows 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1. This is Astro. Sigma Seven. Very happy to be back in the Pacific league.
Good. Glad to be able to talk to you.
Oh, it's a good habit.
Hello Astro this is Swiss One. We have you on sight. You're looking good from here, on the green dye.
Roger, I seem to be bathing in it, don't I?
Roger. I'm going to fly overhead, come back around and drop the swimming team.
Okay. Good show.
Wally. You look fine.
Good show. How's it? She looks pretty erect to me. She's canted off a little bit towards what would be my left side. Is that correct?
That's affirmative.
Roger.
Okay. We're going, now coming in with the swimmers.
Roger, Swiss One.
I can hear you now.
Roger. You've got four helicopters overhead.
Oh, that'll do.
Tell the fellows I am perfectly comfortable. I can wait as long as they want.
Understand.
Okay. Don't tell them. Don't let them get their hands cut on something on here - go at it casually.
Roger.
Thank you.
Okay, Astro. The swimmers are in the water.
Roger.
I see a little old string hanging along down the side here. Oh! That's my dye marker.
I see your die marker, is very bright green.
Yeah. I can see it through part of my window. Apparently, what I was looking at was the piece of string and that was the dye marker. Howdy fellows!
Do they know I'm all right. I assume, I heard them knock on the capsule.
Astro. Understand you requested you - you want to remain in the capsule? You want to know if we know that?
I assume they do. Don't they?
Right.
Astro. This is the Swiss pilot. The carrier is about three quarters of a mile - closing.
Okay, pilot. I think I would prefer to stay in and have a - a small boat come alongside and using your collar routine, of course, to support me, and having a ship pickup. Over.
Roger. Understand. You want ships small boat. Will give them that word right away.
Okay. I think they are briefed to make a - attachment with a small boat and then hoist me aboard.
Please say again, the last.
I understand that this is the Kearsarge, is that correct?
Affirmative.
She is briefed, I understand, to bring me and the capsule aboard together.
I'll wait one.

Drogue parachute has deployed – the drogue parachute has deployed.
Pilot reports all systems in the cockpit A-OK and operating properly.
The medical monitor in the Mercury Control Center reports the pilot A-OK, all the way.
The main parachute has deployed; the Mercury spacecraft Freedom 7 is now descending on its main parachute.
As was expected at about this time, or in fact rather we expected it sooner than this time, our communication with Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard is getting a little rough.
We did report deployment of the main parachute, we last reported his altitude at seven thousand feet descending. _note: From this point in the audio tape, commentary is provided by personnel from the aircraft carrier USS Lake Champlain (CV-39).
Hello...this is the aircraft carrier Lake Champlain - the parachute and the capsule are still coming down, on the horizon there about even with the clouds, clouds now on the horizon...we are about four miles away from the spacecraft now, it has still not made its impact with the water, the helicopters are about I would estimate halfway through the point of impact, and as we see, the space capsule has not yet made impact with the water. In that lead helicopter ready to pick up the astronaut are First Lieutenant Wayne Koons, the pilot, and Marine co-pilot George Cox.
We're now probably no more than three miles away from the – from the parachutes, they're coming into our – they're becoming very clear now. It's very possible that the carrier will be right close to the space capsule, the spacecraft as its being recovered from the water. It's only a matter of two or three more minutes, it's swaying gently in the wind, from side to side, to one side and then the other, it's a good thing there's a Naval commander inside or he might be getting seasick...
The lead helicopter is now high up the parachute...they're now hovering over the parachute, and will be ready to pick him up out of the water almost immediately.
It just hit the water a moment ago! [Personnel from aircraft carrier heard cheering in background] A cheer went up from the ship's company watching it from all decks on the aircraft carrier – the parachute is now flattened against the water, and from this point we are able to tell how the capsule is riding in the water.
It's too low in the water to tell just how the capsule is riding in the water but there are four or five helicopters in the near vicinity - the lead helicopter number forty four is all right over the capsule.
The capsule is up out of the water – right there for the carrier – the helicopter has hooked onto the capsule...
Correction – the capsule is still floating in the water...as the helicopter hovers overhead to hook onto the capsule.
It's still to early to tell whether the astronaut, Alan Shepard, has tried to remove himself through the top escape hatch of the capsule. He may elect to stay in the capsule, arrive back to the carrier in the capsule, then again if he has removed himself from the capsule he can be lifted into the helicopter to ride back probably a little more comfortably...
The helicopter is hovering right over the spacecraft and of course first they must snip off the antenna from the spacecraft, the radio antenna, the radio...then it will be a matter of hooking onto the capsule and lifting it up out of the water to return here to the deck of the carrier Lake Champlain.
The helicopter is lowering the sling, the astronaut is out of the capsule.
So far we can't tell whether the astronaut inflated his life raft, but he does appear to have gotten out of the capsule – the helicopter has lowered a sling to pick him up.
The sling has gone to the capsule – the sling that was lowered from the helicopter is down to the spacecraft – it's too early to tell exactly what they're going to do. Of course the first thing is to try and pick up the astronaut, get him into the helicopter, if he has removed himself from [the spacecraft], then to hook the spacecraft and return the vehicle to deck.
The astronaut Alan Shepard has just climbed out of the capsule and they are now trying to get him up into the helicopter.
They're lifting the capsule out of the water – they've already hooked it - we can see it plainly as the helicopter lifts the capsule...as referring along to return here to the deck to the carrier Lake Champlain. We can't be more than a mile and a half or two miles away from them now. Flying overhead are at least two of the tracking planes that were out here as well as four or five helicopters to convoy the lead helicopter and the spacecraft back to the deck of the carrier Lake Champlain.
The crew of the carrier is jammed onto the flight deck behind a farrier waiting for the astronaut to return to welcome him aboard...[The crew would have been disappointed] if one of the other ships had picked up the astronaut.
The helicopter took off about twenty five minutes ago, just a few minutes before launch. It's lead helicopter number forty four though that will pick up the astronaut piloted by Marine Corps Lieutenant Wayne Koons of Lyons, Kansas and co-pilot George Cox of Houston, Florida. Cox at this moment is probably sitting in the compartment with the astronaut in the helicopter, but he has been instructed not to talk to the astronaut, answer any questions he may have, they were told, but no one – especially newsmen – will be allowed to ask him any questions until he has been debriefed by doctors. The purpose is to avoid leading questions that may affect Shepard's reactions to his flight in space.
Lift-off.
Loud and clear.
Loud and clear. José, don't cry too much.
Okey doke.
OK, it's a nice ride up to now.
Loud and clear.
Roger.
OK. The fuel is go; about 1 ½ g's; cabin pressure is just coming off the peg; the O<sub>2</sub> is go; we have 26 amps.
Roger. Pitch 88, the trajectory is good.
Roger, looks good here.
OK, there. We're starting to pick up a little bit of the noise and vibration; not bad, though, at all. 50 secs., more vibration.
OK. The fuel is go; 1 ½ g's, cabin is 8, the O<sub>2</sub> is go, 27 amps.
And ...
Pitch is ...
4, 5 ...
Pitch is 77; trajectory is go.
Roger. Cabin pressure is still about 6 and dropping slightly. Looks like she's going to hold at about 5.5.
Cabin ...
Believe me, O<sub>2</sub> is go.
Cabin pressure holding 5.5.
Roger, roger.
This is Liberty Bell 7. Fuel is go, 2 ½ g's; cabin pressure 5.5; O<sub>2</sub> is go; main 25, isolated – ah, isolated is 28. We are go.
Roger. Pitch is 62; trajectory is good.
Roger. It looks good in here.
Everything is good; cabin pressure is holding; suit pressure is OK; 2 minutes and we got 4 g's; fuel is go; ah, feel the hand controller move just a hair there; cabin pressure is holding; O<sub>2</sub> is go; 25 amps.
Roger, we have go here.
And I see a star!
Stand by for cutoff.
There went the tower.
Roger, there went the tower, affirmative Chase.
Roger, squibs are off.
Roger.
There went posigrades, capsule has separated. We are at zero g and turning around and the sun is really bright.
Roger, capsep|cap sep is green, turnaround started, manual handle out.
Oh boy! Manual handle is out; the sky is very, very black; the capsule is coming around into orbit attitude; the roll is a little bit slow.
Roger.
I haven't seen a booster anyplace. OK, rate command is coming on. I'm in orbit attitude, I'm pitching up. OK, 40 ... Wait, I've lost some roll here someplace.
Roger, rate command is coming on. You're trying manual pitch.
OK, I got roll back. OK, I'm at 24 in pitch.
Roger, your IP is right on, Gus, right on.
OK. I'm having a little trouble with rate, ah, with the manual control.
Roger.
If I can get her stabilized here, all axes are working all right.
Roger. Understand manual control is good.
Roger, it's – it's sort of sluggish, more than I expected.
OK, I'm yawing.
Roger, yaw.
Left, ah.
OK, coming back in yaw. I'm a little bit late there.
Roger. Reading you loud and clear, Gus.
Lot of stuff – there's a lot of stuff floating around up here.
OK, I'm going to skip the yaw, ah, or roll because I'm a little bit late and I'm going to try this rough yaw maneuver. About all I can really see is clouds. I haven't seen any land anyplace yet.
Roger, you're on the window. Are you trying a yaw maneuver?
I'm trying the yaw maneuver and I'm on the window. It's such a fascinating view out the window you just can't help but look out that way.
I understand.
You su-, ah, really. There I see the coast, I see.
4 plus 30 Gus.
4 plus 30, he's looking out the window. A-OK.
I can see the coast but I can't identify anything.
Roger, 4 plus 30 Gus.
OK, let me get back here to retro attitude, retro sequence has started.
Roger, retro sequence has started. Go to retro attitude.
Right, we'll see if I'm bad, not in very good shape here.
Got 15 seconds, plenty of time, I'll give you a mark at 5:10.
OK, retro attitude is still green.
He's in limits.
OK, there's 1 firing, there's 1 firing.
Retro 1 (Cuts off Bell 7).
Roger, retro 1.
There's 2 firing, nice little boost. There went 3.
Roger, 3, all retros are fired.
Roger, roger.
OK, yeah, they're fired out right there.
Roger, retrojettison armed.
Retrojettison is armed, retrojettison is armed, going to rate command.
OK, I'm going to switch.
Roger, understand manual fuel handle is in.
Manual fuel handle is in, mark, going to HF.
Roger, HF.
